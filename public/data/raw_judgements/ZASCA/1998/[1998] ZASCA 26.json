That was laid down by a provision in the Public Service Staff\nCode and applied, by way of personnel administrative measures\npromulgated by the Minister of Education, to teachers. This piece of\nunwarranted discrimination notwithstanding, Karen George (to whom,\nalthough she is no longer a party to the litigation, I shall refer as\n\"respondent\") applied for the allowance. She is, and was at all material\ntimes, a legally married teacher in the employ, in a permanent capacity,\nof the two appellants, being the Western Cape Education Department\n(\"the Department\") and the Minister.

    "facts": "Karen Jean George, a married teacher employed permanently by the Western Cape Education Department and the Minister of Education, applied in October 1994 for the public service house‑owner allowance. At that time the Public Service Staff Code, as administered by the Minister of Education, excluded legally married women whose husbands were not permanently medically unfit from receiving the allowance. The Department refused her application on the basis of her marital status.",
    "issues": "Whether the Department’s refusal to grant the house‑owner allowance to a married female teacher, on the basis of a statutory provision that differentiates on the basis of marital status, breaches the constitutional right to equality and constitutes unlawful discrimination.",
    "principles": "The court must apply the constitutional guarantee of equality and non‑discrimination, interpreting the Public Service Staff Code and any administrative measures in a manner consistent with the Constitution. Administrative decisions must be lawful, reasonable and not arbitrarily discriminatory. Pre‑1995 provisions that singled out married women are subject to scrutiny under the equality clause.",
    "application": "Applying the equality principle, the court finds that the provision denying the allowance to married women lacks a rational basis and discriminates on marital status without justification. The Department’s administrative rule, being an embodiment of this discriminatory provision, is therefore invalid to the extent that it contravenes constitutional norms. Consequently, the refusal to award the allowance to Ms George is unlawful.",
    "conclusion": "The judgment sets aside the Department’s refusal and orders that the house‑owner allowance be granted to Karen Jean George. The discriminatory provision of the Public Service Staff Code is declared inconsistent with the Constitution, and the Department is directed to adjust its policy accordingly."
