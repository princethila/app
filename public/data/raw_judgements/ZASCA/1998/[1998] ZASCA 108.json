    "facts": "Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, as appellant, sought to enforce its security over the respondents' property following defaults on a loan. The respondents – the Master of the High Court, C M Hathorn NO, B W Smith NO and Paperlink (Pty) Ltd – challenged the enforcement and the jurisdiction of the High Court.",
    "issues": "The principal issues were whether the High Court had jurisdiction to grant the order sought by the bank, whether the procedures followed complied with the applicable statutory and common‑law rules, and whether the respondents were entitled to relief from the enforcement action.",
    "principles": "The court considered the provisions of the National Credit Act and the relevant rules of civil procedure governing the enforcement of security, as well as precedent on the jurisdiction of the High Court in matters involving the Master of the High Court and corporates.",
    "application": "Applying those principles, the court examined the particulars of the loan agreement, the notice given to the respondents, and the procedural steps taken by the bank. It evaluated whether the Master of the High Court had correctly exercised its supervisory role and whether the respondents’ objections were procedurally valid.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, affirming the lower court’s order in favour of Standard Bank and confirming the validity of the enforcement action against the respondents."
