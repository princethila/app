    "principles": "The Court considered the principles governing criminal appeals, including the standards for overturning a conviction on grounds of legal error, misdirection, or procedural unfairness, and the proper interpretation of the relevant criminal statutes.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court examined the record for any misapplication of law or procedural defect that could have prejudiced the appellant, assessing the trial judge's findings against established legal standards.",
    "conclusion": "The Court concluded that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred; the conviction and sentence were upheld, and the appeal was dismissed."
