The appeal is with leave of the court a quo.\n[2] The appellant’s case in the court a quo, as well as before\r\nus, is that it was, at all material times, the lawful registered\n\nowner of the property and that its property was fraudulently\r\ntransferred, first to the second respondent and thereafter to the\n\nfirst respondent, without the appellant’s knowledge or\r\nauthority. The third respondent is alleged to have purported to\r\nrepresent\nthe appellant in passing transfer of the property to the\r\nsecond respondent. In truth, he had never been authorized to do so.\r\nThe\nsecond and third respondents, who took part in the proceedings\r\nbelow, have filed notices to abide the decision of this court. The\n\nRegistrar did not participate at all in these proceedings.\n[3] The factual background is as follows: A Mr Kuk Siu Wah, a\r\nbusinessman and a Chinese national resident in Hong Kong, visited\n\nSouth Africa in or about 1990. He then bought inter alia the\r\nfollowing companies, Oriental Products (Pty) Ltd, the appellant\r\ncompany\nand Galaxy Minerals (Pty) Ltd. He, together with his\r\ndaughter, Ms Cook Yin Ping, who is for convenience referred to as Ms\r\nCook,\nwere the only two directors of the appellant. The third\r\nrespondent, Mr Hong Wei Qu, also a Chinese national, came to South\r\nAfrica\nin 2001 to work as manager of Mr Kuk’s companies Galaxy\r\nMinerals (Pty) Limited and Flourishing Trading (Pty) Limited in\r\nMtubatuba,\nKwaZulu-Natal.\n[4] The third respondent refers to Mr Kuk as his grandfather. On\r\n18 December 2006, Mr Kuk discovered that the property\nin\r\nquestion was no longer registered in the name of the appellant. This\r\nhe discovered after instructing attorneys in Johannesburg\nto do a\r\nproperty search at the deeds office. After numerous letters between\r\nhis Hong Kong attorneys and Johannesburg attorneys\nit transpired that\r\nthe property in question had indeed been sold and transferred to the\r\nsecond respondent, who in turn sold and\ntransferred it to the first\r\nrespondent.\n[5] The appellant, represented by Mr Kuk, instructed his attorneys to\r\nlaunch the application to recover the property. This happened\nin\r\nJanuary 2008\n[6] It transpired that the third respondent was indeed responsible\r\nfor the sale and transfer of the property. His version was that\nhe\r\nwas authorised by Mr Kuk to look for a buyer and sell the property.\r\nHe alleges Mr Kuk provided him with a special power of attorney\ndated\r\n4 May 2005 authorizing him to proceed with the transaction. Mr Kuk\r\nvehemently denied that he authorized the third respondent\nto sell and\r\ntransfer the property. He alleged that the signatures appearing on\r\nall the documents used to sell and transfer the\nproperty were not\r\nhis. Even Ms Cook disavowed any knowledge of any authority given to\r\nthe third respondent.\n[7] As a result of these material disputes of fact on the papers, the\r\napplication was referred to oral evidence on the following\nissues:\n(a) Whether the third respondent was authorized expressly, implicitly\r\nor tacitly by or on behalf of the appellant to transfer the\nsaid\r\nproperty to the second respondent;\n(b) Whether the appellant is estopped from challenging the first\r\nrespondent’s title by bringing these proceedings in the\ntime\r\nand in the circumstances in which it did;\n(c) Whether the appellant is estopped from denying the authority of\r\nthe third respondent to transfer the said property to the second\n\nrespondent;\n(d) Whether the appellant has established a right to vindicate the\r\nimmovable property, and;\n(e) Whether the first respondent has a claim for compensation for\r\nimprovements to the said property and the quantum thereof;\n(f) Whether the first respondent has a right of retention or lien in\r\nits favour over the property;\n(g) Whether the second respondent has any claim for improvements to\r\nthe property and the quantum thereof.\n[8] Several witnesses testified on behalf of the appellant. The first\r\nrespondent and the second respondent called only one witness\neach and\r\nthe third respondent testified and called a handwriting expert, Mr\r\nIrving.\n[9] The court a quo found that the third respondent was not properly\r\nauthorized to pass transfer of the property to the second\nrespondent,\r\ntherefore the transfer was void as it lacked the prerequisite to\r\neffect registration of transfer, being that the transferor\n(in this\r\ncase the appellant), must intend to transfer and the transferee (in\r\nthis case the second respondent) must intend to take\ntransfer (\nTrust\r\nBank van Afrika v Western Bank & andere\n1978 (4) SA 281\n(A)\r\nat 302 A-F referring with approval to\nCommissioner of Customs and\r\nExcise v Randles Brothers & Hudson Ltd\n1941 AD 369\nat\r\n397-398. See also\nWille’s Principles of South African Law\n9 ed (2007) at 520-521.)\n[10] The above conclusion, which I respectfully agree with, answers\r\nthe first question referred to oral evidence. Considering the\n\nevidence as a whole and taking into account that the credibility of\r\nthe third respondent was at stake, the court a quo rightly\nrejected\r\nthe evidence of the third respondent that he had any authority to\r\npass transfer of the property.\n[11] Before us neither of the parties contest the lack of authority\r\nof the third respondent which resulted in both transfers, ie\nthe\r\ntransfer to the second respondent as well as the transfer to the\r\nfirst respondent, being void.\n[12] It is trite that our law has adopted the abstract system of\r\ntransfer as opposed to the causal system of transfer. Under the\n\ncausal system of transfer, a valid cause (\niusta causa\n) giving\r\nrise to the transfer is a\nsine qua non\nfor the transfer of\r\nownership. In other words if the cause is invalid, eg non compliance\r\nwith formal requirements, the transfer\nof ownership will also be void\r\n– see Carey Miller ‘Transfer of Ownership’ in\r\nFeenstra & Zimmermann\nDas Römisch-Hollandische Recht\n537; ‘Transfer of Ownership’ in Zimmerman & Visser\nSouthern Cross\n727 at 735-9. Under the abstract system the\r\nmost important point is that there is no need for a formally valid\r\nunderlying transaction\nprovided that the parties are\nad idem\nregarding the passing of ownership:\nMeintjies NO v Coetzer &\r\nothers\n2010 (5) SA 186\n(SCA).\n[13] It is correct that registration of title in terms of the\nDeeds\nRegistries Act 47 of 1937\nis a brilliant system of public access to\r\nthe register of owners of property and the registration of other\r\nprotected rights such\nas servitudes. What is even more important is\r\nthe correctness of the contents of the register. It is said that\r\n‘[w]hen the\nDutch settled in the Cape Colony they brought over\r\nfrom Holland this system of registration, and the titles to land\r\ngranted by\nthe governors were registered before the Commissioners of\r\nthe Court of Justice. No sales of this land and no servitudes imposed\n\nthereon were recognised, unless these were registered against the\r\ntitle before the Commissioners’. The purpose is to publicise\nto\r\nthe world and for the protection of registered owners –\nHoutpoort Mining and Estate Syndicate Ltd v Jacobs\n1904 TS 105\nand\nHollins v Registrar of Deeds\n1904 TS 603\nand the cases\r\ncited therein. Even though there is no guarantee of title, the record\r\nneeds to be accurate, though subject to correction.\nThe record\r\nprovides proof of the present registered owner of the property or\r\nright.\n[14] Most cases deal with transfer of ownership of movables, however,\r\nthere is no reason in principle why an abstract system of\ntransfer\r\nshould not be applied to immovables as well (\nKlerck NO v Van Zyl\nand\nMaritz NNO\n1989 (4) SA 263\n(SE) at 273). See also D\r\nL Carey Miller with Anne Pope in\nLand Title in South Africa\n51;\nApostoliese Geloofsending van S A (Maitland Gemeente) v Capes\n1978 (4) SA 48\n(C). Recently this court in\nLegator Mckenna Inc &\r\nanother v Shea & others\n2010 (1) SA 35\n(SCA) para 21 Brand JA\r\nstated that ‘time has come for this court to add its stamp of\r\napproval to the view point that the\nabstract theory of transfer\r\napplies to immovable property as well’. I agree with the\r\nsentiment expressed by him and wish\nto add that in effect the result\r\nis the same whether one deals with movable or immovable property. See\r\nalso\nDreyer & another NNO v AXZS Industries (Pty) Ltd\n2006\r\n(5) SA 548\n(SCA) and the cases cited therein.\n[15] The next question is whether the appellant is estopped from\r\nchallenging the first respondent’s title by bringing these\n\nproceedings at the time and in the circumstances in which it did.\r\nPerhaps it would be appropriate at this stage to give a brief\n\nbackground of the circumstances and the time in which the initial\r\napplication was launched. It is common cause that the third\r\nrespondent held a responsible position in running the affairs of Mr\r\nKuk and the applicant. He became privy to transactions which\nwere\r\ninitiated by Mr Kuk, for instance he knew of the intended sale of the\r\nvery property, which fell through, although he was not\ndirectly\r\ninvolved. He was thereafter contacted telephonically by Mr Kuk to\r\nprocure a new purchaser for the property. Ms Cook also\nconfirmed that\r\nthe third respondent was required to perform various administrative\r\nduties in connection with certain other properties\nowned by the group\r\nof companies.\n[16] Ms Cook in her founding affidavit states that ‘at about\r\nthe end of 2006 and for reasons not relevant for present purposes,\nMr\r\nQu ceased his aforesaid employment and Mr Kuk and I lost track of\r\nhim’. It is common cause that the property was transferred\nto\r\nthe second respondent on 28 December 2005. Already at the end of 2006\r\nMr Kuk started making enquiries from the conveyancer at\nWebber\r\nWentzel Bowens in Johannesburg to ascertain whether the third\r\nrespondent had been in contact with them regarding any sale\nof the\r\nproperty. Clearly Mr Kuk and Ms Cook were suspicious of the third\r\nrespondent’s conduct as early as December 2006.\n[17] By 18 December 2006 the directors of the appellant knew that the\r\nproperty was no longer registered in its name but in the\nname of the\r\nsecond respondent. They did nothing to intervene and put the record\r\nstraight by either writing a letter to the Registrar\nor the new\r\nregistered owner (the second respondent) or launching an interdict\r\nfor that matter. Since the appellant was represented\nby attorneys in\r\nJohannesburg, it cannot be heard, in my view, to plead ignorance of\r\nthe South African system of registration of\ntransfer of ownership of\r\nimmovable property. Ms Cook conceded, during her cross-examination,\r\nthat Hong Kong also has a system of\nproperty registration and\r\ntransfer similar to our system.\n[18] The first respondent’s contention is that the failure to\r\ntake immediate steps to bring proceedings against the second\n\nrespondent amounts to a representation that the second respondent was\r\nthe lawful and registered owner with a right to sell the\nproperty.\r\nThe first respondent further argues that the said failure also\r\ncarries with it the requisite negligence on the part of\nthe appellant\r\nto found estoppel. The first respondent contends that, had the\r\nappellant acted timeously, the property would not\nhave been\r\ntransferred to the second respondent and the first respondent would,\r\nnot have embarked on high scale development of the\nproperty, which it\r\ndid. In order to demonstrate that the appellant acted negligently, Ms\r\nCook testified that in January 2007 she\ndid not know that the first\r\nrespondent had purchased the property and she had not decided who was\r\ngoing to be her attorney to deal\nwith the matter. On the contrary, by\r\n18 December 2006 she knew that the property had been\r\ntransferred and registered\nin the name of the second respondent.\r\nWebber Wentzel Bowens had already informed her of the first\r\ntransaction. Relying on the appellants’\ninaction the second\r\nrespondent sold the property to the first respondent who consequently\r\nstarted developing it. Had the appellant\nacted swiftly the chain of\r\nevents would have been avoided.\n[19] It is generally accepted that an owner of movable property is\r\nestopped from asserting his right to his property only where\nthe\r\nperson who acquired his property did so because the negligence of the\r\ntrue owner misled him into the belief that the person\nfrom whom he\r\nacquired it was the owner and was entitled to dispose of it. (See\nOakland Nominees (Pty) Ltd v Gelria Mining & Investment Co\r\n(Pty) Ltd\n1976 (1) SA 441\n(A);\nElectrolux (Pty) Ltd v Khota &\r\nanother\n1961 (4) SA 244\n(W)). There seems to be no reason why\r\nthis principle cannot be applied to immovable property. The possessor\r\nraising estoppel must\nprove that:\n(a) There was a representation by the owner, by conduct or otherwise,\r\nthat the person who disposed of his property was the owner\nor was\r\nentitled to dispose of it;\n(b) The representation must have been made negligently in the\r\ncircumstances;\n(c) The representation must have been relied upon by the person\r\nraising the estoppel, and\n(d) Such person’s reliance upon the representation must be the\r\ncause of his detriment.\n[20] The appellant contends that there is no proper basis for an\r\nestoppel to operate because there is no evidence tendered to the\n\neffect that the first and second respondents knew of the\r\nrepresentation and that they relied upon it in conducting their\r\naffairs\nin regard to the property. The appellant argued that all that\r\nthe first respondent relied upon was the mere fact of the sale of\nthe\r\nproperty by the second respondent to the first respondent and the\r\nprocess of registration of transfer, which followed from\nthe sale.\r\nThe appellant further contended that estoppel ‘is by its\r\nnature, a weapon of defence, it cannot be used as a weapon\nof attack,\r\nto transfer ownership of a property which, but for the operation of\r\nestoppel, would not have been transferred’.\nThe logical\r\nconsequence of upholding the defence of estoppel is that the person\r\nin possession of the goods or property, raising\nestoppel, acquires an\r\nunassailable right to continue possessing the goods. In my view, it\r\nis still a defence entitling the possessor\nto continue exercising\r\nthat right. In the present case transfer had already occurred long\r\nbefore the defence was raised. We were\nnot referred to any\r\nunequivocal authority, nor have I found any, to the effect that\r\nestoppel can or cannot be used in cases involving\nthe transfer of\r\nownership of immovable property. The case quoted by counsel for the\r\nappellant (\nBarclays Western Bank Ltd v Fourie\n1979 (4) SA 157\n(CC)) simply states the requirements to prove the defence of\r\nestoppel. I consider this point moot in the South African\r\njurisprudence.\nThe present case does not strictly turn on this point.\r\n(See J W Louw ‘Estoppel en die Rei Vindicatio’\n(1975) 38\nTHRHR\n218\nand H J O van Heerden ‘Estoppel: ‘n\r\nWyse Van Eiendoms-verkryging?’\n(1970) 33\nTHRHR\n19\nat\r\n25).\n[21] The relevant period in this case is between 18 December 2006,\r\nwhen attorneys Webber Wentzel Bowens wrote a letter to Mr Kuk\n\nadvising him that the property had been registered in the name of the\r\nsecond respondent and 8 February 2007 when the\nproperty was\r\nindeed transferred to the first respondent. The directors of the\r\nappellant remained inactive for almost two months\nafter learning that\r\nits property had been registered in the name of the second\r\nrespondent. The inaction for almost two months is\nsufficient to\r\nconstitute negligence considering the surrounding circumstances as\r\ndescribed above. One must bear in mind that we\nare dealing with\r\nimmovable property which was the core business of the appellant. It\r\nshould have rung a bell and raised a red flag\nimmediately to Mr Kuk\r\nand Ms Cook after they heard of the new developments in mid December\r\n2006. They only launched the application\nfor vindication on 7 May\r\n2008, almost seventeen months after knowing that the property had\r\nbeen fraudulently sold and transferred.\n[22] I am satisfied in concluding that the appellant’s inaction\r\nwas negligent representation which led the first respondent\nto rely\r\non it to its detriment. Steyn JA in\nGrosvenor Motors\r\n(Potchefstroom) Ltd v Douglas\n1956 (3) SA 420\n(A) at 427 defines\r\nestoppel as a principle in terms of which an owner ‘forfeits\r\nhis right to vindicate where the person who\nacquires his property\r\ndoes so because, by the culpa of the owner he has been misled into\r\nthe belief that the person from whom he\nacquired it, is entitled to\r\ndispose of it.’ (See Voet\nCommentarius ad Pandectas\n, 6 1\r\n13 & 23; P J Rabie\nThe Law of Estoppel in South\r\nAfrica\nat (1992) 86 599; D L Carey Miller\nThe Acquisition and\r\nProtection of Ownership\n(1986) at 263 and\nJohaadien v Stanley\r\nPorter (Paarl) (Pty) Ltd\n1970 (1) SA 394\nat (A) 406).\n[23] In the context of this case, the appellant is entitled to\r\nretransfer of the property but for the fact that it cannot assert\nits\r\nright of ownership because of estoppel. Hence the applicant loses its\r\nownership of the property. It is not necessary to deal\nwith the other\r\npoints referred to oral evidence in view of the conclusion I have\r\nreached.\n[24] For the above reasons the appeal is dismissed with costs.\n_________________\nJ SHONGWE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nHARMS DP (Lewis and Maya JJA and R Pillay AJA concurring)\n[25] I have read the judgment of my learned my colleague Shongwe JA\r\nand although I agree with the conclusion that the appeal should\nbe\r\ndismissed with costs I do not agree with all the reasoning. His\r\njudgment sets out the salient facts and I do not intend to repeat\n\nthem unless necessary for an understanding of this judgment.\n[26] The case of the appellant was that it remained owner of the\r\nproperty because it had been transferred to the second respondent\nby\r\nMr Qu who had no authority to transfer it; and that the transfer to\r\nthe first respondent was likewise void because the second\nrespondent\r\nwas not the true owner and could, accordingly, not have effected\r\ntransfer. Both transfers were consequently void for\nthe same reason.\r\nThe old adage, nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse\r\nhaberet, as formulated by Ulpian (Digest 50.17.54),\napplies: no one\r\ncan transfer more rights to another than he himself has (using\r\nHiemstra and Gonin’s translation for safety’s\nsake).\r\nApplied to this case it means that Qu had no rights to ownership and,\r\nin the absence of the owner’s authority, he\ncould not have\r\ntransferred ownership to the first purchaser. And because the first\r\npurchaser did not become owner it, in turn,\nwas unable to transfer\r\nownership to the second purchaser. All this, in my respectful view,\r\nhas nothing to do with the abstract\nsystem of transfer which, in any\r\nevent, is a well established principle of our law. Because counsel\r\nargued the case before the\ncourt below with reference to the abstract\r\nsystem that it, incorrectly, found that the second transfer was valid\r\n– something\nno one argued before us.\n[27] The real issue in this case concerns estoppel. The two\r\nrequirements for a valid reliance on estoppel at issue in this case\n\nrequire consideration: misrepresentation and negligence. Although the\r\nissues are legally discrete, they become intermingled because\nthe\r\nsame facts are relevant to both issues.\n[28] The first respondent’s case was that the deeds registry\r\nreflected, to the knowledge of the appellant, that the second\n\nrespondent was the true owner of the\nproperty. In his judgment, Shongwe JA has pointed out with reference\r\nto cases dating back to 1904 that the public is entitled to\nrely on\r\nthe correctness of entries in the deeds office. Although the fact of\r\nregistration is not a guarantee of any right registered,\na party will\r\nnot take transfer of immovable property if he has reason to suspect\r\nthat the register is wrong. By knowingly leaving\nthe register to\r\nreflect the incorrect position as to ownership the appellant, by\r\nomission, represented to the world in general\nand to the first\r\nrespondent in particular that the second respondent was the true\r\nowner of the property. It could not be said with\nany measure of\r\nconfidence that the first respondent did not take transfer in the\r\nlight of this representation.\n[29] The more difficult issue concerns negligence because of the\r\nshort period that elapsed between the date on which the appellant\n\nbecame aware of the state of affairs (18 December 2006) and the date\r\non which the first respondent acted on the representation,\nwhich was\r\nthe date of transfer (8 February 2007). Although the application was\r\nlaunched only during January 2008, nothing in my\nviews turns on this\r\ndelay as far as the vindicatory claim is concerned because the\r\ndetrimental act on which the first respondent\nrelies was the taking\r\nof transfer.\n[30] The following facts dispose in my view of this issue in favour\r\nof the first respondent. The appellant knew from past experience\nthat\r\nQu was not to be trusted with company property. The appellant also\r\nknew that Qu had no authority to transfer the property\nand that he\r\nhad in fact done so. It was aware of the value attached to entries in\r\nthe deeds register and it should have known that\nothers could act on\r\nthe assumption that the register was correct by not only selling the\r\nproperty but also by effecting improvements\nthereon. All this called\r\nfor urgent action, which was feasible because there was no suggestion\r\nthat the appellant did not have\nthe necessary funds or expertise to\r\nlaunch an application. The only explanation for the lackadaisical\r\napproach given by Ms Cook\nwas that the company had to find an\r\nattorney. But this explanation does not hold water. The company had\r\naccess to the services\nof the attorney who did the deeds office\r\nsearch on its behalf. Although this is a borderline case I am\r\nsatisfied that the first\nrespondent was able to discharge its onus.\n[31] Counsel for the appellant argued that a finding that the first\r\nrespondent could rely on estoppel meant that estoppel has become\na\r\nmethod of acquisition of ownership while it is supposed to be a\r\nshield of defence and not a sword of attack. That estoppel may\nonly\r\nbe used as a defence is part of English law and since the Roman-Dutch\r\nroots of the doctrine are said to be found in the exceptio\ndoli, a\r\nlegal defence rather than an action, the same may be said to apply in\r\nour law. Whether this formalistic approach can still\nbe justified\r\nneed not be considered in this case even though the effect of the\r\nsuccessful reliance on estoppel has the effect that\nthe appellant may\r\nnot deny that the first respondent holds the unassailable title in\r\nthe property or that the deeds registry entry\nis correct. This means\r\nthat should the latter wish to dispose of the property the appellant\r\nwould not be able to interfere. If\nthis means that ownership passed\r\nby virtue of estoppel so be it. The better view would be that the\r\nunderlying act of transfer is\ndeemed to have been validly executed.\n_____________________\nL T C HARMS\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nAppellants:\nJ C King SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nShepstone\r\n& Wylie\nRICHARDS\r\nBAY\nClaude\r\nReid Inc\nBLOEMFONTEIN\nFor 1\nst\nRespondent: A J Dickson SC\nPegma 178\r\nInvestments\nTrading CC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nAusten\r\nSmith\nPIETERMARITZBURG\nLovius-Block\nBLOEMFONTEIN",

    "issues": "The court had to determine: (a) whether the third respondent was expressly, implicitly or tacitly authorised to transfer the property; (b) whether the appellant is estopped from challenging the first respondent's title due to its conduct; (c) whether the appellant is estopped from denying the third respondent's authority; (d) whether the appellant has a right to vindicate the immovable property; (e) whether the first respondent is entitled to compensation for improvements; (f) whether a lien or retention right exists; and (g) whether the second respondent has any claim for improvements.",
    "principles": "South African law follows the abstract system of transfer: registration of title is decisive, but a transfer is void without the transferor's intention to transfer and the transferee's intention to acquire. Estoppel requires a negligent misrepresentation, reliance by the other party, and detriment caused by that reliance. Cases cited include Trust Bank v Western Bank, Meintjies v Coetzer, and the principle nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse haberet. Registration must be accurate, but a wrong entry may give rise to estoppel if the owner’s negligence leads others to rely on it.",
    "application": "The court found that the third respondent had no authority; consequently both transfers were void. It held that the appellant’s failure to act promptly after learning of the wrongful registration constituted a negligent representation that the world, including the first respondent, could rely upon. This established estoppel in favour of the first respondent, precluding the appellant from vindicating the property despite the voidness of the transfers. The abstract theory of transfer was discussed but was not decisive; the key factor was the appellant’s negligence and resulting estoppel.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The appellant's claim to vindicate the property was rejected on the basis of estoppel, and the order confirmed that the transfer to the first respondent remains effective for purposes of ownership, preventing the appellant from regaining title."
