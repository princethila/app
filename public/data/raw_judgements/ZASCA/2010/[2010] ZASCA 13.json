These awards often give rise to public concern â and they\nare a fruitful\nsource of litigation. Courts (including this court)\nare swamped with unsuccessful tenderers that seek to have the award\nof contracts\nset aside and for the contracts to be awarded to them.\nThe grounds on which these applications are based are many. Sometimes\nthe\naward has been tainted with fraud or corruption, but more often\nit is the result of negligence or incompetence or the failure to\ncomply with one of the myriad rules and regulations that apply to\ntenders. Sometimes the successful tenderer is to be blamed for\nthe\nproblem but then there are cases where he is innocent. Many cases are\nbedevilled by delay, whether in launching the application\n(and also\nbecause the facts were not readily available or easily ascertainable)\nor because of delays and suspensions inherent in\nthe appeal\nprocedure. If the applicant succeeds the contract may have to be\nstopped in its tracks with possibly devastating consequences\nfor\ngovernment or the successful tenderer or both. Conversely, if the\nworks are allowed to be completed, the tenderer that should\nhave been\nawarded the tender would unjustly be deprived of the benefits of the\ncontract. There are also cases where the final judgment\nissues only\nafter completion of the contract. It is not necessary to adumbrate\nfurther. Tendering has become a risky business and\ncourts are often\nplaced in an invidious position in exercising their administrative\nlaw discretion â a discretion that may be academic\nin a particular\ncase, leaving a wronged tenderer without any effective remedy.\n1\n[2]\tThe award of government tenders is governed by s\n217(1) of the Constitution. Awards must be made in accordance with a\nsystem that\nis fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and\ncost-effective. But a procurement system may provide for categories\nof preference\nand for the advancement of categories of persons (s\n217(2)). National legislation must prescribe the framework for the\nimplementation\nof any preferential policy (s 217(3)). This is done by\nthe\nPreferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000\n. It\nprovides that organs of state must determine their preferential\nprocurement policy based on a points system. The importance of\nthe\npoints system is that contracts must be awarded to the tenderer who\nscores the highest points unless objective criteria justify\nthe award\nto another tenderer\n(s 2(1)(f)).\n[3]\tThe\nConstruction Industry Development Board Act 38\nof 2000\nprovides for a national register of contractors. Contractors\nare categorized âin a manner that facilitates public sector\nprocurement\nand promotes contractor developmentâ\n(s 16(1)).\nContractors registered in a particular category are in terms of the\nregulations under this Act considered to be capable of undertaking\na\ncontract in a particular range of tender values.\n2\n[4]\tThe essential facts are these. The Gauteng\nDepartment of Public Transport, Roads and Works invited tenders for\nthe construction\nof a section of Beyers NaudÃ© Drive into a dual\ncarriageway. (The Department is represented in this case by the\nresponsible MEC,\nthe third appellant.) The advertised tender\ninvitation specified the classification of tenderers who could\ntender. It was 8CE PE\nor 9CE, signifying civil engineering\ncontractors considered capable of performing contracts having a value\nin excess of R100m. The\npresent respondents, who eventually submitted\na joint venture tender, did not qualify in terms of the\nadvertisement. (I shall refer\nto the joint venture as âKingâ.)\nThe first and second appellants, another joint venture and,\neventually the successful tenderer\n(to whom I shall refer as Moseme)\ndid qualify. At the obligatory site meeting that preceded the tender\naward those present were informed\nin response to a question put on\nbehalf of King that parties with a lower classification (8CE or 7CE\nPE â for contracts with a\ntender value of less than R100m) could\nalso tender. An addendum to the tender documents issued subsequently\nwas to the same effect.\nKing fell within the lower group and\ntendered. The tenders received went through an evaluation process.\nKingâs tender, having scored\nthe highest points, was recommended in\nthe technical evaluation report prepared by the Departmentâs\nengineer; in the standard submissions\nprepared by the project\nmanager; and in the minutes of the functional sourcing team.\n[5]\tAt the final assessment the Departmental Acquisition\nCouncil disqualified Kingâs tender âon the rule of unfair\ncompetitionâ\nand awarded the contract to Moseme. According to its\nminutes it would have been unfair to those 8CE and 7CE PE contractors\nwho had\nbeen unaware of the change, which would have permitted them\nto tender, to award it to King without a notice in the media. Kingâs\ntender was accordingly disqualified in spite of the amendment of the\ntender documents because it was not in accordance with the\nadvertisement.\n In other words, Kingâs tender was disqualified\nbecause of an error by the Department. The error was, unbeknown to\nKing, that the\ninformation given at the site meeting was wrong and\nthat the Department had failed to change the tender documents.\n[6]\tDissatisfied, King launched an application for an\nurgent interim interdict, which was dismissed on the ground of\nbalance of convenience.\nUndeterred, King launched the present\nproceedings as a matter of urgency, seeking the review of the\ndecision to award the contract\nto Moseme, and its setting aside.\nAdditionally, King asked that the court should award the contract to\nit since its tender was for\nthe lowest price, had scored the highest\npoints, and was recommended during the evaluation process. Moseme\nadopted a somewhat ambivalent\nattitude: it did not oppose the review\nbut only the prayer for the award of the contract to King, and by way\nof counter-application\nMoseme sought an order declaring that the\ncontract was to remain extant in spite of the review. The Department,\nhowever, opposed\nKingâs application in all its aspects.\n[7]\tThe grounds for review were many, all attacking the\naward to Moseme while the real complaint was the disqualification of\nKing.\nIt was for instance said that the award to Moseme was unlawful\nbecause it had not scored the most points; and that the award was\nmaterially influenced by an error of law, was made on the basis of\nirrelevant considerations, or arbitrarily or capriciously.\n[8]\tThe high court (Jajbhay J) granted the relief sought\nby King. In relation to the review he found that the decision was\ntaken arbitrarily;\nthat the matter had not been considered properly;\nand that the Department had taken irrelevant considerations into\naccount. I am\nprepared to accept for purposes of this judgment that\nthe fact that there may have been 8CE and 7CE PE contractors who\ncould have\ntendered but had failed to do so because they were unaware\nof the changed classification was not a ground for disqualifying\nKingâs\ntender. One would have thought that if the Council had\nconcerns about those contractors it would have been a simple matter\neither\nto advertise or to revert to the higher classification by\nissuing another addendum or informing the tenderers of the decision.\n[9]\tHaving found that the award was reviewable, the\ncourt below held, without more, that it was just and equitable to set\nthe decision\naside. It then proceeded to consider whether to remit\nthe matter to the Council for reconsideration or to award the\ncontract to King\nbecause it was an exceptional case under PAJA.\n3\nIt adopted the latter option on both a legal and a factual basis. The\nlegal ground was that since King had scored the highest points\nand\nhad submitted the lowest tender it was a foregone conclusion that the\nDepartment was obliged in law to award the contract to\nKing, and that\nit would have been a waste of time to remit the matter for\nreconsideration.\n[10]\tThe court, in exercising its discretion, added the\nfactual consideration that it was not impracticable to set aside the\ndecision\nbecause, although the work had begun, it was a\nâre-measurableâ contract which meant that King would not be paid\nfor something\nit had not done and, presumably, that Moseme would be\npaid for the work it had completed.\n[11]\tIn assessing whether or not the court had erred it\nis necessary to refer to the\nOudekraal\njudgment where this court said the following:\n4\nâ\nIt will\nbe apparent from that analysis that the substantive validity or\ninvalidity of an administrative act will seldom have relevance\nin\nisolation of the consequences that it is said to have produced â\nthe validity of the administrative act might be relevant in\nrelation\nto some consequences, or even in relation to some persons, and not in\nrelation to others â and for that reason it will\ngenerally be\ninappropriate for a court to pronounce by way of declaration upon the\nvalidity or invalidity of such an act in isolation\nof particular\nconsequences that are said to have been produced.â\n[12]\tA declaration of invalidity\nof the tender award in this case can also not be considered in\nisolation. One has to consider the\npossible consequences. Only two\npossibilities were canvassed: the one favoured by the high court,\nnamely setting aside the award\nand awarding the contract to King; and\nthe one proposed by Moseme and the Department, which was to leave the\ncontract extant. Acceptance\nof the latter alternative would make the\nreview academic. Consequently, it is only necessary to decide whether\nas a matter of law\nthe Council was obliged to award the contract to\nKing and, if not, whether it was appropriate for the court below to\nhave  done so.\n[13]\tKing, in support of the\ncourtâs legal finding, relied on\ns 2(1)(f)\nof the\nPreferential\nProcurement Policy Framework Act: contracts\nmust be awarded to the\ntenderer who scores the highest points unless objective criteria\njustify the award to another tenderer. The\nfirst problem with the\nsubmission is that it fails to take into account the fact that the\ninvitation to tender stated that tenders\nwere to be awarded on the\nbasis of the principle that work will be distributed amongst\ncontractors or entities that have not previously\nbeen awarded\ncontracts. This aspect was not considered by the Council â\nsomething it would have had to consider if it came to an\nassessment\nof Kingâs tender vis-Ã -vis that of Moseme.\n[14]\tMore importantly, the submission ignores the\npreferential system introduced by the regulations under the\nConstruction Industry Development Board Act. The\nscheme of things\nunder r 25 is this: In soliciting a tender the employer must\nstipulate that only tender offers by contractors who\nare registered\nin the category of registration required in terms of r 25(3) may be\nevaluated in relation to that contract. To qualify\nfor evaluation,\nthe contractor grading designation must describe the nature of the\nworks (in this case it is CE for civil engineering);\nand it must be\nbased on the estimated tender value. On the evidence the estimated\ntender value at the time of the advertisement and\nthereafter exceeded\nR100m and, accordingly, the tender invitation had to refer to the\nhigher classification, which it did. The regulation\nstates further\nthat on receipt of tender offers the employer must determine the\nfinal lowest category of registration required for\ntheir evaluation\nand that a tender offer received from a contractor who does not then\nqualify must be rejected. According to the\nadjusted tender amounts\n(including that of King) the tender fell within the higher\nclassification (they varied between R107m and\nR137m). This means, as\nI understand the regulations, that Kingâs tender had to be\ndisqualified at that stage â irrespective of\nwhat the advertisement\nor tender documents had said â unless the employer exercised its\ndiscretion under reg 25(7A) to award the\ntender in prescribed\ncircumstances to someone who has tendered outside his range. Whether\nthe Council could or should have exercised\nits discretion is not the\nquestion. The fact is that King was not as a matter of law entitled\nto the contract and that the court\nbelow erred on this aspect.\n[15]\tSomething has to be said about the courtâs\napproach to the ease with which it considered it possible to replace\nMoseme with\nKing, an approach supported on appeal on behalf of King.\nIt is useful to begin with a reference to\nSapela.\n5\nThe high court had found, and this court confirmed, that the award of\nthe tender was âtaintedâ. The high court had set the award\naside\nand referred the matter back to the tender body. But an appeal was\nlodged, which suspended the order, and the high court refused\nto\nuplift the suspension. This court had to consider whether the high\ncourt was correct in setting aside the contract and concluded\nthat\nthe high court had erred because, at the time the application was\nheard in the high court, the contract had been performed in\npart and\nt\nhe order, if implemented,\nwould not only have been disruptive but would also have given rise to\na host of problems not only in relation\nto a new tender process and\nalso in relation to the work to be performed (para 27). The judgment\nin\nSapela\nconcluded (para\n29):\nâ\nIn my\nview, the circumstances of the present case as outlined above, are\nsuch that it falls within the category of those cases where\nby reason\nof the effluxion of time (and intervening events) an invalid\nadministrative act must be permitted to stand. While the court\na\nquo\ncorrectly found that the award of each of the three tenders was\ninvalid when made, it appears not to have appreciated that it had\na\ndiscretion to decline to set aside those awards.â\nIn other words, âconsiderations\nof pragmatism and practicalityâ were relevant in the exercise of\nthe discretion (para 28).\n[16]\tThe facts in\nEskom\nHoldings\nwere\ndifferent, as was the result.\n6\nThe contract involved ad hoc removal of material and its subsequent\nprocessing and sale. It was not an indivisible contract such\nas an\nengineering contract. The high court awarded the contract to the\ninnocent tenderer. The order was suspended pending the appeal.\nWhen\nthe appeal was heard the contract had just three months to run.\nRelying on\nSapela,\nthe argument was that it was impracticable at that stage to terminate\nthe contract and award it to the innocent tenderer. This Court\nfound\nthat it was not impracticable in view of the nature of the particular\ncontract (para 16).\n[17]\tTwo further comments should\nbe made. The first is that the successful tenderer in\nEskom\nHoldings\nwas, at\nleast in part, to blame for the tainted award because its tender was\nflawed (at para 14). That is not the position here. The\nsecond\ncomment flows from an argument by Moseme that the contract was now\nnear completion and that, because of the intervening facts,\nthe order\nbelow should be set aside. There is a conceptual problem with the\nsubmission. The issue on appeal is whether the order\ngranted by the\ncourt below was correct at the time it issued. Supervening events\ncannot affect the answer although they might conceivably\naffect\nenforceability on the ground of supervening impossibility.\n[18]\tThen there is\nMillennium\nWaste.\n7\nThis court said (at para 22):\nâ\nThis\nguideline involves a process of striking a balance between the\napplicantâs interests, on the one hand, and the interests of\nthe\nrespondents, on the other. It is impermissible for the court to\nconfine itself, as the court below did, to the interests of the\none\nside only.â\nThat contract, which was\ndivisible, related to the provision of services, and this court did\nnot, on finding a defect in the award,\nset the contract aside but\ncrafted an order with care to suit the occasion.\n[19]\tThe judgment in\nMillennium\nWaste\npointed\nout that the difficulty that is presented by invalid administrative\nacts is that they have often been acted upon by the time\nthey are\nbrought under review (at para 23):\nâ\nThat\ndifficulty is particularly acute when a decision is taken to accept a\ntender. A decision to accept a tender is almost always\nacted upon\nimmediately by the conclusion of a contract with the tenderer, and\nthat is often immediately followed by further contracts\nconcluded by\nthe tenderer in executing the contract. To set aside the decision to\naccept the tender, with the effect that the contract\nis rendered void\nfrom the outset, can have catastrophic consequences for an innocent\ntenderer, and adverse consequences for the public\nat large in whose\ninterests the administrative body or official purported to act.â\n[20]\tAgainst that background I\nproceed to consider the appropriateness of the learned judgeâs\npremise that it\nwas not impracticable to\nset aside the decision because, although the work had begun, it was a\nâre-measurableâ contract which\nmeant that King would not be paid\nfor something it had not done and, presumably, that Moseme would be\npaid for the work it had completed.\nI believe that the high court did\nnot consider fully the implications of the order in the context of a\ncontract that has to be measured.\n8\nFirst, each tenderer will weight and price different items\ndifferently. Any particular costed item will as a matter of course\ndiffer\nfrom tender to tender. Then there are items, such as\npreliminaries and establishment, which in themselves provide no value\nfor the\nemployer and for which each contractor would in principle be\nentitled. But it goes further. The setting aside of a contract has a\nnumber of consequences. The first contractor may not be able to claim\nunder the revoked contract and be left with an enrichment claim,\nand\nthe employer may not have a claim for defective workmanship. The\nsecond contractor may even have a claim for damages against\nthe\nemployer in respect of loss of profit on the executed part of the\ncontract because it has now become contractually entitled to\nthe\nwhole contract.\n[21]\tThese problems may not be of any consequence in the\ncase of corruption or fraud or where the successful tenderer was\ncomplicit\nin the irregularity.\n9\nBut, as said, that is not the case. The learned judge, in reaching\nhis conclusion, failed to have any regard to the position of the\ninnocent Moseme. He also did not consider the degree of the\nirregularity. He assumed incorrectly that King was entitled to the\ncontract\nand he underestimated the adverse consequences of the order.\nI therefore conclude that he erred in the exercise of his discretion.\nThis means that King, in spite of the imperfect administrative\nprocess, is not entitled to any relief. Not every slip in the\nadministration\nof tenders is necessarily to be visited by judicial\nsanction.\n[22]\tIt follows that the appeal must be upheld with\ncosts. Costs of two counsel cannot be justified. The order as granted\nin favour\nof King has to be set aside. Mosemeâs counter-application\nthat the contract should have remained extant, which was dismissed,\nconsequently\nbecomes academic. It was in any event unnecessary and\ndid not cause any additional costs.\n[23]\tThe following order issues:\n1 The appeal is upheld with costs.\n2 The order of the court below is set aside and replaced\nwith an order dismissing the application with costs, and making no\norder\non the counter-application.\n__________________\nL T C Harms\nDeputy President\nTHERON AJA:\n[24]\tI have had the benefit of reading the judgment of\nmy colleague, Harms DP. I concur with the reasoning and the\norder in respect of the merits, but I do not agree with\nthe costs order.\n[25]\tThe legislative framework for aggrieved parties to\nprotect their rights in relation to tender procurement has been\ncomprehensively\nset out by Harms DP. However, as this case\ndemonstrates, it is often extremely difficult for aggrieved parties,\nsuch as King, to\nenforce their rights in our courts. The practical\ndifficulties faced by an aggrieved tenderer were recognised by this\ncourt in\nMillennium Waste\n10\nwhere Jafta JA said the following:\nâ\nIn conclusion there is one\nfurther matter that needs to be mentioned. It appears that in some\ncases applicants for review approach\nthe High Court promptly for\nrelief but their cases are not expeditiously heard and as a result by\nthe time the matter is finally\ndetermined, practical problems\nmilitating against the setting-aside of the challenged decision would\nhave arisen.  Consequently the\nscope of granting an effective relief\nto vindicate the infringed rights becomes drastically reduced.  It\nmay help if the High Court,\nto the extent possible, gives priority to\nthese matters.â\nIn appropriate circumstances, a court should be\ninnovative and use its discretion as a tool âfor avoiding or\nminimising injusticeâ.\n11\nCourts should not shy away from carefully fashioning orders which\nmeet the demands of justice and equity. In terms of\ns 8\nof the\nPromotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000\na court, in\nproceedings for judicial review, is empowered to grant âany order\nthat is just and equitableâ.\n[26]\tKing was entitled to participate in a procurement\nprocess that was fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and\ncost-effective.\n12\nI accept, as does Harms DP, for purposes of this judgment, that it\nwas the Departmentâs negligence and\nunjustified\ndisqualification of Kingâs tender that resulted in the latter\napproaching the high court for relief. King approached\nthe court\nexpeditiously in order to protect a legitimate interest but it has\nnot, in my view, received effective protection or relief.\nI am\nfurther of the view that there are special circumstances, as was\nfound by Scott JA in\nSapela Electronics\n,\n13\nwhy the Department should pay Kingâs, as well as Mosemeâs\n,\ncosts in the court below.\n_____________________\nL Theron\nActing Judge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nFIRST & SECOND APPELLANT:\t\t\tJ G Wasserman SC\nInstructed by Van der Meer &\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSchoonbee Attorneys, Bedfordview\nLovius Block Attorneys, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBloemfontein\nTHIRD APPELLANT:\t\t\t\tM\nG\nKhoza SC\nA P S Nxumalo\nInstructed by: The State Attorney,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohannesburg\nThe State Attorney, Bloemfontein\nFIRST AND SECOND RESPONDENTS:\tS du Toit SC\nQ G Leech\nInstructed by Earle Friedman &\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAssociates, Johannesburg\nClaude Reid Incorporated \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBloemfontein\n1\nCompare\nSebenza Kahle Trade\n\tCC v Emalahleni Local Municipal Council\n[2003] 2 All SA 340 (T);\nIntertrade\n\tTwo (Pty) Ltd v The MEC for Road and Public Works & another\n2007\n\t(6) SA 442\n,\n[2008] 1 All SA 142\n(Ck).\n2\nRegulations in terms of the\nConstruction Industry Development Board\nAct GG\n26427, 9 June 2004, as often amended.\n3\nPromotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000\ns 8(1)(c).\n4\nOudekraal Estates (Pty) Ltd\n\tv City of Cape Town & others\n2004 (6) SA 222\n(SCA);\n[2004] 3 All SA 1\n(SCA) para 38.\n5\nChairperson: Standing\n\tTender Committee & others v JFE Sapela Electronics (Pty) Ltd &\n\tothers\n2008 (2) SA 638\n(SCA);\n[2005] 4 All SA 487\n(SCA).\n6\nEskom Holdings Ltd &\n\tanother v New Reclamation Group (Pty) Ltd\n[2009] ZASCA 8\n;\n2009 (4) SA 628\n(SCA).\n7\nMillennium Waste Management\n\t(Pty) Ltd v Chairperson of the Tender Board: Limpopo Province &\n\tothers\n[2007] ZASCA 165\n;\n[2008] 2 All SA 145\n;\n2008 (5) BCLR 508\n;\n2008 (2) SA 481\n(SCA).\n8\nCompare\nDarson Construction\n\t(Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town\n2007 (4) SA 488 (C), [2007] 1 All SA 393\n\t(C).\n9\nMillennium Waste\npara 26 and compare\nMinister\n\tof Finance & others v Gore NO\n2007 (1) SA 111\n(SCA);\n[2007] 1 All SA 309\n(SCA).\n10\nMillennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender\n\tBoard: Limpopo Province & others\n2008 (2) SA 481\n(SCA) para\n\t34.\n11\nOudekraal Estates (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town & others\n2004 (6) SA 222\n(SCA) para 36.\n12\nSection 217(1) of the Constitution.\n13\nChairperson, Standing Tender Committee & others v JFE Sapela\n\tElectronics (Pty) Ltd & others\n[2005] ZASCA 90\n,\n2008 (2) SA\n\t638\n(SCA),\n[2005] 4 All SA 487\n(SCA) para 30.",

    "principles": "The judgment applied constitutional procurement requirements under s 217(1) of the Constitution (fair, equitable, transparent, competitive, cost‑effective), the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act s 2(1)(f) (contracts awarded to the highest‑scoring tender unless objective criteria justify otherwise), and the Construction Industry Development Board Act regulations r 25 (qualification based on contractor classification and tender value). Administrative law principles from Oudekraal, Sapela, Eskom Holdings and Millennium Waste were relied upon, emphasizing that courts must consider the consequences of setting aside an invalid administrative act, the doctrine of impracticability, and the discretion to refuse relief when the order would cause greater injustice.",
    "application": "The Court held that King’s tender, despite scoring highest, was not legally qualified because the contract value exceeded R100 million and the tender documents required the higher 8CE/9CE classification. Under r 25 the employer must reject offers from contractors not meeting the required classification unless discretion under r 25(7A) is exercised, which it was not. Consequently King was not entitled to the contract. The High Court’s finding that the award was “tainted” and its decision to re‑award the contract were therefore erroneous. The Court concluded that the proper remedy was to set aside the High Court’s order and dismiss King’s application, leaving the contract with Moseme.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld with costs. The order of the High Court was set aside and replaced by an order dismissing King’s application with costs and making no order on the counter‑application. In effect, the contract remains with Moseme and King receives no relief."
