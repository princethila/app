The applicant is ordered to pay the costs including the costs\r\nconsequent upon the employment\nof two counsel (to the extent\r\nemployed).’\nJUDGMENT\nMAYA JA (concurring Harms DP, Cachalia, Shongwe et\r\nTshiqi JJA)\n[1] The Commissioner for the South\r\nAfrican Revenue Service (the commissioner) appeals against a judgment\r\nof the tax court ordering\nhim, principally, to furnish the respondent\r\nwith adequate reasons for assessments made relating to employees’\r\ntax, income\ntax and Value-Added Tax (VAT). The matter comes before us\r\nin terms of an order made by the court below under the provisions of\r\ns 86A(5) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (the Act),\n1\nsubject to the reservation of the\r\nrespondent’s right to challenge the appealability of the\r\njudgment.\n[2] The facts relevant to the dispute may be summarized\r\nas follows. The respondent has been in operation since March 2001. It\r\nis\na close corporation and registered vendor for purposes of the\r\nValue-Added Tax Act 89 of 1991 (the VAT Act). It describes itself\nas\r\nan exclusive importer of branded electric home products which it\r\nimports from Taiwan and sells through distributors in South\nAfrica\r\nand Namibia. At the material time it sold an electricity-saving\r\ndevice called Electro Smart (the device).\n[3] The real tussle between the parties (this however\r\nrelates to the merits which are not before us, as will become\r\napparent, and\nI refer to it and the surrounding facts merely to\r\nprovide context) relates to the precise nature of the relationship\r\nbetween the\nrespondents and its distributors. The respondent alleges\r\nthat it sold the device to distributors who in turn, as principals,\r\nsold\nit to consumers for their own account. The commissioner, on the\r\nother hand, contends that the sales to consumers were the\r\nrespondent’s\nown sales because the distributors were its\r\n‘employees’ for purposes of the 4\nth\nSchedule\r\nof the Act.\n[4] The genesis of the dispute can be traced to\r\nSeptember 2004, when the South African Revenue Service (SARS)\r\ncommenced a tax audit\non the respondent’s business under the\r\nprovisions of the Act and the VAT Act. Consequently, SARS auditors\r\nsought various\ninformation and documents from the respondent and a\r\nchain of correspondence flowed between the parties in this regard.\r\nThe exchange\nculminated in a letter containing the commissioner’s\r\nfindings which was dated 14 December 2006. The letter emphasized that\n\nit did not constitute a tax assessment and merely contained ‘findings\r\nbased on a limited scope audit of [the respondent’s]\ntax\r\naffairs’. It set out what SARS believed formed evidence in\r\nsupport of the findings and its legal conclusions.\n[5] The key findings were that:\n(a) in respect of employees’ tax, the respondent’s\r\ndistribution agents, consultants and electricians who installed the\n\ndevices, were paid commissions and incentives which constituted\r\n‘remuneration’ from which employees’ tax was\nnot\r\ndeducted in breach of paragraph 2 of the Fourth Schedule, read with s\r\n79 of the Act;\n(b) in respect of income tax, the price paid by\r\nconsumers to the distributors formed part of the respondent’s\r\ngross income,\nie the distributors’ product sales constituted\r\n‘gross income’ of the respondent as defined in s 1 of the\r\nAct;\n(c) in respect of VAT, the distributors’ product\r\nsales, by virtue of being the respondent’s gross income, were\r\ntaxable\nsupplies constituting ‘consideration’ as defined\r\nin s 1 of the VAT Act on which output tax was leviable under s\r\n7(1)(a)\nof the VAT Act; and\n(d) it was competent for the commissioner to impose\r\nadditional tax, penalties and interest in terms of various sections\r\nof the Act\nand the VAT Act.\n[6] The respondent’s written response dated 2\r\nFebruary 2007 was lengthy and detailed and it vehemently denied the\r\nmain conclusions\nthat the distributors and electricians were its\r\nemployees and the distributors’ sales its own sales. However,\r\nSARS was not\nswayed. On 14 June 2007 it issued a ‘letter of\r\nassessment’, followed by formal assessments dated 15 June and\r\n26 July\n2007, in respect of employees’ tax, VAT and income tax.\r\nBut for the income tax item, SARS confirmed its earlier findings and\n\nimposed certain additional penalties in respect of VAT on the basis\r\nthat the respondent’s management had ‘caused an\nevasion\r\nof tax and/or improper refunds … alternatively they failed to\r\nperform the duties imposed upon them by the [VAT]\nAct’. No\r\nrevised assessments were issued regarding income tax. This was caused\r\nby the fact that although the sales to consumers\nwere still\r\nconsidered part of the respondent’s gross income, the\r\ndifference between its gross sales and the amounts paid\nto its\r\ndistributors as commission or otherwise would be allowed as\r\ncorresponding deductible expenses in terms of s 11(a) of the\nAct,\r\nthus bringing about no change to the respondent’s taxable\r\nincome.\n[7] The respondent did not accept the\r\nassessment. As a result, it invoked its rights under rule 3 of the\r\nrules of the tax court\n2\nand requested the commissioner to\r\nfurnish reasons for the assessment. The request was contained in two\r\nletters dated 25 and 26 July\n2007, which bore 97 detailed questions\r\ntargeted at the three items of assessment. SARS was not inclined to\r\nindulge the respondent.\nIn its view, the ‘request require[d] a\r\nresponse of such extraordinary nature that any response would be akin\r\nto responding\nto questions usually asked in a court of law’. It\r\nthen gave brief explanations in respect of each tax item assessed and\r\nreferred\nthe respondent to its ‘letter of assessment’\r\ndated 14 June 2007 which incorporated the reasoning set out in the\r\nletter\nof findings.\n[8] The respondent joined issue with SARS’\r\nattitude and consequently\nlaunched an application under tax\r\ncourt rule 26(1)\n3\nwhich empowers the tax court to\r\ncompel the commissioner to furnish adequate reasons as contemplated\r\nin rule 3. It sought an order\nthat its requests for reasons be\r\nremitted to the commissioner for reconsideration with directions\r\nissued by the tax court to ensure\nthat the commissioner provided\r\nadequate reasons therefor.\n[9] The tax court found in the respondent’s favour\r\nand ordered a remittal of the letters of assessment to the\r\ncommissioner\nfor reconsideration. Its order further directed the\r\ncommissioner to give adequate reasons for the assessments that were\r\nstructured\n‘so as to motivate his assessment clearly and set\r\nout the findings of fact on which his conclusions depend; the\r\nrelevant\nlaw upon which his conclusions are based; and the reasoning\r\nprocess which led to those conclusions.’\n[10] On appeal, the respondent did\r\nnot content itself merely with defending the tax court’s\r\nfinding on the adequacy of the\ncommissioner’s reasons. It also\r\nraised preliminary objections and questioned this court’s\r\njurisdiction to entertain\nthe matter, the Commissioner’\nlocus\r\nstandi\nto appeal\r\ndirectly to this court and the appealability of the order of the tax\r\ncourt.\nAdequacy of the commissioner’s reasons\n[11] I deal first with the question whether the\r\ncommissioner’s reasons were adequate as it may be disposed of\r\nshortly. In\ndeveloping his argument that the commissioner’s\r\nreasons were inadequate, counsel for the respondent submitted that\r\nthe commissioner’s\nresponse to the request for reasons\r\nconstituted administrative action. Thus, he argued, the response fell\r\nwithin the purview of\ns 5(2) of the Promotion of Administrative\r\nJustice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA) which requires the administrator to whom\r\nthe request for\nreasons is made to give adequate reasons in writing\r\nfor the administrative action.\n[12] Reference was then made to the\r\njudgment of this court in\nMinister\r\nof Environmental Affairs & Tourism v Phambili Fisheries (Pty)\r\nLtd\n4\nwhich endorsed the standard for what\r\nconstitutes ‘adequate reasons’ laid down by the Federal\r\nCourt of Australia in\nAnsett\r\nTransport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd and Another v Wraith and\r\nOthers\n5\nas follows:\n‘\n[T]he decision-maker [must] explain his\r\ndecision in a way which will enable a person aggrieved to say, in\r\neffect: “Even though\nI may not agree with it, I now understand\r\nwhy the decision went against me. I am now in a position to decide\r\nwhether that decision\nhas involved an unwarranted finding of fact, or\r\nan error of law, which is worth challenging.” This requires\r\nthat the decision-maker\nshould set out his understanding of the\r\nrelevant law, any findings of fact on which his conclusions depend\r\n(especially if those\nfacts have been in dispute), and the reasoning\r\nprocesses which led him to those conclusions. He should do so in\r\nclear and unambiguous\nlanguage, not in vague generalities or the\r\nformal language of legislation. The appropriate length of the\r\nstatement covering such\nmatters will depend upon considerations such\r\nas the nature and importance of the decision, its complexity and the\r\ntime available\nto formulate the statement. Often those factors may\r\nsuggest a brief statement of one or two pages only.’\n6\n[13] I am in respectful agreement\r\nwith these views. But I do not think that they have the meaning that\r\nthe respondent ascribes to\nthem for present purposes. It was\r\ncontended on its behalf that the commissioner’s reasons did not\r\nmeet the above test. This\nwas so, it was argued, because the\r\ncommissioner, whose perception of the facts differed dramatically to\r\nthat of the respondent,\nhad failed to disclose the reasoning process\r\nwhich led to his conclusion. The duty to give reasons, proceeded the\r\nargument, requires\nmore than furnishing actual reasons; it entails a\r\nduty to rationalise the decision and obliges the decision-maker to\r\n‘apply\nhis mind to the decisional referents which ought to have\r\nbeen taken into account’ where, as here, the actual reasons\r\ngiven\nfell short of the\nPhambili\ntest. It was clear\r\nfrom counsel’s submissions that what was actually being\r\nchallenged by the respondent were the very merits\nof the assessments\r\nand that it understood the order of tax court to entail, in its\r\nwords, ‘the Commissioner’s reconsideration\nof the\r\ndecisions embodied in his assessments’.\n[14] The respondent clearly\r\nmisconceived the nature of the proceedings. We are not here reviewing\r\nthe commissioner’s reasons\nfor the assessments but merely\r\nadjudicating an application antecedent to that process. Thus, the\r\ncogency or rationality of the\nreasons is not yet in the balance. As\r\nappears from the above-quoted dictum in\nPhambili\n,\r\nthe test envisages that the decision in issue may involve ‘an\r\nunwarranted finding of fact, or an error of law, which is\nworth\r\nchallenging’ and merely requires the decision-maker to explain\r\nwhy he decided the way he did to enable the requester\nof reasons to\r\nlaunch his challenge. It is only when the objection itself is\r\nadjudicated under judicial review that the PAJA test\nwhich the\r\nrespondent wants imposed comes into play. The question now is simply\r\nwhether the respondent has sufficiently been furnished\nwith the\r\ncommissioner’s actual reasons for the assessments to enable it\r\nto formulate its objection thereto.\n[15] Interestingly, the respondent’s counsel\r\nconceded in argument that the volume of the respondent’s\r\nquestions which\ndemanded exacting specificity from SARS was\r\nunwarranted, and, in his words the product of ‘an attorney\r\nbeing over-enthusiastic’.\nMore significant though is what the\r\nrespondent’s own deponent, Mr Dirk Hamish Fyfe, its financial\r\nmanager, said in the founding\naffidavit. He stated that ‘the\r\n[respondent’s] response [to the letter of findings] was lengthy\r\nand answered in substance\nthe Commissioner’s queries’.\r\nLater, in the same affidavit, he said that ‘the [respondent]\r\ndealt with [the letter\nof findings] comprehensively in its letter\r\ndated 2 February 2007, setting out its disagreement with the\r\nconclusions and on that\nbasis declined to provide the required\r\ndocumentation and information.’\n[16] It will be recalled that the letter of findings\r\nformed the basis of the assessments which, as previously indicated,\r\nincorporated\nthe reasoning it contained. Notably, the respondent did\r\nnot, at that stage, complain about the quality of SARS’ factual\r\nfindings\nor that it did not understand why they had been made. What\r\nit did instead, as Fyfe properly acknowledged, was reply in fine\r\ndetail\nas to why it disagreed with the reasoning and findings and\r\nclearly had no difficulty responding to them.\n[17] The letter of assessment, which the respondent was\r\nurged to read in conjunction with the letter of findings, stated in\r\nplain\nterms that the respondent was being assessed for income tax,\r\nemployees’ tax and VAT. It explained the reasons for the\r\nimposition\nof employees’ tax, VAT and the ancillary penalties\r\nand interest. It explained further why no revised assessments would\r\nbe\nissued in respect of income tax. The evidential basis for SARS’\r\nmain factual findings, those findings and the legal consequences\nthat\r\nflowed from them were clearly set out – that because the\r\ndistributors were the respondent’s employees they therefore\n\nsold the device on its behalf and that those sales formed part of the\r\nrespondent’s gross for which it should have accounted\nfor\r\noutput tax. There is absolutely no reason why the respondent would be\r\nunable to formulate its objection, if it has any, in\nthe\r\ncircumstances. And I am inclined to agree with the commissioner that\r\nthis litigation is merely a delaying tactic. Accordingly,\nI find that\r\nthe commissioner’s reasons for the assessment are adequate for\r\nthe purpose for which they were sought.\nAppealability and related issues\n[18] Appeals against decisions of the tax court are\r\ngoverned by the provisions of s 86A of the Act. The relevant parts of\r\nthe section\nread:\n‘\n(1) The appellant in the tax court or the\r\nCommissioner may in the manner hereinafter provided appeal under this\r\nsection against\nany decision of that court.\n(2) Such appeal shall lie–\n(a) to the provincial division of the High Court having jurisdiction\r\nin the area in which the sitting of the special court was\nheld; or\n(b) where–\n(i) the President of the tax court has granted leave under subsection\r\n(5); or\n(ii) the appeal was heard by the tax court constituted in terms of\r\nsection 83(4B),\nto the Supreme Court of Appeal, without any intermediate appeal to\r\nsuch provincial division.’\n[19] It was contended for the\r\nrespondent that the order of the tax court was interlocutory because\r\nit was made pursuant to a simple\ninterlocutory application concerning\r\na preliminary matter of a procedural nature in terms of s 83(13)(d)\r\nand rule 26(1)(b)(ii)\n7\nand would be appealable only if it is\r\na ‘decision’ as contemplated in section 86A(1). It was\r\nargued further that the\norder was not appealable because it did not\r\nmeet the criterion of a ‘decision’ under s 86A(1) set out\r\nin\nHassim v\r\nCommissioner, South African Revenue Service\n.\n8\n[20]\nIn\r\nthe\nHassim\nmatter, this court interpreted the\r\nwords ‘any decision’ in s 86A(1) as follows:\n‘\nThe words “any decision” are\r\nalso used in s 21 of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959. In the case of\r\ns 21 it was held\nthat the “decision” referred to must be\r\na decision of the same nature as a “judgment” or “order”\n\nin the sense in which those terms are used in s 20 of the Supreme\r\nCourt Act 59 of 1959 … A “judgment” or “order”\n\nreferred to in s 20 does not in general include “a decision\r\nwhich is not final (because the Court of first instance is entitled\n\nto alter it), nor definitive of the rights of the parties nor has the\r\neffect of disposing of at least a substantial portion of\nthe relief\r\nclaimed in the main proceedings” (see\nZweni\r\nv Minister of Law and Order\n1993 (1) SA\r\n523\n(A) at 536B) … I do not think that the phrase “any\r\ndecision” in s 86A(1) should be interpreted differently …\n\nTo interpret the phrase literally would be at odds with the generally\r\naccepted view that it is in general undesirable to have a\npiecemeal\r\nappellate disposal of the issues in litigation and that it is\r\nadvisable to limit appeals in certain respects’.\n9\n[21] Section 83(13)(d) was inserted in the Act in April\r\n2003 to give taxpayers an additional right to challenge the\r\ncommissioner’s\nfurnishing of reasons. It gives the tax court\r\npower, subject to the provisions of the Act, to ‘hear any\r\ninterlocutory application\nand decide on procedural matters as\r\nprovided for in the rules of the tax court contemplated in section\r\n107A’.\n[22]\nThe\r\nprovision contemplates two types of ‘decisions’: those\r\npursuant to interlocutory applications’ and those that\ndecide\r\n‘procedural matters’ that are necessarily not\r\ninterlocutory. Many decisions relating to ‘procedural matters’\n\nare not necessarily interlocutory and they may, by their very nature,\r\nbe final in effect.\n[23]\nThe\r\nquestion is then whether the application for ‘adequate reasons’\r\nwas an interlocutory application.\nAn\r\n‘interlocutory\napplication’\n,\r\nin its widest meaning, is one made at any stage between the inception\r\nand the conclusion of the litigation\nin\r\nrespect\nof any\r\nincidental matter\nand\r\nthe consequent order\nwhich\ndoes\nnot finally determine the original\r\ndispute.\n10\nIt must be borne in mind that in this\r\nmatter the application was brought as a fore-runner to possible\r\njudicial review proceedings.\nThere is as yet no dispute between the\r\nparties over the merits of the assessment. The respondent sought\r\nreasons for the commissioner’s\ndecision to determine if it was\r\nassailable. It remains uncertain if the matter will proceed to the\r\nobjection stage. And if further\nlitigation should eventuate, it would\r\nhave no bearing whatsoever on the order of the tax court. Another\r\nrelevant fact is that the\ntax court cannot alter its order; it is,\r\ntherefore, final in that regard.\nIt\r\nfollows from this that the application was not interlocutory but\r\nconcerned other procedural matters, which brings the tax court’s\n\norder squarely within the category of decisions contemplated in the\r\nlatter half of s 83(13)(d).\n[28] I believe it relevant too that\r\nit is now firmly established that matters involving procedural issues\r\nsuch as requests made\nin contemplation of future litigation, for\r\nexample, for access to information under the\nPromotion of Access to\nInformation Act 2 of 2000\nor requests for decision-makers’\r\nreasons for administrative action under PAJA, such as in this case,\r\nmay be appealable.\n11\nCounsel for the respondent was unable\r\nto distinguish the present matter from these\ninstances\n.\r\nI find, in all these circumstances, that the order granted by the tax\r\ncourt is appealable.\n[29]\nHaving\r\ncome to the conclusion that the order was inherently appealable,\nthere\nis\na further\nproblem relating to the\r\norder.\nThe\ncomposition of the tax court was flawed and its order\r\nwas thus not a valid decision. As indicated above, the matter was\r\nheard by\nthe President of the tax court, sitting alone.\nSection 83(4)\nmakes provision for the composition of the tax court and prescribes\r\nwhen the President may sit alone. It reads:\n‘\nSubject to subsection (4B), every tax court\r\nestablished in terms of this Act shall consist of a judge or an\r\nacting judge of the\nHigh Court, who shall be the President of the\r\ncourt, an accountant and a representative of the commercial community\r\nwho shall be\nof good standing and who have appropriate experience:\r\nProvided that–\n…\n(c) when an appeal before the court involves a matter of law only or\r\nconstitutes an application for condonation, the court shall\nconsist\r\nof the President of the court sitting alone.’\n[30] The question which then arises\r\nis whether the determination of whether the reasons furnished by the\r\ncommissioner were adequate\nis a matter of law only. The answer is\nin\r\nthe negative\n.\r\nThe enquiry\ninvolved\nboth\nquestions of law and fact and should\r\nhave been conducted by the Full Court in terms of s 83(4). The\r\nproceedings were, therefore,\na nullity and the tax court’s\r\norder is, for that reason, of no force or effect.\nTo\r\nthe extent that tax court rule 26(8) provides otherwise it must be\r\nultra vires.\n[31] There is another matter that requires comment –\r\nthe manner in which the tax court dealt with the application. The sum\n\nof the court’s reasoning, which follows a long narration of the\r\nfactual background of the matter and the submissions made\non behalf\r\nof the parties, is set out in a single sentence which reads:\n‘\nI am in agreement with the argument of the\r\napplicant and am consequently of the view that the respondent did not\r\ncomply with the\nRules in its response to applicant’s request\r\nfor reasons.’\n[32] One understands that the court\r\nchose the argument that it found persuasive. But merely setting out\r\nthat argument exhaustively\nis no substitute for the court’s own\r\nreasoning, without which it is impossible to fathom why it decided as\r\nit did. The tax\ncourt’s judgment – which, ironically,\r\nrequires the commissioner to explain his reasoning process –\r\nwhilst comprising\n66 paragraphs covered in 32 typed pages, is as good\r\nas a bare order and quite meaningless.\nIt\r\ndid not tell the Commissioner in which respects the reasons were\r\ninadequate and the Commissioner was, accordingly, unable to\nknow how\r\nto comply with the order.\nThat\r\nis lamentable.\n[33] The Constitutional Court\r\nrecently reiterated the importance of a court’s written reasons\r\nin the matter of\nStrategic\r\nLiquor Services v Mvumbi NO\n.\n12\nThere, the court said:\n‘\nIt is elementary that litigants are\r\nordinarily entitled to reasons for a judicial decision following upon\r\na hearing, and, when a\njudgment is appealed, written reasons are\r\nindispensable. Failure to supply them will usually be a grave lapse\r\nof duty, a breach\nof litigants’ rights, and an impediment to\r\nthe appeal process. In\nBotes and Another\r\nv Nedbank Ltd\n[1983 (3) SA 27\n(A) at\r\n28], Corbett JA pointed out that “a reasoned judgment may well\r\ndiscourage an appeal by the loser”:\n“\nThe\r\nfailure to state reasons may have the opposite effect. In addition,\r\nshould the matter be taken on appeal, as happened in this\ncase, the\r\nCourt of Appeal has a similar interest in knowing why the Judge who\r\nheard the matter made the order he did.”’\n[34] The Constitutional Court then\r\ncautioned that a court’s failure to furnish reasons for its\r\ndecision may well violate the\nright of access to courts; a grave\r\nconsequence. The court pointed out another critical consideration –\r\nthat the rule of law\nobliges judges not to act arbitrarily and to be\r\naccountable, which they ordinarily do by giving reasons for their\r\ndecisions, despite\nthere being no express constitutional or statutory\r\nrequirement to do so.\n13\nProviding reasons therefore serves\r\nseveral critical roles, including explaining to the litigants and the\r\npublic at large, who have\nan interest in courts being open and\r\ntransparent, why a case is decided as it is, thus curbing arbitrary\r\njudicial decisions, and\nprovides guidance to the public in respect of\r\nsimilar matters.\n14\n[35] In the result the appeal is\r\nupheld with costs of two counsel.\nBecause\r\nthe court below was not properly constituted the matter had to be\r\nstruck from the roll. And because the application was\nin any event\r\nmischievous it is appropriate to make a costs order in terms of s\r\n83(17)(b) of the Act.\nThe\r\norder of the court below is\naccordingly\nsubstituted with\r\nthe following:\n‘\nThe application is struck from\r\nthe roll with costs of two counsel\n(to\r\nthe extent employed).’\n_______________\nMML MAYA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor appellants: Owen Rogers SC (with him Renata Williams\r\nSC)\nInstructed by the State Attorney\nFor Respondent: TS Emslie SC (with him JL Van Dorstein)\nInstructed by Van der Spuy, Cape Town\nHill McHardy & Herbst, Bloemfontein\n1\nSection\r\n\t86A(5)\nempowers the President of the tax court to\r\n\tmake a final order, granting or refusing leave to appeal against its\r\n\torder, to a party\ndesirous of having his appeal heard by the Supreme\r\n\tCourt of Appeal directly from the tax court without an intermediate\r\n\tappeal\nto the provincial division.\n2\nThe\r\n\ttax court rules were promulgated under s 107A of the Act and\r\n\tprescribe the procedures to be observed in lodging objections\nand\r\n\tnoting appeals against assessments, procedures for alternative\r\n\tdispute resolution and the conduct and hearing of appeals\nbefore a\r\n\ttax court.\nRule 3(1)(a) allows ‘[a]ny taxpayer who is\r\n\taggrieved by any assessment …by written notice delivered to\r\n\tthe Commissioner\nwithin 30 days after the date of the assessment,\r\n\t[to] request the Commissioner to furnish reasons for the\r\n\tassessment’.\n3\nThe\r\n\trelevant portion of Rule 26 reads:\n‘\n(1)(a) Any decision by the\r\n\tCommissioner in the exercise of his or her discretion under rules\r\n\t3(1)(b), 3(2), 3(3), 5(1) and 5(2)(c)\nwill be subject to objection\r\n\tand appeal, and may notwithstanding the procedures contemplated in\r\n\trules 6 to 18 be brought before\nthe Court by application on notice.\n(b) The court may upon application on notice under this\r\n\tsubrule and on good cause shown, in respect of a decision by the\r\n\tCommissioner\nunder:\n(i) …;\n(ii)\r\n\trule 3(2) or 3(3), make an order remitting the matter for\r\n\treconsideration by the Commissioner with or without directions\nto\r\n\tprovide such reasons as in the opinion of the Court are adequate’.\n4\n2003\r\n\t(6) SA 407\n(SCA) at para 40.\n5\n[1983] FCA 179\n;\n(1983)\r\n\t48 ALR 500\nat 507\n.\n6\nSee\r\n\talso Hoexter\nThe New Constitutional and Administrative Law\nvol\r\n\t2 at 244;\nNkondo v Minister of Law and Order\n1986 (2) SA 756\n(A) at 772I-773A.\n7\nFootnote\n3.\n8\n2003\r\n\t(2) SA 246\n(SCA).\n9\nAt\r\n\tparas 10 and 11\n.\nIt\r\n\tis not necessary to decide for purposes of this judgment whether the\r\n\teffect of this judgment was undone by the insertion of\ns 83(18),\r\n\twhich provides that ‘[a]ny decision of the court under [s83]\r\n\tshall, subject to the provisions of section 86A,\nbe final.’\n10\nBell\r\n\tv Bell\n1908 TS 887\nat 890.\n11\nSee,\r\n\tfor example,\nUnitas Hospital v Van Wyk\n[2006] ZASCA 34\n;\n2006 (4) SA 436\n(SCA);\nTetra\r\n\tMobile Radio (Pty) Ltd v MEC, Department of Works\n2008\r\n\t(1) SA 438\n(SCA).\n12\n2010\r\n\t(2) SA 92\n(CC) para 15.\n13\nIbid\r\n\tin para 17.\n14\nMphahlele\r\n\tv First National Bank of South Africa Ltd\n[1999] ZACC 1\n;\n1999\r\n\t(2) SA 667\n(CC) para 12.",

    "facts": "Sprigg Investment 117 CC, a close corporation importing electric home products, sold an electricity‑saving device called Electro Smart through distributors. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) audited the company from September 2004 and issued a letter of findings on 14 December 2006, followed by assessments for employees’ tax, VAT and income tax in June–July 2007. The assessments were based on the view that the distributors and installers were employees of the respondent and that their sales formed part of the respondent’s gross income. Sprigg Investment requested detailed reasons for the assessments under tax‑court rule 3, received a brief reply, and then applied to the tax court under rule 26(1) for the Commissioner to furnish adequate reasons. The tax court ordered remittal of the assessments for reconsideration with directions to provide adequate reasons. The Commissioner appealed that order.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the Commissioner’s reasons for the assessments satisfied the adequacy test required by rule 3 and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. 2) Whether the tax‑court order under rule 26(1) is an appealable \"decision\" under section 86A(1) of the Income Tax Act. 3) Whether the tax court was properly constituted when the President sat alone to grant the order, given that the matter involved both factual and legal questions.",
    "principles": "The court applied the standard for \"adequate reasons\" endorsed in Minister of Environmental Affairs v Phambili Fisheries, requiring the decision‑maker to explain the relevant law, factual findings and reasoning in clear language. Under PAJA s 5(2) a request for reasons triggers this duty. Appealability was examined through the interpretation of \"any decision\" in s 86A(1), as clarified in Hassim v SARS, indicating that a decision need not be final but must affect a substantial portion of the relief sought. Interlocutory applications are appealable where they relate to procedural matters, and the tax‑court’s power under s 83(13)(d) includes such decisions. The composition of the tax court is governed by s 83(4), which permits the President to sit alone only where the matter is purely a question of law; otherwise a full bench is required.",
    "application": "The court found that the Commissioner’s written reasons, set out in the letter of assessment and the earlier findings letter, were sufficient to enable the respondent to formulate an objection; thus the adequacy requirement was met. The tax‑court order was held to be appealable because it dealt with a procedural matter (the provision of adequate reasons) and fell within the category of decisions contemplated by s 83(13)(d). However, the order was declared void because the tax court was not properly constituted: the President had sat alone despite the issue involving factual determinations, contrary to s 83(4). Consequently, the order could not stand.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The tax‑court order was set aside and the matter was struck from the roll. Costs of two counsel were awarded to the Commissioner. The court ordered that the application be struck from the roll with costs of two counsel to the extent employed."
