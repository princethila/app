The second appellant\nis\na legal persona responsible for the administration of the Royal\nBafokeng Nation. The respondent was employed as a team leader\nof the\nVIP Protection Team of the Royal Bafokeng Nation.\n[2]\tA protocol and security meeting\nof the second appellant was held on 13 October 2006 where both first\nappellant and the respondent\nwere present. At the meeting and in the\npresence of members of the protocol and security, first appellant\nuttered the following words\nor words to the same effect to the\nrespondent:\n'Mokwalase, you are fired. I\ndon't want to see you again on my premises. You can excuse yourself'.\nActing\nthereupon,\nthe respondent left the meeting.\n[3]\tAggrieved by the first\nappellant's utterances, the respondent issued summons against the two\nappellants alleging that the words\nuttered, given the context of the\nmeeting, the respondent's position at the meeting and the first\nappellant's behaviour towards the\nrespondent, are wrongful and\ndefamatory.\n[4\n]\tThe\nappellants applied by notice of motion to the court below for a\nseparation of issues in terms of rule 33(4) of the Uniform Rules\nin\nthe following terms:\n'\n1.\tthat\nthe meaning of alleged defamatory words set out in paragraph 7 of the\nRespondent's (Plaintiff's) particulars of claim be determined\nseparately;\n2.\nthat\nin the event that the Honourable Court determines that the words bear\na defamatory meaning, whether such meaning accords with\nthe meanings\npleaded by the Respondent in paragraph 9 of his particulars;\n3.\nThat\nthe other issues in dispute between the parties be postponed\nsine\ndie\nand\nthe determination thereof be stayed pending the finalisation of the\nseparated issues; and\n4.\nthat\nthe respondent in the event that he opposes the relief set out in\nparagraph 1 and 2 above be ordered to pay the costs of this\napplication.'\n[5]\nThe\nrespondent neither opposed the application nor appeared at court when\nit was heard. As a result the application was granted by\nthe court\nbelow (per Matlapeng AJ) on 25 September 2008. The part of the court\norder which is relevant is the one to the effect that\nthe meaning of\nthe alleged defamatory words as set out in paragraph 7 of the\nRespondent's (Plaintiff's) particulars of claim be determined\nseparately.\n[6]\tOn 28 November 2008, the court\nbelow (per Mogoeng JP), without any evidence having been led about\nthe context in which the alleged\nwords were uttered, found that they\nwere defamatory in nature. The learned judge proceeded further and\nfound that the publication\nof the words (which was admitted) was\nwrongful and was published with the requisite\nanimus\niniuriandi,\nie\n'with intent to defame and the knowledge of wrongfulness and it\ncaused the plaintiff to suffer damages. A case of defamation, has\ntherefore been proved'.\nThe appellant\ns\nare appealing against this finding with the leave of the court below.\n[\n7]\tThe\nappellants have launched a three-pronged attack against the judgment\nof the court below. This appears clearly from the appellant's\nNotice\nof Appeal where the three grounds of appeal are set out as follows:\n'\n1.\tThe\nLearned Judge, with respect, erred in finding that the statement was\nwrongful, published with\nanimus\niniuriandi,\nand\ncaused the Plaintiff damages and that a case of defamation had been\nproved, in that the only issue before the Learned Judge, separated\nin\nterms of Rule 33(4), was to determine whether or not the words used\nby the First Defendant were defamatory of the Plaintiff.\n2.\nThe\nLearned Judge, with respect, erred further in finding that the words\nused by the First Defendant of and concerning the Plaintiff\nwere\ndefamatory of the Plaintiff in thatâ\n2.1\nIt\nwas common cause that the words used by the First Defendant were:\n\"Mokwalase, you are fired.\nI don't want to see you again on my premises. You can excuse\nyourself.\"\n2.2\nThe\nPlaintiff limited the meaning of these words to three stings, namely\nthat the words meant that he was:\n\"unable to perform his\n\tduties in a professional manner; and\nalthough being a member of the\n\tROYAL BAFOKENG NATION, was deemed an undesired person on the\n\tpremises of the ROYAL BAFOKENG NATION;\nand\\\nnot even worthy of proper\n\tdisciplinary action and/or the rules of natural justice.\"\n2.3\nAnd\nthe learned Judge ought, with respect, to have found that the words\nuttered by the First Defendant were not defamatory of the\nPlaintiff\nin the senses pleaded and relied upon by the Plaintiff.'\n[\n8]\tBefore\nus counsel for the appellants confined his submissions to the first\nground which he argued was dispositive of the whole\nappeal. The\ncontention was that the court below erred in finding that the words\nuttered were defamatory without having heard evidence\nof the special\ncircumstances surrounding the utterances. He submitted further that\nthe court below erred in going beyond the terms\nof the court order of\n25 September 2008, by, in addition to finding the words uttered to be\ndefamatory\nper se,\ncontinuing to find\nthat 'it is wrongful and was published with\nanimus\niniuriandi,\nie with\nthe intent to defame and the knowledge of the wrongfulness and it\ncaused the plaintiff to suffer damages. A case of defamation\nhas,\ntherefore, been proved.'\n[\n9]\tThe\nrespondent had raised the issue of the appealability of the finding\nby the court below in his heads of argument. The contention\nis that\nas the parties still had to return to court to lead evidence on other\nissues which had been deferred for later determination,\nit could not\nbe said that the order by the court below had the effect of finally\ndisposing of the issues between the parties. However,\ncounsel for the\nrespondent conceded that the learned Judge President erred in\ndeciding that the words uttered were defamatory without\nany evidence\nof the special circumstances under which the words were uttered. He\nargued further that, given the fact that the respondent\nrelied on the\nsecondary as opposed to the primary meaning of the words uttered, the\ncourt below erred in granting separation of the\nissues in the manner\nit did as this failed to take account of the averments regarding the\nspecial circumstances and the\ninnuendo\npleaded by the\nrespondent in para 9 of the particulars of claim.\n[10]\tNotwithstanding the fact that\nthe issue of appealability was not vigorously argued before us, I\ndeem it appropriate to deal with\nit upfront as it might be\ndispositive of this appeal. It is clear from the judgment of the\ncourt below that it had pronounced itself\nunequivocally and\ndefinitely on the issues of the defamatory nature of the utterances\nas well as whether the utterances were wrongful\nand made with the\nrequisite\nanimus\niniuriandi.\nIt\nfollows that once the court below had so pronounced itself on these\nissues, it would not be possible for it to correct, alter or\nset\naside its own order. It is only a court of appeal which would be\ncompetent to correct, alter or set aside such an order.\nSelf-evidently\nthe order made by the court below finally disposed of\na substantial portion of the relief sought by the plaintiff in the\nmain action.\nDealing with a similar situation in\nMarsay\nv Dilley\n[1992] ZASCA 114\n;\n1992 (3)\nSA 944\n(AD) Corbett CJ stated the following at 962C-D:\n'\nThe\nlaw relating to the appealability of decisions of a Court of a\nProvincial or Local Division was re-examined relatively recently\nby\nthis Court in the case of\nVan\nStreepen & Germs (Pty) Ltd v Transvaal Provincial Administration\n1987\n(4) SA 569\n(A). As this judgment shows, this Court has over the years\nadopted an increasingly flexible approach to the question of\nappealability.\nThe general principle which, I think, may be extracted\nfrom the judgment is the following: where a trial Court has under\nsome competent\nprocedure (such as an application under Rule 33(4))\nmade an order which has the effect of being a final decision (ie one\nwhich cannot\nbe corrected or altered or set aside by the trial Judge\nat a later stage of the trial) and the decision is definitive of the\nrights\nof the parties and has the effect of disposing of a\nsubstantial portion of the relief claimed by the plaintiff in the\nmain action,\nthen this order is a judgment (as understood in s 20(1)\nof the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959) and is appealable, despite the\nfact\nthat the main action has not been concluded.'\nBased on the above exposition, I am\nsatisfied that the decision of the court below is appealable. I\nproceed to deal with the merits\nof the appeal.\n[\n11]\tIn\norder to resolve this conundrum, I deem it necessary to quote the\nrelevant parts of the pleadings which reads:\n7.\n'During the\nsaid meeting, the FIRST DEFENDANT, in the presence of members of the\nsaid protocol and security meeting,  uttered the\nfollowing and/or\nwords with the same effect and meaning, to PLAINTIFF:\n\"Mokwalase,\nyou are fired. I don't want to see you again on my pre\nmises.\nYou can excuse yourself\".'\n8.\nAs a result of the above,\nPLAINTIFF had to withdraw from the said meeting with immediate\neffect.\n9.\nThe said\nwords,\n-\nin\nthe context of the meeting; and\n-\nin\nthe context of PLAINTIFF'S position in the meeting; and\n-\nin\nthe context of FIRST DEFENDANT'S behaviour towards PLAINTIFF,\nare wrongful and defamatory of\nPLAINTIFF,\nin that the\ny\nwere intended and were understood by PLAINTIFF and members of the\nsaid meeting, to mean that PLAINTIFF was:\n-\nunable\nto perform his duties in a professional manner; and\n-\nalthough\nbeing a member of the ROYAL BAFOKENG NATION, was deemed an undesired\nperson on the premises of the ROYAL BAFOKENG NATION;\nand\n-\nnot\neven worthy of proper disciplinary action and/or the rules of natural\njustice.'\n[\n12]\tIn\nresponding to these allegations, the appellants pleaded as follows:\n'\nSave\nto admit that the First Defendant uttered the following words to the\nplaintiff:\n\"Mokwalase\nyou are fired. I don't want to see you again on my premises. You can\nexcuse yourself.\"\nThese allegations are\ndenied.'\n[\n13]\tIt\nis common cause that this matter proceeded to trial on the issue as\nseparated in terms of rule 33(4). No evidence was led at\nthe trial.\nNotwithstanding the fact that no evidence regarding the context and\nthe special circumstances surrounding the utterance\nof these words\nwas led, the court below\nfound the alleged\nwords to be defamatory of the respondent. Furthermore, the court\nbelow found the words to be wrongful and to have\nbeen uttered with\nanimus iniuriandi.\n[1\n4]\tIt\nis necessary to recall that the respondent did not rely on the\nalleged words as being defamatory\nper\nse\n. The respondent\naverred in paragraph 9 of the particulars of claim that these words\nwere defamatory because of the context of the\nmeeting, his position\nat the meeting and the manner in which they were uttered. In other\nwords the respondent pleaded special circumstances\ngiving rise to an\ninnuendo. Based on this context, the respondent averred that the\nalleged words were intended to mean and were understood\nby him and\nthe members at that meeting to mean that he was:\nunable to perform his duties in a professional manner;\n\tand\nalthough a member of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, was\n\tdeemed an\nundesired person on the premises of the Royal Bafokeng\nNation; and\nnot even worthy of proper disciplinary action and/or\n\tthe rules of natural justice.\n[15\n]\tIt\nshould be clear from the court order dated 25 September 2008 that the\nissues for separation in terms of rule 33(4) were restricted\nto\nparagraph 7 of the particulars of claim. The appellants' first prayer\nunduly limited the issue to be separated to the words as\nset out in\nparagraph 7 of the particulars of claim. No reference is made to\nparagraph 9 which sets out the context under which the\nwords were\nuttered and the innuendo which the respondent attributes to the words\nuttered. It is clear to me that this was a mischaracterisation\nof the\nissues pleaded by the respondent. Given the issues as pleaded by the\nrespondent, it is not possible to determine if the alleged\nwords\nuttered about the respondent are capable of bearing the meaning\nattributed to them in the innuendo without any evidence of\nthe\nbackground facts being led. This accords with the\ndictum\nby Colman J in\nHassen\nv Post Newspaper (Pty) Ltd & others\n1965\n(3) SA 562\nat 566G-H where he stated:\n'\nWhen\na secondary meaning is relied upon, evidence is necessary because the\nplaintiff must prove the special circumstances by reason\nwhereof the\npublished matter would, to those aware of the special circumstances,\nbear the secondary meaning relied upon. The plaintiff\nmust prove,\nfurther, upon a balance of probabilities, that there were persons,\namong those to whom the publication was made, who\nwere aware of the\nspecial circumstances, and to whom, it can therefore be inferred, the\npublication is likely to have conveyed the\nimputation relied upon.'\n[16\n]\tThe\nlogical conclusion is that the court below erred in attempting to\ndetermine the meaning of the words used without any evidence\nof the\nspecial circumstances being led. It follows that the order of the\ncourt below has to be set aside so that the respondent can\nbe\nafforded the opportunity to lead the necessary evidence regarding the\nspecial circumstances and context under which the alleged\nwords were\nuttered in order to determine whether the meaning attributed to them\nin the innuendo by the respondent is defamatory or\nnot.\n[17\n]\tBased\non the wording of the order of separation dated 25 September 2008,\nboth counsel are\nad\nidem\nthat the\nlearned Judge President went beyond what he was required to decide.\nEvidently he was not required to determine the issues\nof wrongfulness\nand\nanimus\niniuriandi\nat that\nstage. He was only required to determine if the words uttered were\ndefamatory\nper se\nor\nnot. I agree that the learned Judge President erred in deciding\nissues which were not before him.\n[1\n8]\tWhat\nremains for consideration is the issue of costs. The general rule is\nthat ordinarily costs will follow the result unless there\nare\nexceptional circumstances dictating otherwise. However, this rule is\nnot inflexible. It is equally trite that costs are discretionary.\nConsiderations of fairness and justice might, in appropriate\ncircumstances, dictate otherwise.\n[19]\tGiven the peculiar circumstances\nof this case, I am of the view that it would be unfair and unjust to\naward the appellants costs\nin this matter. It is common cause that it\nis the appellants who sought and obtained an order for separation of\nissues. It is the\nappellants who settled the terms of that order. The\nrespondent played no role in that application. I have already found\nthat the\nrespondent's case was mischaracterised in the application\nfor separation of issues. This led to the appellants obtaining a\nwrong\norder which did not take proper account of the respondent's\npleaded case. It is this order which led the court below to decide\nthe\nmatter on the narrow and incorrect basis chosen by the\nappellants. I do not think that the mere fact that the respondent did\nnot\noppose that application is sufficient reason for him to be\nmulcted with the costs. It is important not to loose sight of the\nfact\nthat in the application for separation of issues, the appellant\nhad warned the respondent that in the event that he might oppose\nthe\napplication, they would ask for an order of costs against him. Why\nshould the respondent who exercised his option not to oppose\nthe\napplication, probably to avoid attracting a cost order, be made to\npay the costs he tried to avoid incurring. Aggrieved by the\ndecision\nof the court below, the appellants took the matter on appeal to this\ncourt. It is clear to me that it is the appellants\nwho determined the\ncourse which this matter took culminating in the appeal before us. To\nmy mind justice and fairness demand that\nthe appellants be ordered to\npay all the costs including the costs of appeal.\n[\n20]\tA\ncourt hearing an application for a separation of issues in terms of\nrule 33(4) has a duty to satisfy itself that the issues\nto be tried\nare clearly circumscribed to avoid any confusion. It follows that a\ncourt seized with such an application has a duty\nto carefully\nconsider the application to determine whether it will facilitate the\nproper, convenient and expeditious disposal of\nlitigation. The notion\nof convenience is much broader than mere facility or ease or\nexpedience. Such a court should also take due\ncognisance of whether\nseparation is appropriate and fair to all the parties.  In addition\nthe court considering an application for\nseparation is also obliged,\nin the interests of fairness, to consider the advantages and\ndisadvantages which might flow from such\nseparation. Where there is a\nlikelihood that such separation might cause the other party some\nprejudice, the court may, in the exercise\nof its discretion, refuse\nto order separation. Crucially in deciding whether to grant the order\nor not the court has a discretion\nwhich must be exercised\njudiciously. The court cannot simply grant such an application\nbecause it is unopposed. I regret to say that\nthe court below failed\nin this respect. See\nDenel\n(Edms) Bpk v Vorster\n2004\n(4) SA 481\n(SCA) para 3.\n[\n21]\tBased\non the conclusions made above, I make the following order:\n1.\tThe appeal is allowed to th\nis\nextent:\n(a)\nThe\norder of the court below is set aside.\n(b)\nThe\nappellants are ordered to pay the costs of the hearing of the issues\nwhich were separated in terms of rule 33(4), jointly and\nseverally.\n2.\tThe matter is referred back to the\ncourt below for trial.\n3.\tThe appellants are ordered to pay the costs of appeal\njointly and severally.\n___________________\nL O BOSIELO\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nHEHER JA:\n[22]\tIn\nZweni\nv Minister of Law and Order\n1993\n(1) SA 523\n(A) at 536A-C this Court held that, generally speaking, a\nnon-appealable decision (ruling) is a decision which is not final\n(because\nthe court of first instance is entitled to alter it), nor\ndefinitive of the rights of the parties nor has the effect of\ndisposing\noff at least a substantial portion of the relief claimed in\nthe main proceedings.\n[23]\tBecause I am of the view that, at least, the second\nand third legs of that dictum apply to the present matter, it follows\nthat\nI would strike the appeal from the roll with costs. My reasons\nare, in brief, as follows.\n[24]\tThe application under rule 33(4)\nshould neither have been made nor granted. The separation of the\nissues as formulated was a\nhypothetical exercise. The plaintiffâs\ncase was not dependent on the meaning of the alleged defamatory words\nconstrued in isolation.\nHis case was that the words, in the context\nin which they were spoken and heard, were intended and understood as\ndefamatory of him.\nThat was a perfectly acceptable way of pleading.\n1\nThe defendant took no exception to it.\n2\nThe proof of the plaintiffâs allegation depended on the evidence\nwhich he adduced of the âcontextâ, which he identified in\nhis\nparticulars of claim as relating to âthe meetingâ, the\nâplaintiffâs position in the meetingâ and âthe first\ndefendantâs\nbehaviour towards the plaintiffâ. Within those limits\nthe plaintiff was free to prove facts which conduced to a defamatory\nintention\nand understanding in the words he attributed to the first\ndefendant, the final decision being that of the court.\n3\n[25]\tBut the rule 33(4) application attempted to have\nthe case decided without evidence, not as an exception taken at the\nbeginning\nof the trial, but simply as a preliminary question to be\nanswered. Because of the manner of pleading of the plaintiffâs case\nthe\nanswer to\nthe question was an irrelevance that carried the trial\nnowhere. The defendant was wholly responsible for the application and\nhis counselâs\nsubmission to us that the plaintiff should have\nopposed the application does not mitigate his culpability.\n[26]\tThe fact that the learned judge erred in arriving\nat his conclusion by assuming that the context had been proved and\nwas such\nas to imbue the words with a defamatory meaning, does not\nmean that his final word has been expressed on the pleaded issues.\nOnce\nsuch evidence as the parties may wish to place before the court\nhas been considered and the context, if any, established, a proper\nappraisal can be undertaken of the real issues.\n______________\nJ A Heher\nJudge Of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor appellant:\t\tJ W G Campbell SC\nQ R Mashabane\nInstructed by:\nBell\nDewar Inc\nc/o Kgomo, Mokhetle & Tlou\n,\nMafikeng\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nFor respondent:\t\tB P Geach\nInstructed by:\t\tMoloto Weiss Inc\nc/o Smit Stanton\nInc, Mafikeng\nLovius-Block Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nBecause the plaintiff, having pleaded ambiguous language, was, in\n\teffect relying on a context which lifted his words out of the\n\tnon-defamatory sense and tinged them with the colour of defamation;\n\tand cf\nHassen v Post Newspapers (Pty) Ltd\n1965 (3) SA 562\n(W)\n\tat 566F-H.\n2\nIndeed he would have been hard-pressed to argue such an exception in\n\tthe light of the authorities referred to by this Court in\nCoulson\n\tv Rapport Uitgewers (Edms) Bpk\n1979 (3) SA 286\n(A) at 294B-295H.\n3\nSutter v Brown\n1926 AD 155\nat 166\nin fine\nâ 167.",

    "facts": "In October 2006, during a protocol and security meeting of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, Kgosi Molotlegi (the first appellant) told the respondent, Mokwalase, \"Mokwalase, you are fired. I don't want to see you again on my premises. You can excuse yourself.\" The respondent, a team leader in the VIP Protection Team, sued the two appellants for defamation, alleging the words were wrongful and defamatory in the context of the meeting. The appellants applied to the North West High Court for a separation of issues under rule 33(4), seeking a determination only of the meaning of the alleged defamatory words. The respondent did not oppose the application, and the court separated the issue, concluding the words were defamatory per se, wrongful, and published with animus iniuriandi, despite no evidence on the surrounding circumstances being presented. The appellants appealed this finding.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised three main issues: (1) whether the lower court erred by deciding the words were wrongful and published with animus iniuriandi when the only issue before it was the meaning of the words; (2) whether the words were defamatory only in the context (innuendo) and thus required evidence of the special circumstances, which the lower court ignored; and (3) whether the lower court's decision on the separated issue was appealable despite the main trial not yet concluded.",
    "principles": "The court applied the principles of rule 33(4) of the Uniform Rules, which allow a court to separate issues for a preliminary determination, but only within the scope of the order. It reaffirmed that when a plaintiff relies on a secondary (innuendo) meaning, the plaintiff must prove the special circumstances and that the audience was aware of them (Hassen v Post Newspaper). The court also cited the Supreme Court Act s 20(1) and precedent (Marsay v Dilley) that a decision which definitively disposes of a substantial portion of the relief sought is appealable. Additionally, the court stressed the discretion of a trial judge in granting separation must be exercised judiciously and cannot exceed the matters raised by the parties.",
    "application": "The appellate court held that the lower court mischaracterised the issue by limiting it to paragraph 7 of the particulars of claim and ignoring paragraph 9, which set out the alleged innuendo. By doing so, it decided on wrongfulness and animus iniuriandi without any evidence of the special circumstances. Consequently, the order was set aside. The court also found that the lower court’s order was appealable because it definitively decided a substantial part of the case. The court further considered the fairness of costs, concluding that the appellants, who initiated and obtained the separation order, should bear the costs of the hearing on the separated issues and the appeal.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed. The order of the North West High Court was set aside, the matter was referred back to that court for a full trial on the defamation claim with the proper consideration of context and innuendo, and the appellants were ordered jointly and severally to pay the costs of the hearing on the separated issues as well as the costs of the appeal."
