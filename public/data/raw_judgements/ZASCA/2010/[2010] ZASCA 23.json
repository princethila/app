A contract must be awarded to the tender\nwhich scores the highest points.\n2\nPoints earned for the tender price and functionality and local\nmanufacture may be supplemented by a preference also reflected in\npoints. Such points are earned by being a Historically Disadvantaged\nIndividual (HDI), for subcontracting with an HDI and for achieving\ncertain specified goals\n3\nand also for equity ownership by HDIâs.\n4\nA tenderer who claims preference points on any basis has, as do all\ntenderers, to declare that information provided in the tender\nis\ncorrect.\n5\n[2]\tCorruption\nin the tender process is endemic. This appeal concerns the\ninterpretation and application of reg 15(1) with particular\nreference\nto the duty imposed on an organ of state to act against a person who\nhas obtained a preference by fraud.\n[3]\nRegulation 15\nis headed âPenaltiesâ and provides as follows:\nâ\n(1)\tAn\norgan of state must, upon detecting that a preference in terms of the\nAct and these Regulations has been obtained on a fraudulent\nbasis, or\nany specified goals are not attained in the\nperformance\nof the contract, act against the person awarded the contract.\n(2)\tAn\norgan of state may, in addition to any other remedy it may have\nagainst the person contemplated in subregulation (1) -\n(a)\nrecover\nall costs, losses or damages it has incurred or suffered as a result\nof that personâs conduct;\n(b)\ncancel\nthe contract and claim any damages which it has suffered as a result\nof having to make less favourable arrangements due to\nsuch\ncancellation;\n(c)\nimpose\na financial penalty more severe than the theoretical financial\npreference associated with the claim which was made in the tender;\nand\n(d)\nrestrict\nthe contractor, its shareholders and directors from obtaining\nbusiness from any organ of state for a period not exceeding\n10\nyears.â\n[4]\tThe\nfirst appellant (âVikingâ trading as Tricom Africa) and the\nsecond appellant (Bunker Hill Pumps (Pty) Ltd âBunker Hillâ\nwhich\ntrades as Tricom Systems,) are companies that supply and install\nmechanical equipment for water and sewerage treatment works\nfrom a\ncommon place of business in Bellville.\n[5]\tThe\nrespondent (âHidro-Techâ) carries on similar business activities\nfrom premises in Cape Town. It is a competitor of the\nappellants. The\norigin of the present dispute lies in Hidro-Techâs repeated lack of\nsuccess in winning contracts put out to tender\nby the City of Cape\nTown (âthe Cityâ). Several of these contracts were awarded to\nViking despite the submission of lower tender\nprices by Hidro-Tech.\nThe inference which Hidro-Tech drew was that Viking succeeded because\nof preference points derived from its\nHDI profile.\n[6]\nRegulation\n13\nprovides (to the extent relevant):\nâ\n(1)\tPreference\npoints stipulated in respect of a tender must include preference\npoints for equity ownership by HDIs.\n(2)\tThe\nequity ownership contemplated in subregulation (1) must be equated to\nthe percentage of an enterprise or business owned by\nindividuals or,\nin respect of a company, the percentage of a companyâs shares that\nare owned by individuals, who are actively involved\nin the management\nof the enterprise or business and exercise control over the\nenterprise, commensurate with their degree of ownership\nat the\nclosing date of the tender.\n(3)\tIn\nthe event that the percentage of ownership contemplated in\nsubregulation (2) changes after the closing date of the tender,\nthe\ntenderer must notify the relevant organ  of state and such tenderer\nwill not be eligible for any preference points.\n(4)\tPreference\npoints may not be claimed in respect of individuals who are not\nactively involved in the management of an enterprise\nor business and\nwho do not exercise control over an enterprise or business\ncommensurate with their degree of ownership.â\n[7]\tHidro-Tech\nhad its suspicions about the genuineness of Vikingâs HDI\nrepresentivity but it was not until two former directors\nand\nemployees of that company joined it that it was able to obtain\napparent confirmation.\n[8]\tOn\n17 January 2008 Jacques Viljoen Attorneys of Bellville caused two\nletters to be delivered to the City, addressed to the head\nof Tenders\nand Contracts and marked for the attention of Mr Ian Bindeman.\nTogether they contain the information on which Hidro-Tech\nrelied in\nits application to court as having given rise to the duty on the City\nto act against Viking and Bunker Hill.

Of the R23 500.00 an\namount of R13 500.00\nwas paid by Tricom Africa whilst the further amount of R10 000.00 was\npaid by another entity known as New\nHeights. Furthermore Mr Zandberg\nwas entitled to spend R10 000.00 per annum on the company credit card\nwith no strings attached.\n13.\tWhilst\nMr Zandberg was an employee of Tricom Africa, Mr James, who was a\ndirector of Tricom Africa, received a monthly remuneration\npackage of\nonly R5 600.00 together with medical aid but no company credit card\nor petrol card.\n14.\tDuring\nhis time as director of Tricom Africa Mr James was never involved in\nany meaningful business decisions in respect of the\ncompany and was\nnever informed of the financial status of the company nor did he have\nany access to financial statements, financial\nrecords or any\nmanagement accounts. He was also never informed of how dividends were\ncalculated.\n15.\tIt\nmust also be noted that despite the fact that Tricom Africa has an\nestimated annual turnover in excess of R35 000 000.00 with\nan\napproximate net profit of R1 500 000.00, Mr James, upon resigning\nfrom Tricom Africa, only received an amount of R23 000.00 for\nhis 35%\nshareholding in that company. In addition, Mr James, being a 35%\nshareholder, only received dividends of R47 000.00 over\nthe three\nyear period whilst he was a shareholder and director of this company.\n16.\tIn\ncontrast to the above, Mr Zandberg, was given the opportunity to\npurchase shares in Tricom Systems during May 2006. At the\ntime the\nvalue of the shareholding of both Tricom Africa and Tricom Systems\nwere valued in an amount of R6 000 000.00.\nWe\ntrust that you shall be able to utilize the abovementioned\ninformation in your investigations. We suggest that in the event of\nyou being desirous to contact Messrs James or Zandberg, you do so via\nour offices in consultation with the writer.\nWe\nurge you to treat the abovementioned information as extremely\nconfidential as our client may contemplate legal action against\nTricom\nAfrica and would not like any evidence to be destroyed once\nTricom becomes aware of your investigations into their fronting\npractices.\nKindly\ncontact the writer if any further information or assistance  is\nrequired.â\n[10]\tOn\n8 February 2008 the attorneys followed the earlier letters with\nanother on the same subject:\nâ\nWe\nrefer to the above and in particular to our letter dated 17 January\n2008 which was delivered to your Mr Bindeman by hand on 17\nJanuary\n2008 and the subsequent telephone conversations the writer had with\nyour Mr Bin deman.\nWe\nconfirm your Mr Bindemanâs advices that the fronting practices by\nthe Tricom Group as evidenced by our abovementioned letters\nwere\nreported to your data base managers, Quadrem Tradeworld. We further\nconfirm your Mr Bindemanâs advices that after Quadrem\nTradeworld\napproached the Tricom Group, they were informed that a shareholders\nchange is currently taking place and those details\nof such\nshareholders change will be provided within 7 days.\nWe,\nwith respect, wish to point out that the above actions are not\nsufficient in that Quadrem Tradeworld do not have the ability nor\nis\nit their function to investigate the allegations of fronting made by\nour client. They are merely managing your data basis.\nWe\ntherefore, once again, bring to your attention the fronting practices\ntaking place within the Tricom Group as set out in our letters\nof 17\nJanuary 2008.\nWe\nurge you to have regard to what constitutes a fronting practice such\nas:\n1.\tHistorically\nDisadvantaged Individuals being directors and shareholders are\nintroduced on a basis of tokenism and are discouraged\nand inhibited\nfrom substantially participating in the core activities of a business\nand are excluded from management decisions.\n2.\tThe\neconomic benefits received by a business, because of its HDI status,\ndo not flow to Historically Disadvantaged Individuals\nin the ratio as\nspecified per their shareholding in such business.\nThe\npractices alluded to above cannot be properly investigated by Quadrem\nTradeworld as it is not in their brief to do so, as they\nare merely\ndata basis managers. It is up to the City of Cape Town to investigate\nthese fronting practices and to ascertain whether\nsuch practices are\ntaking place and to act accordingly once such practice has been\nestablished.\nWe\nwish to place on record that our client has suffered damages as a\nresult of contracts being awarded to the Tricom Group based merely\non\ntheir HDI status whilst in fact they were and still are undertaking\nfronting practices. In this regard we refer to the Race Course\nRoad\nPump Station (tender number WR11/2007), which was awarded to them\nwhilst our client had submitted the lowest tender. We also\nunderstand\nfrom our client that an award is about to be made in respect of the\nPotsdam Filter Pump Station Upgrade (tender number\nQ07/114) and that\nthe Tricom Group in all likelihood will once again be awarded this\ncontract based on their HDI status when in fact\nthey are partaking in\nfronting practices which practices are defeating the whole object of\nBlack Economic Empowerment.\nWe\nhave accordingly been instructed by our client to demand from you, as\nwe hereby do, that the City of Cape Town urgently investigate\nthe\nfronting practices of the Tricom Group failing which our client shall\nhave no alternative but to approach the High Court for\nan interdict\ncompelling the City of Cape Town to do so and furthermore claim\ndamages from the City of Cape Town for the financial\nlosses suffered\nand to be suffered by our client as a result of tenders being awarded\nto the Tricom Group of Companies in circumstances\nwhere they are\nconducting fronting practices.â\n[11]\tNot\nreceiving a response which satisfied his client, Mr Viljoen wrote\nagain on 19 February in the following terms:\nâ\nWe\nrefer to our letters dated 17 January 2008 addressed to your Mr Ian\nBindeman, our telefax addressed to your Mr Leonard Shnaps dated\n8\nFebruary 2008 as well as the subsequent telephone conversation with\nyour Mr Shnaps on 18 February 2008.\nWe\nconfirm that during a telephone conversation on 11 February 2008,\nregarding the contents of our letters under reference, we were\nadvised by Mr Shnaps that the City of Cape Town is unable to take any\naction against Tricom at this stage, and that our clientâs\nremedy\nwould have to be to approach the High Court. During the telephone\nconversation with Mr Shnaps on Monday 18 January 2008, during\nwhich\nwriter pointed out various statutory provisions relating to this\nissue, writer was advised to address another letter to the\nCity,\nreferring to the particular applicable statutory provisions, upon\nreceipt of which Mr Shnaps would take the matter up with\nthe Cityâs\nlegal advisors and revert to us on an urgent basis.\nOur\nunderstanding of the situation, after having consulted counsel, is as\nfollows:\n1.\tOn\nthe evidence that we have presented in our letter of 17 January 2008\n(which letter is marked âconfidentialâ), there can\nbe absolutely\nno doubt that Tricom was and possibly still is guilty of fronting\npractices and/or fraudulent representation of its\nHDI status. We\nannex hereto as âAâ and âBâ, copies of affidavits by Messrs\nJames and Zandberg, confirming the contents of\nthe abovementioned\nletter addressed to your Mr Bindeman dated 17 January 2008. We have\nevery reason to believe that these unlawful\npractices are ongoing.\n2.\tThe\nrelevant legislation, subordinate legislation and policy documents\nthat we wish to bring to your attention (although this should\nnot be\nnecessary), are the following:\n2.1\tIn\nterms of sec. (b) of the âGuidelines on Complex Structures and\nTransactions, and Fronting (previously statement 002)â of\nthe\nDepartment of Trade & Industry (a copy of the relevant pages\nbeing annexed as âCâ hereto): â\nFronting\nmeans a deliberate circumvention or attempted circumvention of the\nBBBEE Act\n6\nand the codes\nâ\nand includes â\nwindow-dressing\nâ\nwhich include the situation where black people are appointed or\nintroduced to an enterprise on the basis of tokenism;\n2.2\tItem\n9.4, Vol. 1 of the Procurement Policy Initiative of the City of Cape\nTown (a copy of the relevant pages being annexed as\nâDâ), in\nterms of which a contractor found guilty of â\nmisrepresenting\nany facts in respect of either ownership or empowerment indicator,\neither in a tender submission, or on the supplier\ndata base, in order\nto effect the outcome of a tender, either before or after the award\nof a contract, (shall) with the approval\nof the Implementing Agent,\nbe blacklisted on the supplier data base for a period of 12 months\nand shall be notified accordingly.\nThe effect of such blacklisting is\nthat absolutely no further work may be awarded to that contractor\nfor\nthe duration of the blacklistingâ.\n2.3\tSection\n13(4) of the Preferential Procurement policy Framework Act, 5 of\n2000, which forbids the claiming of preference points\nin respect of\nindividuals who were not actively involved in the management of an\nenterprise or business and who do not exercise control\nover an\nenterprise or business commensurate with their degree of ownership;\n2.4\tSection\n15(1) of the said Act (copies of the relevant pages are annexed as\nâEâ) in terms of which\nan\norgan of state\nmust\n,\nupon detecting that a preference . . . has been obtained on a\nfraudulent basis\n,\nact against the person awarded the contract, and Section 15(2) in\nterms of which an organ of state may,\ninter\nalia\n,\ncancel the contract and claim damages, impose a financial penalty,\nand restrict the contractor, its shareholders and directors from\nobtaining business from any organ of state for a period not exceeding\n10 years.\n7\n2.5\tSection\n8 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, 3 of 2000 (a copy\nof the relevant pages are annexed as âFâ), setting\nout the relief\nthat may be granted together with judicial review proceedings,\nincluding [in sub]paragraph 1(c)(ii)(bb)] directing\nthe administrator\nor any other party to the proceedings to pay compensation and in\nterms of sub-section 8(1)(e), granting a temporary\ninterdict or other\ntemporary relief.\n3.\tYou\nare also reminded of the common law principle that â\nfraud\nunravels everything\nâ,\nwhich is particularly pertinent to this situation.\n4.\tAccording\nto our instructions, apart from instances in the past where our\nclient has lost tenders to Tricom (in respect of which\nour clientâs\nrights to claim damages are reserved), there are two current tenders\nwhich are affected, namely:\n4.1\tTender\nno WR11/2007 in respect of the Race Course Road Pump Station, which\nwe believe was awarded to Tricom on or about 15 December\n2007; and\n4.2\tTender\nno Q07/114 for the Potsdam Filter Pump Station upgrade, in respect of\nwhich the tenders closed on or about 14 December\n2007, but which ha s\nnot yet been awarded.\n5.\tOur\ninstructions are to demand that we be given the assurance by no later\nthan 17h00 on\nTuesday\n26 February 2008, that the City of Cape town will:\n5.1\ton\nan urgent basis investigate, or cause to be investigated, the\nfronting practices of Tricom and act in accordance with the relevant\nlegislation and policy guidelines that we have referred to. In this\nregard we point out that it is of no use whatsoever to simply\nrefer\nthe matter to the database managers, Quadrem Tradeworld (as your Mr\nBindeman has done), who has already advised writer hereof\nthat they\ndo not conduct any investigations âbehindâ the stated\nshareholding of a company; and\n5.2\timmediately\nsuspend all work on the Race Course Project and completion of the\ntender process in respect of the Potsdam Project,\npending the outcome\nof any investigation,\nfailing\nwhich, our client shall have no alternative other than to approach\nthe High Court on an urgent basis for a\nmandamus\n,\ncompelling the City to comply with its aforesaid obligations and a\ntemporary interdict halting the aforesaid projects, pending the\noutcome of such investigations.â\nIn\ntheir enclosed affidavits Messrs James and Zandberg each confirmed\nthe truth and correctness of the contents of the confidential\nletter\nin so far as it related to him.\n[12]\tIn\nshort, the two letters of complaint alleged that Viking had\n(1)\ntendered for and been awarded contracts on the strength of its HDI\nstatus as represented in its tender submissions; and\n(2)\nmisrepresented its HDI status in that its HDI directors were token\nappointees excluded from active participation in management,\ndecision-making and oversight of its financial affairs.\nThe\ncomplaints were buttressed by affidavits from one former HDI\nshareholder and director (James) and one former non-HDI shareholder\nand director (Zandberg) confirming that HDI directors and\nshareholders did not receive financial benefits proportionate to\ntheir\nostensible shareholding and measure of control and that the\nprofits accrued by the award of the tenders were largely passed on to\nBunker Hill, whose directors and shareholders were not historically\ndisadvantaged persons. The inference necessarily borne by these\nallegations is that Mosea, who took over Jamesâs 35% shareholding\nand now holds 70% of the equity of Viking, is likewise a puppet\nof\nthose who control Bunker Hill.\n[13]\tAs\ncounsel for the appellants readily conceded, the substance of the\ncomplaint was serious. It was reinforced by the confirmation\nof\npersons who might reasonably be expected to know the truth. The City\nhad no well-grounded reason to doubt their veracity or reliability.\nI\nwill, for the moment, postpone reference to the Cityâs reaction and\nresponse to the complaint. Suffice to say that Hidro-Tech\nfound it\nunsatisfactory. It was advised that the City had been obliged by\nreason of the substance of the complaint to act against\nViking and\nBunker Hill as contemplated by reg 15(1) but refused to do so and\nthat the City was also in breach of its own Procurement\nPolicy\nInitiative (which had been referred to in its letter of 19 February\n2008).\n[14]\tHidro-Tech\napplied to the Cape High Court for an order against the City and\nViking in the following terms:\nâ\nThat\na\nrule\nnisi\nbe\nissued calling upon the First Respondent and any other interested\nparties to show cause, on a date to be determined by this Honourable\nCourt, why an order in the following terms should not be made:\n2.1\tThat\nthe First Respondent be ordered to act against the Second Respondent\nin accordance with section 15 of the Regulations promulgated\nin terms\nof the\nPreferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, 5 of 2000\n;\n2.2\tThat\nthe First Respondent acts against the Second Respondent in accordance\nwith item 9.4 of the Procurement Policy Initiative\nof the City of\nCape Town;\n2.3\tIn\nthe alternative to paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above, and only in the\nevent of the Honourable Court finding that further investigation\nis\nrequired in order to enable the First Respondent to so act against\nthe Second Respondent, that the First Respondent\n8\nbe ordered to conduct or cause to be conducted a sufficiently\nthorough investigation into the Applicantâs complaint of fronting\npractices by the Second Respondent, which investigations must be\nconcluded within a reasonable time period, but no longer than two\nmonths from the date of such order;\n2.4\tThat,\nin the event of the Honourable Court ordering that a further\ninvestigation is required as prayed for in paragraph 2.3 above,\nno\ntenders for contracts be awarded to the Second Respondent by the\nFirst Respondent, pending the conclusion of such investigation;\n2.5\tCosts\nof the application to be borne by the Respondentsâ.\n[\n15]\tViking,\nBunker Hill and the City opposed. The companies made common cause and\nfiled extensive affidavits supported by the production\nof minutes of\nmeetings of Vikingâs\ndirectors\nand Management Meetings of âthe Tricom Groupâ and âthe Tricom\nBoardâ as well as a Shareholdersâ Agreement between\nthe\nshareholders of Viking concluded on 3 August 2004 to which Messrs\nMosea and James as well as other (white) shareholders were\nparties.\nThe primary focus of the opposition appeared to be the rebuttal of\nwhat was perceived as a case of fraudulent misrepresentation\nmade in\nthe founding affidavit. As counsel for the appellants conceded, that\napproach was misconceived because the true nature of\nHidro-Techâs\ncase was to persuade the court that\nthe\nsubstance of the complaint\nwas sufficient to trigger the Cityâs duty under reg 15(1).\n[16]\tThe\naffidavits filed on behalf of the City, deposed to by Messrs Bindeman\nand Shnaps, were principally addressed to establishing\nthat the City\nhad given (and would continue to give) serious attention to the\ncomplaint.\n[17]\tThe\napplication was argued before Irish AJ. He made a final order in the\nfollowing terms:\nâ\n1.\tThe\nFirst Respondent is ordered to act against the Second Respondent in\naccordance with\nsection 15\nof the Regulations promulgated in terms of\nthe\nPreferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000\n;\n2.\tThe\nFirst, Second and Third Respondents are ordered , jointly and\nseverally, to pay the costs of the application, including the\ncosts\noccasioned by the amendment of the notice of motion.â\n9\nThe\ncareful judgment of the learned judge is now reported as\nHidro-Tech\nSystems (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town and Others\n2010 (1) SA 483\n(C).\n[18]\tThe\nkey findings of the learned judge may conveniently be summarised in\nhis own words:\nâ\nOn\nthe probabilities established by the Second Respondentâs own\ndocumentation together with the allegations of the applicant which\nhave not been denied, I am satisfied that neither James nor Mosea\nwere actively involved in the management of the Second Respondent\nor\nexercised control over it to an extent commensurate with their\nrespective shareholdings at the time of the\nsubmissions\nby the Second Respondent of the tenders awarded in\nthe\nyears 2006 and 2007 and set out in annexure âRJV3â to the\nfounding affidavit.â\n10\nAs\nto the role played by the City, the learned judge wrote:\nâ\nIt\nis probably true that the First Respondentâs officials felt\nsomewhat unsure of their powers, given the wording of the\nregulations.\nBut they nevertheless did regard themselves as obliged\nto investigate the complaint. The real problem is that their\ninvestigation\ndid not address the complaint.\n11\nâ\nI\naccordingly find that the applicant was justified, firstly, in\nbringing the complaint to the attention of the First Respondent and,\nsecondly, in forming the opinion that the First Respondentâs\nresponse to such complaint was wholly inadequate to safeguard the\napplicantâs constitutional rights and legitimate commercial\ninterests.â\n12\n[19]\tAs\nto the proper interpretation of reg 15 in the context of the Act and\nRegulations designed to fulfil the constitutional role\nof a mechanism\nto ensure openness and accountability in public procurement, Irish AJ\nconcluded:\nâ\nIf\nthe Minister had intended that action only be taken âafter\nestablishingâ, or âafter satisfying itselfâ or any other of\nthe\nmany other phrases routinely employed in regulatory enactments, he\nwould presumably have said so. In my view, in employing the\nparticiple âdetectingâ, the Minister intended to cast a very wide\nnet, precisely so as to ensure that an organ of state be proactive\nin\nresponding to the reasonable possibility that a preference has been\nobtained fraudulently, or that a specific goal of its preferential\npolicy in terms of which a contract was awarded is not being\npursued.â\n13\nAnd,\nfurther:\nâ\nIn\nmy view, the action to be taken by the organ of state is dependent\nupon the nature of the information that reaches it. If that\ninformation constitutes what is at face value no more than a credible\ncomplaint, seriously advanced, of the obtaining of a preference\nby\nfraudulent means, then the organ of state must act (and would\npresumably usually so do) by requiring the tenderer in question\nto\nprovide proof of its real and operative HDI status. The organ of\nstate might appoint a forensic accountant to analyse any proof\nfurnished on its behalf; or to assist it in calling for such further\ndocumentation as might be required. There is no undue hardship\nin\nrequiring a tenderer who has claimed a certain status from being\nrequired to justify that claim. Indeed, an entity that does not\nwish\nto be put in the position of having to justify a claimed HDI status,\nshould not claim such when tendering.â\n14\n[20]\tIrish\nAJ granted the unsuccessful respondents leave to appeal to this\nCourt. The City did not participate in the appeal. It elected\nto\nabide our decision.\n[21]\tCounsel\nwere\nad idem\nbefore\nus that the court\na quo\nhad\nerred in entering upon an assessment of the probabilities and in\nrelying upon evidence adduced in the application that went beyond\nthe\ncontent of the complaint to the City.\n[22]\tI\nhope I do Mr Dickerson, counsel for the appellants, no injustice when\nI describe his argument as consisting of two major submissions,\none\nfactual, the other legal.\n[23]\tThe\nfirst argument was to the following effect:\n1.\tHidro-Tech\nhad, both in its correspondence and founding affidavit, made claim\nonly to an investigation by the City. Its grouse\nwas that the\ninvestigation which the City had purported to undertake did not\naddress the complaint.\n2.\tViking\nand Bunker Hill had never been opposed to a proper investigation by\nthe City. But a failure to investigate properly or at\nall was\ninsufficient to breach reg 15 because the compulsion to act could\nonly arise after the completion of any investigation. Until\nthen\nthere could not be said to be a detection of fraudulent preferment\nbecause to âdetectâ meant to âestablish as a factâ.\n3.\tFrom\nthe evidence placed before the court\na\nquo\n, the City regarded\ninvestigation of the complaint as necessary. It was equally clear\nthat its investigation had not been completed\nbefore the application\nwas brought. Therefore the duty to act had not arisen, could not have\nbeen breached and the order of the court\na\nquo\nthat its act was\nincompetent or, at least, premature.\n[24]\tI\ndo not agree with counselâs analysis of the correspondence or the\nfounding averments. The thrust of Mr Viljoenâs letters\nto the City\nwas the spelling out of facts which justified an immediate inference\nof fraudulent preferment: â. . . there can be\nabsolutely no doubt\nthat Tricom was and possibly still is guilty of fronting practicesâ\n(letter of 19 February 2008). In the same\nletter he called upon the\nCity, âon an urgent basisâ to âinvestigate . . . and actâ. In\nmy view the call to investigate was\nnot an acknowledgement that the\nfraud was not established on the face of the complaint, but was\nmerely a practical recognition that\nthe City might first wish to try\nto confirm the allegations. The cardinal response which Hidro-Tech\ndemanded was action.\n[25]\tThe\ncontent of the founding affidavit is in essence a reiteration of the\nfactual allegations made in the letters. The case is\nnot that\nVikingâs HDI participation\nmay\nbe\na sham but that it\nis\na sham and that Viking\nis\nsimply a front for Bunker Hill\n15\nand that the tenders\nwere\nobtained unlawfully\n16\n.\nIt is the\nfacts\nwhich have been brought to the Cityâs attention âto no availâ\n17\nnot merely Hidro-Techâs subjective suspicions. The deponent says\nthat Hidro-Tech has no alternative but to seek an order against\nthe\nCity âto comply with its statutory obligations to investigate the\nApplicantâs complaints and act against [Viking and/or Bunker\nHill]\naccordingly, thus drawing a clear distinction between investigating\nthe complaint and acting upon it, but claiming relief in\nboth forms\n(as did the Notice of Motion). Later in the founding affidavit the\napplicant states unequivocally that âthe evidenceâ\n(ie the same\naverments as those in the letters of complaint) âclearly shows\nunlawful fronting practicesâ giving rise to an alleged\nclear right\nin the applicant.\n18\n[26]\tIn\nsummary, I am left in no doubt that Hidro-Tech relied on the\nsufficiency of the complaint to trigger the duty to act and regarded\ninvestigation as a fall-back option. That being so, the order granted\nby Irish AJ was consonant with the case made out.\n[27]\tIn\nso far as it was argued on behalf of Hidro-Tech (and Irish AJ found)\nthat the Cityâs investigation did not address the complaint,\nthe\nthrust was twofold: the City was delaying in acting upon the\ncomplaint to no purpose and, for the purpose of the alternative\nrelief directed to a proper investigation, to show that what the City\nrelied on as compliance with the duty to investigate was in\nfact no\ncompliance at all. That argument was not an indication that\nHidro-Tech rested its complaint or its case solely on an alleged\nduty\nto\ninvestigate.\n[28]\tHaving\nfound that Hidro-Tech indeed relied on a breach of a duty to act, as\nreg 15 requires, it follows that the learned judge\nwould have been\nwrong to order the City to carry out an investigation. That is so\nbecause the duty is not circumscribed in that regulation.\nThe organ\nof state has the primary responsibility to decide on the form of\naction that it regards as appropriate. The court\na\nquo\nhad only to find that\nthe duty to act had been triggered by the complaint.\n[29]\tBut\nthe duty to act only arises once a fraudulent preference has been\ndetected by an organ of state. That brings me to Mr Dickersonâs\nsecond, legal, submission, which I summarise as follows:\n1.\tOn\na proper interpretation of s 15 there can be no âdetectionâ of\nthe obtaining of a fraudulent preference unless the existence\nof that\njurisdictional fact is established to the satisfaction of the organ\nof state. Such establishment requires more than suspicion\nor even\nprima facie proof: the organ of state must be satisfied that the\ncomplaint is proved as a fact.\n2.\tIn\nsupport of this degree of proof Mr Dickerson argued that âdetectionâ\nis, in the context of reg 15, an administrative act\nwhich requires\nthe application of principles of fairness, including the affording to\nthe party complained against insight into the\ncomplaint and the\nopportunity to address it before a conclusion is reached by the City.\n3.\tFurthermore,\nreg 15 is punitive in its purpose and effect. Because âdetectionâ\nleads to penal consequences the organ of state\ncannot be expected to\nact before it is certain of its facts.\n[30]\tIrish\nAJ undertook a careful analysis of reg 15(1) with particular regard\nto its place in the promotion of the process established\nby\nparliament in order to satisfy the constitutional imperatives.\n19\nI do not think I can improve on it. He examined the possible meaning\nand scope of the phrase âupon detectingâ in the context\nthat he\nhad thus identified. I agree with both the process of his reasoning\nand his conclusion that:\nâ\nIn\nmy view, in employing the participle âdetectingâ the Minister\nintended to cast a very wide net, precisely so as to ensure that\nan\norgan of State be proactive in responding to the reasonable\npossibility that a preference has been fraudulently [obtained], or\nthat a specific goal of its preferential policy, in terms of which a\ncontract was awarded, is not being pursued.â\n20\n[31]\tI\nwish to add only two comments to the reasoning of the learned judge.\nThe first is that because âdetectâ connotes the discovery\nor\nawareness of a certain state of affairs not previously known to the\nperson who so detects, it would strain the meaning unduly\nto limit it\nto a conclusion reached at the end of a process of investigation or\nconfirmation; in everyday speech âdetectâ bears\nthe sense of a\nprovisional or unilateral opinion as to the given state (as in âI\ndetect hesitation in your voiceâ) which is open\nto contradiction\nrather than carrying the force of a final judgment on the matter. The\nsecond is that the range of action open to\nan organ of state is\nlimited only by its appropriateness to the proper addressing of the\nfraud detected by it. The clearer the fraud\nthe more decisive the\naction is likely to be. (But the option of further investigation\nwhere the City is unsure is not excluded.)\nOne of the most common\nways of dealing (properly) with an allegation of fraud is to refer\nthe complaint to the police or director\nof public prosecutions. In\nneither instance need investigation be completed by the person who\nrefers it or before it is referred,\nnor is that person required to\nachieve any particular level of proof in his own mind before he so\nacts, so long as he is not motivated\nby malice in so doing.\n[32]\tI\ndo not agree with Mr Dickerson that reg 15 is punitive as a whole. It\nis true that the detection and action contemplated in\nsubreg (1) may\nlead to a remedy at the instance of the organ of state which may take\nthe form of one of the types of redress for\nwhich subreg (2)\nprovides. But subreg (1) is essentially remedial in nature: it\nensures that no organ of state will remain passive\nin the face of\nevidence of fraudulent preferment but is obliged to take appropriate\nsteps to correct the situation. The remedies\nto which subreg (2)\nrefers are discretionary and, if invoked, need not be an immediate\nconsequence of the action contemplated in\nsubreg (1).\n[33]\tThe\nfact that reg 15 bears the caption âPenaltiesâ is neither here\nnor there. The\nimportance of headings in\nthe interpretation of statutes is well-recognised.\n21\nBut I am by no means certain that the same rule should be applied to\nsubordinate legislation (such as these regulations) more particularly\nwhen regard is had to the rationale for permitting reference to\nheadings but not to side-notes:\nS\nv Liberty Shipping and Forwarding\n1982\n(4) SA 280\n(D) at 285E-F.\n22\nIt is, however, unnecessary to resolve the question since the heading\nâPenaltiesâ is reconcilable with the potentially damaging\nconsequences of action against a party responsible for obtaining a\ntender preference through fraud even if such action falls outside\nof\nreliance on the remedies referred to in subreg (2). Thus no conflict\nwith the interpretation placed on reg 15(1) by Irish AJ flows\nfrom\nthe caption.\n[34]\tNor\nam I able to agree with counsel that the detection of fraud which reg\n15 contemplates is\nper se\nâadministrative actionâ within the definition in s 1 of the\nPromotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (âPAJAâ). If\nsuch a detection is overtly made (and it need not be) and an organ of\nstate has evidence that a tender has been procured through\na\nfraudulent preference, the detection does not of itself have the\ncapacity to affect the rights of any person.\n23\nNor does it exercise a direct, external effect (although it may do so\nwithin the organ inasmuch as it is bound to act upon the fraud\nthat\nit has detected). Of course, once a duty to act arises, if the action\nthat is decided upon constitutes administrative action,\nthe target of\nthe action will be entitled to rely upon the protection afforded by\nPAJA.\n[35]\tAppellantâs\ncounsel attached weight to a dictum of this Court in\nChairman,\nState Tender Board and Another v Supersonic Tours (Pty) Ltd\n[2008] ZASCA 56\n;\n2008\n(6) SA 220\n(SCA). In that case the State Tender Board resolved to\nrestrict the company and its directors from obtaining any business\nfrom an\norgan of state for a period of 10 years. It did so purporting\nto act pursuant to the powers conferred on an organ of state by reg\n15. Although the decision was an administrative act within the\nmeaning of PAJA\n24\nthe Court held that an âincorrectâ claim for preference does not,\nwithout more, permit reliance on reg 15(1) (and consequently,\nalso\nupon reg 15(2)). Cloete JA referred to the requirements of subreg (1)\nas âeither that the preference was obtained on a fraudulent\nbasis,\nor that there was non-attainment of specific goals in the performance\nof the contractâ.\n25\nCounsel tried to support his submission as to the need to\nestablish\nthe existence of a\nfraudulent preference on this weak foundation; weak because the\nlearned judge was only concerned to paraphrase\nthe requirement and\nwas not at all interested in spelling out the ambit of its operation.\n[36]\tI\nmust now give attention, brief as it may be, to the submission that\nthe City had not arrived at the stage of taking action\nbefore the\napplication was brought. Here too I agree with the reasoning and\nconclusions of Irish AJ quoted above. The City referred\nthe complaint\nto Tradeworld, a âverification agencyâ, because, according to Mr\nBindeman:\nâ\nIt\nis impossible for the City to keep abreast with all of the changes in\nshareholdings, shareholders agreements and actual flow of\nmoney\nbetwee n related companies. . .\nHowever,\nfor the purposes of investigating fronting practices, the\ninvestigations of [Viking] will go further than merely the\ninformation\non Tradeworldâs database.â\nUnfortunately,\nthe role and expertise of Tradeworld remained unexplained. No\naffidavit was filed on its behalf. The court\na\nquo\nwas left to guess as to\nhow the investigations would be carried beyond Tradeworldâs\ndatabase. In so far as the City relied on an\ninvestigation that had\nbeen initiated it was coy to the point of concealment as to the\ndetail. What is beyond dispute is that Mr\nBindeman, Head: Tenders for\nthe City, perplexed as to the means of proceeding, sloughed off its\nresponsibility and diverted Hidro-Techâs\nattorney to the Department\nof Trade and Industry, rather than take a meaningful decision.\n26\nMr Shnaps, Director: Supply Chain Management, for the City, notified\nViljoen in late February 2008 that âthe City is unable to\ntake any\naction against Tricom at this stageâ. When Bindeman deposed to his\naffidavit on 28 March, he stated, âThis is still\nthe positionâ.\nIt was clear, as the learned judge found, that the City had taken no\nrational step to address the complaint. There\nwas, therefore, no\ndecision taken by the City which the court\na\nquo\nneeded to set aside\nbefore making its own order. Since the allegation of fraudulent\nprocurement was serious, clear, particularised,\nsupported by cogent\nsworn statements and stood uncontradicted, only an official who was\nunreasonably cautious could have neglected\nto take appropriate\naction. The City was in breach of its duty from, at least, the time\nof receiving the affidavits of James and\nZandberg  on about 19\nFebruary.\n[37]\tI\nconclude that the court\na\nquo\ndid not err in granting\nthe relief it did. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.\n____________________\nJ\nA Heher\nJudge\nof Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT\nS:\tJ\nG Dickerson SC with him A M Smalberger\nInstructed\nby Rabie & Rabie, Cape Town;\nHoney\nAttorneys, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT\n:\tD\nC Joubert\nInstructed\nby Jaques Viljoen Attorneys, Cape Town;\nSymington\nDe Kock, Bloemfontein\n1\nGN 725 in GG 22549 of 10 August 2001.\n2\nReg 13(11), subject to certain exceptions not presently relevant,\n\tand reg 3(4) or 4(4) (depending on the Rand value of the\n\ttender/procurement).\n3\nReg 8(7).\n4\nReg 13(1).\n5\nReg 14.\n6\nBroad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 53 of 2003\n.\n7\nEmphasis in the original letter.\n8\nIn terms of an amendment effected at the commencement of the\n\thearing.

    "facts": "The dispute arose from a series of tenders issued by the City of Cape Town for water and sewerage treatment works. Hidro‑Tech repeatedly lost these tenders to Viking Pony Africa Pumps (trading as Tricom Africa) despite submitting lower prices. Hidro‑Tech alleged that Viking obtained preference points on a fraudulent basis through “fronting” – the appointment of historically disadvantaged individuals (HDIs) as token directors and shareholders while the real economic benefit flowed to a wholly white‑owned sister company, Bunker Hill Pumps (trading as Tricom Systems). Several letters and affidavits, including sworn statements from former directors, detailed alleged tokenism, unequal remuneration and the routing of profits to Bunker Hill. Hidro‑Tech claimed that the City, as an organ of state, had a statutory duty under regulation 15(1) of the Preferential Procurement Regulations to act against a contractor that obtained a preference fraudulently. The City’s response was limited to referring the matter to a data‑base manager, Quadrem Tradeworld, and it failed to undertake a substantive investigation.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the City of Cape Town, as an organ of state, was required to act against Viking and Bunker Hill upon receiving the complaint, i.e., whether the statutory duty under regulation 15(1) was triggered by a mere credible allegation of fraudulent preference. 2. How the term “detecting” in regulation 15(1) should be interpreted – whether it demands a full factual inquiry or a broader, proactive response to a reasonable suspicion. 3. Whether the City’s limited referral to a verification agency satisfied its duty to investigate and act.",
    "principles": "The court examined the purpose of regulation 15(1) within the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, emphasizing that the Minister intended a wide net for “detecting” fraud so that organs of state act proactively. The judgment relied on the principle that detection need not require a conclusive investigation; a credible complaint that raises a reasonable suspicion is sufficient to trigger the duty to act. Relevant authorities included the State Tender Board case (Chairman, State Tender Board v Supersonic Tours) which clarified that a fraudulent preference claim alone does not automatically invoke the punitive powers of regulation 15 but does impose a remedial duty. The court also noted that the heading “Penalties” does not limit the remedial nature of sub‑regulation (1).",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that the letters and affidavits submitted by Hidro‑Tech constituted a serious, specific, and uncontradicted allegation of fronting, thereby satisfying the “detecting” requirement. The City’s reliance on Quadrem Tradeworld and its failure to conduct a substantive investigation did not fulfil the statutory obligation. Consequently, the City was in breach of its duty under regulation 15(1) to act against the contractors. The appeal by Viking and Bunker Hill was therefore untenable, as the lower court’s order requiring the City to act against the respondents was proper.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal with costs. The order of the Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division, which required the City of Cape Town to act against Viking Pony Africa Pumps (t/a Tricom Africa) and Bunker Hill Pumps (t/a Tricom Systems) in accordance with regulation 15 of the Preferential Procurement Regulations, was upheld."
