The sentence\nimposed by the trial court is set aside and for it is substituted a\nsentence\nof\n12 (twelve) years imprisonment.\nJUDGMENT\nSeriti AJA\n(HEHER AND MALAN\nJJA concurring):\n[1]\tThe appellant appeared before the regional court,\nfacing one count of murder. After evidence was led he was convicted\nas charged\nand sentenced to fifteen yearsâ imprisonment. His appeal\nto the North Gauteng High Court against both conviction and sentence\nwas\nunsuccessful. He was granted leave to appeal to this court by\nMurphy J.\n[2]\tThe appeal revolves around two issues, namely\nwhether the appellant acted in self defence when he shot and caused\nthe death of\nthe deceased, Mr Robert Miller, and whether, when\nimposing the sentence, the trial court was correct when it found that\nthere were\nno substantial and compelling circumstances which\njustified the imposition of a sentence lesser than the sentence\nprescribed by\nsection 51(2)\nof the\nCriminal Law Amendment Act 105 of\n1997\n.\n[3]\tIt is common cause that on the day in question the\ndeceased and Messers Vernon Watson (âWatsonâ), Marcus Ruiters\n(âRuitersâ)\nand Barend Barnard (âBarnardâ) drank alcohol at a\ncertain place. In the evening, the deceased drove them in a Toyota\nCorolla,\nto a barbershop and parked their motor vehicle in a parking\nbay parallel with the pavement. In front of the motor vehicle there\nwas\na bakkie belonging to the appellant parked with its nose facing\nthe nose of the Corolla.\n[4]\tThe deceased and his friends (but as the trial court\ncorrectly found, not Watson who was left in the car) went to the pool\ntables\nadjoining the barbershop where they encountered the appellant\nand other people. An argument ensued between the appellant and the\ndeceased leading to a fight. The friends of the deceased joined in\nand assisted the deceased. The appellantâs friends also took\npart\nin helping him. In the process the appellant was assaulted and he\nsustained bodily injuries.\n[5]\tThe owner of the business premises, Mr Abdul Rocker\ncame on the scene and chased the deceased and his friends out. They\nwent to\ntheir motor vehicle. The deceased sat on the driverâs seat\nand Mr. Barnard on the passengerâs front seat together with two\nyoung\nchildren and Watson on the left back seat and Ruiters on the\nright.\n.\n[6]\tThe appellant was also chased from the premises. He\nwent to his bakkie and, whilst standing in front of it, fired five\nbullets\nat the motor vehicle in which the deceased and his friends\nwere sitting. At that stage the appellant was about three metres away\nfrom the deceasedâs motor vehicle. The gun shots hit that vehicle\non the bonnet, front windscreen and radiator. The deceased was\nstruck\nby one of the bullets and later died.\n[7]\tThe state witnesses Watson, Ruiters and Barnard\ntestified that when the appellant fired their vehicle was stationary,\nidling and\nnot in gear. Rocker said that when he went out of the\nbarbershop, just after the shooting, he found the deceasedâs\nCorolla idling.\n[8]\tThe appellant testified that when he left the\nbarbershop the deceased and his friends were standing on the\nsidewalk. They swore\nat him and threatened to run him over. His\nmother and young brother came on the scene, and his brother ran to\nhim and held him by\nhis leg. At that time, the four men were inside\ntheir motor vehicle. The driver of motor vehicle was revving it and\nit was jerking\nforward. He drew his firearm which was in a holster at\nhis side. He fired a shot at the motor vehicleâs engine. The motor\nvehicle\ncontinued coming towards him and he fired a second shot.\nThere was no positive response from the driver. The Corolla continued\ncoming\ntowards him. He then fired three more shots one after the\nother and the motor vehicle stopped.\n[9]\tThe trial court accepted the evidence of the state\nwitnesses on how the shooting occurred and rejected the version of\nthe appellant.\nIt accepted that there was no attempt to run over the\nappellant with a motor vehicle. The trial court further found that\nwhen the\nappellant fired he had the intention to kill the driver.\n[10]\tThe full court which heard the appeal, after\nanalysing the facts of the case, agreed with the trial court that the\nevidence of\nMessers Watson, Ruiters and Barnard was by and large\ncredible and reliable and that the probabilities supported their\nversion. The\ntrial court was aware of their intoxication and\napproached their testimony with caution. It noted contradictions in\nthe version of\nthe state witnesses but found them not to be material.\nIt rejected the appellantâs version and his defence on the grounds\nthat\nit was highly improbable.\n[11]\tThe appellantâs counsel submitted that the trial\ncourt should not have accepted the evidence of Messers Watson,\nRuiters and\nBarnard when they said that their motor vehicle was\nstationary when shot at. The submission was that the state witnesses\nhad a motive\nto tender false evidence against the appellant as their\nfriends was killed and they assaulted the appellant. There is no\nmerits in\nthis. In\nS v Morgan and others\n1\n;\nS v Tshoko\n2\nen ân ander; R v Dhlumayo\n3\nthe court reiterated the principle that an\nappeal court is generally reluctant to upset a trial courtâs\nfindings of fact and its\nassessment of the credibility of witnesses.\nI am unable to find any reason why the trial court should not have\naccepted the state\nwitnessesâ evidence. There was no objective\nevidence to suggest that they had a motive to give false evidence\nagainst the appellant.\n[12]\tThe appellantâs counsel further submitted that\nthe deceased could (involuntarily) have put the gears of the motor\nvehicle into\nneutral after being shot at. This submission is not\nbased on reliable evidence and amounts to speculation.\n[13]\tThe appellant testified that when the motor vehicle\njerked towards him he could not take evasive action because the\npavement\nnext to him was full of people and the road to his left was\nbusy with traffic. Later he changed his evidence and stated that he\ndid\nnot think about taking any evasive action to avoid being knocked\ndown by the motor vehicle. His evidence was correctly rejected by\nthe\ntrial court.\n[14]\tAppellantâs counsel further submitted that if it\nis found, objectively viewed, that the appellantâs life was not\nunder threat,\nthe appellant erroneously believed that it was in\ndanger and that he therefore acted in putative self defence. The\nsubmission was\nfurther made that the erroneous belief of the\nappellant excluded dolus and he should have been convicted of\nculpable homicide only.\n[15]\tThe submission by the appellantâs counsel is\nwithout merits. The trial court found, and I agree, that the\ndeceased's motor\nvehicle was stationary when the appellant fired at\nit. The appellant could not have reasonably believed that his life\nwas in danger\nâ See\nS v Joshua\n4\nand\nS v De Oliveira\n5\n.\nThe appellant fired directly at the front windscreen knowing that\nthere was a driver behind the steering wheel. His life was not\nthreatened. It follows that the appeal against his conviction should\nbe dismissed.\n[16]\tAs far as sentence is concerned\nsection 51(2)\nof\nthe Act read in conjunction with\nPart II\nof Schedule 2 provides that\nif an accused is convicted of murder, the court shall impose a\nminimum sentence of 15 years. Subsection\n(3) stipulates that the\ncourt may depart from the prescribed sentence and impose a sentence\nless than the prescribed sentence if\nthere are substantial and\ncompelling circumstances justifying the imposition of such a\nsentence.\n[17]\t When considering sentence, the trial court took\ninto account the personal circumstances of the appellant and the fact\nthat the\nappellant was a first offender. It also took into account\nnature and seriousness of the offence and the interests of society.\nThe\ntrial court further said that although the appellant was clearly\na victim of assault, it could not find sufficient factors justifying\nthe imposition of a lesser sentence.\n[18]\tAs a general rule, a court of appeal will not\ninterfere with the sentence imposed by the trial court unless the\ntrial court has\nfailed to exercise its discretion properly. This will\nbe the case if there was a misdirection on the part of the trial\ncourt â\nsee\nS v Shapiro\n6\n;\nS v Sadler\n7\nand\nS v Michele.\n8\n[19]\tIn passing sentence the magistrate accepted that\nthe appellant had been assaulted by the deceased and his friends. He,\nhowever,\ndid not consider that to be a substantial and compelling\ncircumstance justifying the imposition of a lesser sentence. He said\nthat,\ndespite the assault on him, the appellant had the choice of\nwithdrawing but instead went ahead and stood in front of the Corolla\nin order to provoke a further confrontation. The full court\nassociated itself with this view. To my mind, however, it is\nprecisely\ncircumstances such as the assault, the injuries he\nsustained and the anger which possessed him that palliate the horror\nof the appellantâs\ncrime and his moral culpability. Neither court\napparently attached weight to the combined effect of these factors.\nThat was, as I\nsee it, a material misdirection which entitles us to\nconsider the sentence afresh.\n[20]\tThe personal circumstances of the appellant, the\nfact that he was assaulted prior to he shooting and sustained\nphysical injuries\nand that he was angry at the time of the shooting\ncumulatively justifies the imposition of a sentence less than the\nprescribed sentence.\nIn my view, after taking into account all the\nrelevant factors into account, a sentence of twelve yearsâ\nimprisonment is appropriate.\n[21]\t (a)\t The appeal against conviction is dismissed.\n(b)\tThe appeal against sentence succeeds. The sentence\nis set aside and for it is substituted a sentence of 12 yearsâ\nimprisonment.\nw\nl seriti\nActing\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nFOR APPELLANT: \tM van Wyngaard\nInstructed by \tMatwadia Attorneys, Springs\nMpobole & Ismail Attorneys, Bloemfontein\nFOR RESPONDENT:\tJ J KotzÃ©\nInstructed by\tThe Director of Public Prosecutions,\nPretoria\n1\n1993 (2) SACR 134\n(A) at p153 a-c.\n2\n1988 (1) SA 139\n(AA) at 142\nI-\n143A.\n3\n1948 (2) SA 677\n(AD) at 689.\n4\n2003 (1) SACR 1(SCA)\nat para 29.\n5\n1993\n\t(2) SACR 59\n(A)\nat 63i-64a.\n6\n1994 (1) SACR112 (A) at 124d-e.\n7\n2000 (1) SACR 331\n(SCA) at 334d-g.\n8\n2010 (1) SACR 131\n(SCA) at para H.",

    "facts": "The appellant, Bruce‑Lee Lutchman Naidoo, was involved in an altercation with the deceased, Robert Miller, and Miller’s friends after they had been drinking. During the fight the appellant was assaulted and injured. Later, the appellant retrieved his firearm and, while standing about three metres from Miller’s stationary Toyota Corolla, fired five shots at the vehicle, striking the windscreen and killing Miller. State witnesses testified that the vehicle was idling and not moving; the appellant claimed he feared being run over and fired in self‑defence.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two primary issues: (1) whether the appellant acted in self‑defence—or putative self‑defence—when he shot the vehicle, and (2) whether the trial court erred in finding no substantial and compelling circumstances that would justify a sentence lower than the statutory minimum of fifteen years for murder under s 51(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997.",
    "principles": "The court considered the principles governing self‑defence, including the requirement of a reasonable belief of imminent danger (S v Joshua; S v De Oliveira). It noted that an appeal court is reluctant to disturb a trial court’s findings of fact unless there is a misdirection (S v Morgan; S v Tshoko). For sentencing, s 51(2) mandates a minimum fifteen‑year term for murder, but s 51(3) allows a departure where substantial and compelling circumstances exist. Relevant case law on sentencing discretion and misdirection includes S v Shapiro, S v Sadler, and S v Michele.",
    "application": "The court found the motor vehicle was stationary at the time of the shooting, making it unreasonable for the appellant to believe his life was in danger; consequently, self‑defence was rejected and the conviction upheld. Regarding sentencing, the court held that the trial court misdirected itself by not treating the appellant’s prior assault, injuries, and anger as substantial and compelling circumstances, thereby justifying a departure from the prescribed minimum sentence.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The appeal against sentence succeeded: the original fifteen‑year term was set aside and replaced with a twelve‑year imprisonment sentence."
