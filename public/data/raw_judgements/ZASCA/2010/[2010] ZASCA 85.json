The appellant (‘Delphisure’) is an\n\ninsurance brokerage that devised a crop insurance product known as\r\nFarmsure which was marketed by the third respondent (‘Bexsure’)\n\nfor the 2004 growing season.  Both the first and second respondents\r\napplied for Farmsure insurance, but it later transpired that\nno such\r\nproduct in fact existed as, despite all its efforts, Delphisure had\r\nnot succeeded in having it underwritten by an insurer.\nWhen their\r\ncrops failed, the first and second respondents instituted action in\r\nthe High Court, Cape Town against both Delphisure\nand Bexsure whom\r\nthey alleged had misrepresented that the Farmsure product was in\r\nplace, thereby causing them not to take out insurance\nwith another\r\ninsurer, Mutual and Federal Insurance Company Ltd (‘Mutual &\r\nFederal’), and claiming as damages the\namounts they would have\r\nbeen paid by Mutual & Federal if it had insured their crops. The\r\nclaim succeeded solely against Delphisure\n(the court a quo held that\r\nBexsure had not known that Farmsure did not exist at the material\r\ntime). With leave of the court a quo,\nit appeals to this court\r\nagainst that decision.\n[2]\t   Not only does Delphisure sell insurance on\r\nbehalf of insurance companies but it acts as an administrator of\r\ninsurance products\nsold to third parties and is an accredited agent\r\nof the international insurer Lloyds of London (‘Lloyds’)\r\non whose\nbehalf it has been mandated to market a range of short term\r\ninsurance policies. Farming in this country is an enterprise often\r\nafflicted by natural perils, and many farmers insure their crops\r\nagainst failure. In 2002 and 2003, Delphisure marketed a crop\r\ninsurance policy in the Northern Cape. Underwritten by Lloyds and\r\nissued by the Cape Insurance Company Ltd, this was a policy devised\n\nfor the benefit of the members of the Griqualand West Co-operative\r\nSociety. It generated considerable interest and Mr ‘Vango’\n\nKolovos, at the time Delphisure’s general manager, was\r\napproached by a representative of Bester Feed & Grain Exchange\n\n(Pty) Ltd, a substantial player in the grain industry in the Western\r\nCape that handled the wheat of several hundred wheat farmers,\nto\r\nascertain whether it would be possible to arrange a similar crop\r\ninsurance product for farmers in the Western Cape.\n[3]\t   Kolovos recognised crop insurance as being a\r\npotentially lucrative product, particularly in the Western Cape where\r\nwheat\nis produced on a large scale, and entered into negotiations\r\ninvolving the third respondent (‘Bexsure), a company in the\r\nsame\nstable as Bester Feed & Grain, as well of representatives of\r\nLloyds, to see if it would be possible to devise a suitable product.\n\nIn doing so, Kolovos attempted to devise an insurance model that\r\nwould satisfy Lloyds’ requirements to underwrite the product.\n\nCrucial to its acceptance were what Kolovos described as the\r\nnecessary demographics, which included the geographical situation\nof\r\nthe farms to be insured, the likely quantities of wheat to be\r\nproduced and insured, and the anticipated value of the insured\nrisk.\r\nIt was of importance to Lloyds for the risk to be spread, and\r\nconsequently any model in which most of the farmers taking\ninsurance\r\nwere from the same district was regarded as undesirable as a\r\nlocalised crop failure in that district could hold disastrous\n\nconsequences for an insurance underwriter.\n[4]\t   In addition, in order to provide a new product\r\nlikely to sell, Kolovos had to come up with a model that had\r\nadvantages over\nthe products of competitors already in the market. In\r\nthis regard, other insurers offered cover for no more than 65 per\r\ncent of\na farmer’s anticipated crop and did not offer so-called\r\n‘emergence cover’ which insured farmers in the event of\n\ntheir crops not germinating and emerging from the ground. Indeed, the\r\nother cover available was conditional upon a certificate\nof emergence\r\nbeing issued once sufficient germination and emergence had taken\r\nplace. Kolovos decided to better this in his model\nby providing for a\r\nproduct allowing a farmer an election to take up to 100 per cent crop\r\ncover and also to include emergence cover\n(the attraction of the\r\nlatter being that if germination did not take place the farmers would\r\nstill receive compensation for their\nproduction costs in preparing\r\nthe soil and planting).\n[5]\t   All of this required ongoing consultations and\r\nnegotiations. In a letter addressed to Kolovos on 25 February 2003,\r\nthe financial\ndirector of Bexsure, after providing certain\r\ninformation relevant to a potential insurance product, concluded ‘\r\n. . . we\nneed to be assured that you will be able to supply us with a\r\nproduct as described with the necessary underwriting and legal\r\nrequirements\nbeing met’. Kolovos responded by expressing the\r\nopinion that Bexsure’s requirements were achievable but that it\r\nwould\nbe necessary to provide an extremely detailed presentation to\r\ninsurers in London to obtain approval.\n[6]\t   It soon became clear that it was too late to\r\narrange any insurance for the 2003 season and it was decided to\r\nattempt to do\nso in the following year. Consultations continued,\r\nduring which Lloyds stated that the policy should use the terms of\r\npolicies\nthat were tried and tested. This led to the policy wording\r\nof Mutual & Federal’s crop insurance being used, adapted to\n\nprovide for both a choice of up to 100 per cent crop cover as well as\r\nemergence insurance. In addition, a schedule of premium rates\nwas\r\nprepared and the product was given the name ‘Farmsure’.\r\nThe suggestion by Kolovos of a condition that at least\nhalf the\r\nfarmers in each co-operative should take the cover was regarded by\r\nBexsure as impractical, as Kolovos ultimately conceded.\nBut despite\r\nall of this, Lloyds did not give Kolovos its unconditional support,\r\nand still needed to be persuaded by the demographics\nbefore agreeing\r\nto underwrite the product.\n[7]\t   Rumours about a new crop insurance product to be\r\nmarketed by Bexsure began to do the rounds in the farming community\r\nof the\nWestern Cape as the 2004 growing season approached. As a\r\nresult, and as it was the intention for Farmsure to be marketed\r\nthrough\nfarmers’ co-operatives who would collect the premiums\r\nfrom their members by debiting their accounts, Bexsure arranged a\r\nmeeting\nin Stellenbosch on 21 April 2004 to which it invited\r\nrepresentatives of a number of  co-operatives, including Mr Danie\r\nGouws, an\ninsurance consultant who was at the time employed by the\r\nco-operative known as Boland Agri. In addition, a number of private\r\ninsurance\nbrokers also attended, including Mr Le Roux van Wyk, who\r\nhad persuaded Lizelle Scott (a director of Bexsure who was primarily\r\ninvolved\nin the marketing of Farmsure) to allow him to attend as he\r\nhad a number of farming clients who were interested in the rumoured\r\nnew crop insurance product.\n[8]\t   The meeting was addressed by Kolovos who, when he\r\nlater testified, attempted to persuade the court a quo that he had\r\nexplained\nthat Farmsure was not yet in existence but was conditional\r\nupon acceptance by Lloyds, and that such acceptance was in turn\r\nconditional\nupon the demographics of the model being met by the\r\nnumber of sales, the amount of insurance that was taken up, the\r\naverage percentage\nof the crops insured and the geographical spread\r\nof the farmers who purchased the product. As against this allegation,\r\nthe weight\nof the evidence led from the witnesses Scott, Van Wyk and\r\nGouws, was that Kolovos formally announced the Farmsure product,\r\nstated\nthat it was fully underwritten by Lloyds and stressed its\r\nadvantages by providing emergence cover and a choice of insurance for\n\nup to 100 per cent of the crop. In the light of the weight of this\r\nevidence and the inherent probabilities, the court below correctly\n\nfound that Kolovos’s evidence on this score could not be\r\naccepted and that he had indeed created the impression that the\n\nFarmsure product was available and was underwritten by Lloyds.\n[9]\t   Presumably Kolovos did not make it plain that\r\nLloyds had not yet approved the Farmsure policy as it would have been\r\nimpossible\nto market non-existent insurance. However, he did ask the\r\nco-operatives to complete questionnaires in order to ascertain how\r\nmany\nmembers in each co-operative were likely to insure their wheat\r\ncrops during the forthcoming season, what premiums were likely to\nbe\r\ngenerated, and the anticipated quantity of wheat likely to be\r\ninsured. These completed questionnaires were returned to him within\na\r\nday. As time was of the essence (farmers were due to begin planting\r\nwithin a few weeks and it had been agreed that the final\ncut-off date\r\nfor Farmsure applications would be 10 May 2004) on 26 April 2004,\r\nKolovos telefaxed the following letter to Bexsure:\n‘\nThis serves to confirm\r\nand indicate the parameters of the anticipated insurance.\nAs per the attached, being the\r\n\tminimum figures for crop per each Co-op and the minimum in total to\r\n\thave a successful crop model.\nAcceptance by Lloyds of London\r\n\tof the exclusion of the 50% ruling as indicated by your motivational\r\n\tletter.\nPremiums to be paid by the\r\n\tCo-op or the farmers by no later than the end of the month of the\r\n\teffective date of the crop policy.\nAll policies to be written by\r\n\tno later than 10 May 2004.\nBased on the presales figures,\r\n\ta final decision of acceptance will be made by the underwriter.\nThe crop certificates are in the\r\nprocess of being created and will be available by Wednesday 28\r\nApril.’\n[10]\nThe\r\nschedule attached to this letter contained a synopsis of the\r\ninformation contained in the completed questionnaires, including\n\ndetails of the geographical areas in which the farmers who were\r\nlikely to purchase Farmsure conducted their farming operations\nand\r\nthe anticipated quantity of the crops that would be insured. Scott\r\ntestified that on receipt of this letter she was both anxious\nand\r\nconfused as she wanted urgently to start marketing the product and\r\nhad understood Kolovos at the Stellenbosch meeting to say\nthat it was\r\nin place. She therefore contacted him, and he advised her that\r\neverything was in fact in order but that she should\nnot start\r\nmarketing until he provided the necessary documentation. To that end,\r\na Bexsure logo was e-mailed to Delphisure for incorporation\nonto\r\napplication forms. These documents, once so prepared, were generated\r\nby Delphisure’s computer system and made available\nto Bexsure.\n[11]\t    On 28 April 2004, Kolovos gave Scott the\r\ngo-ahead to market Farmsure. As part of her marketing strategy, she\r\narranged a\nmeeting on 5 May 2004 at the Winkelshoek building at\r\nPiketberg, commonly known as the ’Rietdak’. This meeting\r\nwas attended\nby a number of farmers, including the first and second\r\nrespondents, both of whom had already applied to Mutual & Federal\r\nfor\ncrop insurance for the season. The application of the first\r\nrespondent had already been accepted, although it was conditional\r\nupon\nthe issue of an emergence certificate, while that of the second\r\nrespondent was subject to approval after an inspection of his farm\n\nhad been conducted (an issue to which I shall return in due course).\r\nHowever, both had been so intrigued by the rumours of the\nFarmsure\r\nproduct that they had arranged for their insurance broker, Van Wyk,\r\nto obtain quotations of the anticipated cost of premiums\nfrom Bexsure\r\non their behalf.\n[12]\t    At the meeting, Scott gave details of what\r\nFarmsure offered, explained that the cut-off date for applications\r\nwas 10 May\n2004 and informed those present that the product was in\r\nexistence and was fully underwritten by Lloyds. The first and second\r\nrespondents\nfound the product to be so attractive that, immediately\r\nafter the meeting, they both contacted their broker, Van Wyk, through\r\nwhom\nthey had placed their applications for crop insurance for the\r\nseason with Mutual & Federal, and asked him to see if he could\n\narrange for those applications to be withdrawn or cancelled. Van Wyk\r\nwent ahead and succeeded in doing so. Meanwhile the first\nand second\r\nrespondents applied to Bexsure for Farmsure insurance for the 2004\r\nseason.\n[13]\t    Unfortunately for all concerned, the sales of\r\nFarmsure for various reasons failed to meet the demographic\r\nrequirements\nof Lloyds. Despite meetings and negotiations being held\r\nwith various farmers and other interested parties, and attempts being\r\nmade\nto attract underwriting from other quarters, none of which is\r\nnecessary to detail for purposes of this judgment, it proved\r\nimpossible\nto obtain underwriting for Farmsure which therefore never\r\nsaw the light of day. While this was going on, the crops planted by\r\nthe\nfirst and second respondents germinated but, despite their\r\ninitial promise, ultimately failed due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nAs the first and second respondents were left uninsured due to the\r\nFarmsure policies for which they had applied having been still-born\n\nand their Mutual & Federal applications having been cancelled,\r\nthey were understandably aggrieved. And so, in due course, they\n\ninstituted action claiming the amounts they alleged they would have\r\nrecovered from Mutual & Federal had they not cancelled\ntheir\r\napplications on the strength of Scott’s misrepresentation at\r\nthe Rietdak meeting that the Farmsure cover was in place\nand fully\r\nunderwritten by Lloyds.\n[14]\t   It is convenient at this stage to consider\r\nDelphisure’s contention that Scott knew at the time of the\r\nRietdak meeting\nthat the Farmsure product was not finally in place\r\nand was dependent upon the demographics obtained from the sales of\r\nthe product\nbeing sufficient to\npersuade Lloyds\r\nto accept the model – it being its contention either that it\r\ncould not be held responsible for Scott’s\nfailure to inform the\r\nmeeting of the true state of affairs, alternatively, that even if it\r\nwas responsible, Scott was a joint wrongdoer\nwhose actions rendered\r\nBexsure jointly and severally liable with it to the first and second\r\nrespondents.\n[15]\t   Scott denied that she was aware that Farmsure\r\nstill had to be accepted by Lloyds at the time and testified that\r\nKolovos\nhad brought her under the impression that everything was in\r\norder. It was argued by  Delphisure that she could not be believed,\n\nparticularly in the light of the fifth point in the letter of 26\r\nApril 2004 in which it was stated that a final decision on acceptance\n\nwould be made by the underwriter based on the ‘pre-sales\r\nfigures’ which, so it contended, were the figures which would\n\nbe forthcoming after the policy had been marketed. This cannot be so.\r\nNot only would it be a contradiction in terms to refer to\nthe figures\r\nof actual sales as a ‘pre-sales figures’ but, bearing in\r\nmind that the schedule attached to the letter\ncontained an analysis\r\nof anticipated sales derived from the questionnaires which had been\r\ncompleted, the reference therein to pre-sales\nfigures could only have\r\nmeant those figures set out in the schedule. Accordingly, the letter\r\nmeant only one thing, namely, that\nDelphisure was awaiting a final\r\ndecision by the underwriter (Lloyds) to be taken on strength of the\r\ninformation set out in the\nschedule.  Accordingly, when Kolovos later\r\ntold Scott everything was in order and subsequently, on 28 April\r\n2004, gave her the\ngreen light to go ahead to market Farmsure, she\r\nwas entitled to think that on the strength of pre-sales figures\r\nattached to the\nschedule to the letter of 2 April, Lloyds had agreed\r\nto underwrite the product. In any event, Scott was not likely to go\r\nout and\nmarket a product which to her knowledge did not exist, and\r\nthe probabilities are overwhelming that she only did so as she was\r\nunder\nthe impression that since 26 April Lloyds’ requirements\r\nhad been met and that it had agreed to underwrite the product. The\n\nargument that Scott was thus aware at the Rietdak meeting on 5 May\r\nthat the Farmsure product was not in place cannot be sustained.\n[16]\t   This conclusion is relevant to the question of\r\nnegligence, an issue to which I now turn, the test for which is so\r\nwell known\nthat it need not be repeated. In considering the question\r\nof negligence, it is necessary to consider the foreseeability of\r\nharm,\nan issue which is also relevant to the question of legal\r\ncausation as I shall mention in due course.\n[17]\t   In regard to foreseeability, a reasonable person\r\nin Kolovos’ position when he instructed Scott to commence her\r\nmarketing\noperations would have appreciated that she would be under\r\nthe false impression that Lloyds had agreed to underwrite Farmsure\r\nand\nthat, in marketing the product, she would represent that it was\r\navailable and underwritten by Lloyds. Indeed that would be a major\n\nmarketing tool, and he therefore caused Scott to go out into the\r\nfarming community to spread false information in order to sell\ncrop\r\ninsurance in the hope that the sales which were forthcoming would\r\npersuade Lloyds to agree to underwrite the product.\n[18]\t   In order to avoid the obvious consequences\r\nflowing from such conduct, counsel for Delphisure argued that it had\r\nnot been\nreasonably foreseeable at the time that any farmer who\r\napplied for Farmsure cover would suffer a loss in the event of Lloyds\r\nultimately\ndeclining to underwrite the product.  This contention was\r\nbased on the fact that no other crop insurance was available as all\r\nother\ninsurers had already closed their applications for the 2004\r\nseason. Accordingly, so it was argued, the only farmers who it could\n\nbe foreseen might apply for Farmsure cover were those who would not\r\nhave been insured against crop failure in any event, and that\na\r\nreasonable person would not have foreseen that farmers who had\r\nalready applied for insurance cover would cancel or withdraw their\n\napplications in respect of that cover – or, at the very least,\r\nwould only have foreseen that those who had already applied\nfor\r\ninsurance would only cancel such applications once they had applied\r\nfor and been granted Farmsure insurance.   Consequently,\nso the\r\nargument went, the loss suffered by the first and second respondents,\r\nwho had withdrawn their applications for crop cover\nfrom Mutual &\r\nFederal and who were left without cover when the Farmsure product was\r\nstillborn, was not reasonably foreseeable\n[19]\t   These contentions, too, must be rejected.\r\nFarmsure’s selling point was that it was a product superior to\r\nthe other\ncrop insurance then available, offering both crop cover of\r\nup to 100 per cent and emergence cover – both of which were not\n\nelsewhere available. A reasonable person would therefore have\r\nrealized that farmers who had already applied for crop insurance\nfrom\r\ncompetitors such as Mutual & Federal might seek to resile\r\ntherefrom and apply for Farmsure insurance instead. The likelihood\nof\r\nsuch action was all the more real in the light of, first, the\r\nconsiderable interest and enthusiasm that Farmsure had generated\nin\r\nthe farming community as had become apparent at the meeting at\r\nStellenbosch on 24 April 2004, secondly, that even though the\ncut–off\r\ndate for other insurances had passed such applications might not yet\r\nhave been accepted (as was indeed the case with\nthe application of\r\nthe second respondent) and, thirdly, that even if such applications\r\nfor other insurance products had been accepted,\nthe insurance would\r\nstill be conditional upon the issue of a certificate of emergence\r\nafter germination of the crop, and that it\nwas only at that stage\r\nthat farmers who had applied for such insurance would be obliged to\r\npay their premiums. As planting for\nthe 2004 season was still to take\r\nplace, the issue of emergence certificates and the obligation to pay\r\npremiums were still a long\nway off and, in these circumstances, a\r\nreasonable person in Kolovos’s postion would have foreseen that\r\nfarmers who had already\napplied for crop insurance for the 2004\r\nseason, on hearing of the considerable advantages of the Farmsure\r\nproduct, might well decide\nto cancel their applications for other\r\ninsurance before they had to pay their premiums and, instead, apply\r\nfor a Farmsure policy\n– and that in doing so they would not\r\nnecessarily wait to see if their Farmsure applications were\r\nsuccessful. After all,\nthey would have no reason to think that those\r\nbehind a new product would not wish to accommodate as much business\r\nas possible and\nreject their applications. Nor would they wish to run\r\nthe risk of becoming obliged to pay crop insurance premiums to two\r\ndifferent\ninsurers. It was thus clearly foreseeable that farmers\r\nmight well cancel their applications for crop cover that were still\r\npending\nand, in that event, they would be left without crop insurance\r\nfor the 2004 season should Lloyds decline to underwrite Farmsure and\n\nwould suffer financial loss if their crops were to fail.  The loss\r\nsuffered by the first and second respondents was therefore reasonably\n\nforeseeable.\n[20]\t   Also relevant to the\r\nquestion of negligence is whether steps could have been taken to\r\nguard against the loss. It was a simple\nmatter for Kolovos to have\r\ndone so.  All that was required of him was to tell the truth,\r\nsomething which would in any event have\nbeen expected from an honest\r\ninsurance broker. Had he not misrepresented to Scott that the\r\nFarmsure product was fully underwritten\nby Lloyds when he instructed\r\nher to go out to market it, she would not have brought the first and\r\nsecond respondents under the\nimpression that the Farmsure product was\r\navailable. Although, as Kolovos emphasised, the Farmsure application\r\nform proclaimed that\nthe insurance would only become effective upon\r\nacceptance of the application, that is a standard term in all\r\napplications for insurance.\nAnd there is a considerable difference\r\nbetween representing, on the one hand, that an insurance policy\r\nexists but that an application\nhas to be accepted before it becomes\r\neffective and, on the other, that an insurance policy does not exist\r\nand may only come into\nexistence should the underwriter in the future\r\nagree to act as insurer. The standard terms of the policy if anything\r\nadded to the\nmisrepresentation of the existence of the product.\n[21]\t   Kolovos in fact took no steps\r\nto guard against the clearly foreseeable harm which might be suffered\r\nby persons in the position\nof the first and second respondents in the\r\nevent of them being enticed into applying for Farmsure cover. In\r\nthese circumstances,\nnegligence on the part of Kolovos was clearly\r\nestablished, and the fact that Scott was the person who made the\r\nactual misrepresentation\nto the first and second respondents in\r\nmarketing the policy on his instructions does not entitle Delphisure\r\nto escape responsibility.\n1\n[22]\t   At the same time,\r\nDelphisure’s argument that Scott was also negligent can be\r\nrejected. As I have said, there was no\nreason for her to have\r\nsuspected that the Farmsure product had not been approved by Lloyds\r\nand she was clearly under the impression\nthat the necessary\r\nunderwriting was in place. That misunderstanding was a reasonable\r\none, and I am not persuaded that the court\na quo in any way erred in\r\nfinding that Scott had not acted negligently in misrepresenting the\r\nposition to the first and second\nrespondents. Its finding in that\r\nregard must stand.\n[23]\t   I turn now to consider the\r\nquestion of the wrongfulness of Kolovos’s misrepresentation.\r\nWhere a claim is for pure\neconomic loss,\n2\neven if the conduct causing such loss is negligent, it will only be\r\nregarded as unlawful and therefore actionable if there are\npublic or\r\nlegal policy considerations which require liability to follow for the\r\ndamage it caused.\n3\n[24]\t   As has been correctly\r\nobserved, it is something of an understatement to say that liability\r\nalways depends on the facts of\neach given case as there are certain\r\ncategories of cases in which liability will almost indubitably\r\nfollow.\n4\nBut each case must be considered on its own merits and there is no\r\nsimple litmus test that can be applied to determine whether\nin all\r\ncases liability should follow. Despite that, in\nFourway\r\nHaulage SA (Pty) Ltd v SA National Roads Ltd\n5\nBrand JA expressed the view that our law has moved beyond the stage\r\nwhere liability will be dependent upon the ‘idiosyncratic\nviews\r\nof the individual judge as to what is reasonable and fair’, and\r\nechoed the words of Nugent JA in\nMinister\r\nof Safety and Security v Van Duivenboden\n6\nthat ‘what is called for is not an intuitive reaction to a\r\ncollection of arbitrary factors but rather a balancing against\none\r\nanother of identifiable norms’. To that may be added that such\r\na process involving criteria to which recognition has\nbeen given in\r\nthe past as either favouring or operating against the recognition of\r\nliability will advance the cause of certainty\nin judicial decisions,\r\na result to which it is always necessary to strive.\n[25]\t   Bearing that in mind, I turn\r\nto considerations of policy which are relevant. One important factor\r\nis of course the fear\nof so called ‘boundless liability’\r\nand an appreciation that the law will recognise liability more\r\nreadily where there\nis not a limitless number of claimants likely to\r\nbring a multiplicity  of actions.\n7\nGleaned from previous decisions, important considerations to which\r\nregard may be had are the following (the list is not intended\nto be\r\nexhaustive):\nWhether the plaintiff was vulnerable to the risk (which\r\n\twould favour a finding of liability) or could have avoided it by\r\n\tcontractual\nmeans such as a disclaimer (which would operate against\r\n\tliability);\nWhether the extension of liability would impose an\r\n\tunwarranted burden on a defendant or, conversely, whether it would\r\n\tnot unreasonably\ninterfere with the defendant’s commercial\r\n\tactivities as the defendant was already under a duty to take\r\n\treasonable care\nin respect of third parties;\nThe nature of the relationship between the parties,\r\n\tcontractual or otherwise;\nWhether the relationship between the parties was one of\r\n\t‘proximity’ or closeness;\nWhether the statement was made in the course of a\r\n\tbusiness context or in providing a professional service ;\nThe professional standing of the maker of the\r\n\tstatement;\nThe extent to which the plaintiff was dependant upon\r\n\tthe defendant for information and advice;\nThe reasonableness of the plaintiff relying on the\r\n\taccuracy of the statement.\n[26]\t   In considering these factors,\r\nit is of considerable importance that this is not a case in which\r\nthere is likely to be boundless\nliability involving an unlimited\r\nnumber of claimants. The misrepresentation was made to a limited\r\nclass, being the farmers to whom\nFarmsure was offered. Counsel for\r\nDelphisure also correctly conceded that this was not a case in which\r\nthe risk could have been\navoided by contractual means or in which the\r\nextension of liability would impose an unwarranted burden upon\r\nDelphisure. It is also\nrelevant that Kolovos knew that the\r\nrepresentation that Lloyds had underwritten the Farmsure product was\r\nof great importance in\npersuading farmers to purchase it, and his\r\nmisrepresentation in that regard was made in the course of his\r\nbusiness by a man of\nsubstantial professional standing to parties who\r\nwere vulnerable to the risk and were dependant upon him for the\r\naccuracy of the\ninformation.\n[27]\t   In the light of all the\r\nfeatures that I have just mentioned, this is a clear case in which\r\nconsiderations of policy should\nimpose liability for the negligent\r\nmisrepresentation if it caused the loss suffered by the first and\r\nsecond respondents.\n[28]\t   Having determined the issue\r\nof wrongfulness against Delphisure, it becomes necessary to consider\r\nthe issue of causation.\nThis involves two distinct enquiries: first,\r\nthe application of the so-called ‘but-for’ test in order\r\nto determine\nwhether the particular action concerned can be\r\nidentified as the cause without which the loss in question would not\r\nhave been suffered;\n8\nthe second being the question of legal causation, sometimes referred\r\nto as remoteness of damage,\n9\nbeing whether the wrongful act is sufficiently closely linked to the\r\nloss to attract legal liability. The latter enquiry is also\n\ndetermined by considerations of policy but, although there may be an\r\noverlapping with the factors to be taken into account, wrongfulness\n\nshould not be confused with legal causation or remoteness: and\r\nconduct which may be regarded as wrongful may well also be too remote\n\nfor liability to follow.\n10\n[29]\t   It was common cause on appeal that both factual\r\nand legal causation had been established in respect of the claim of\r\nthe\nfirst respondent who, had he not withdrawn his application for\r\ninsurance with Mutual & Federal after Scott’s promotion\nat\r\nthe Rietdak meeting on 5 May 2004, would have insured his crop with\r\nMutual & Federal and been paid compensation when it\nfailed. In\r\nthese circumstances, it was correctly common cause that the loss\r\nsuffered by the first respondent was a direct result\nof the\r\nmisrepresentation and sufficiently closely linked to the\r\nmisrepresentation to attract legal liability.\n[30]\t   On the other hand, the issue of factual\r\ncausation in respect of the second respondent’s claim is not as\r\nstraight-forward.\nIt was contended that the second respondent had not\r\nshown that but for Scott’s presentation at the Rietdak meeting\r\nhis loss\nwould not have been suffered. The argument in this regard\r\nwas twofold. First, it was argued that even had the misrepresentation\n\nrelating to Farmsure not been made, the second respondent would in\r\nany event have cancelled his application to Mutual & Federal\nand\r\nwould thus have been uninsured during the forthcoming growing season.\r\n Secondly, it was argued that even if the second respondent\nhad been\r\ninsured by Mutual & Federal, it would in all probability have\r\nrefused to pay him compensation under the policy due\nto\r\nmisrepresentations he had made in his application form.\n[31]\t   Before Mutual & Federal would accept the\r\nsecond respondent’s application for insurance cover, it was\r\nnecessary\nfor his farm to be inspected to verify that it was likely\r\nto produce the anticipated yield reflected in the application.\r\nAlthough\nthis was really nothing more than a formality according to\r\nthe witness Mr E D Rabie, who admired the second respondent as a\r\nfarmer\nand in whose hands the decision on acceptance lay, it led to\r\nMr Lou Robertson, an agricultural insurance assessor, being delegated\n\nby Janie Louw Brokers to visit the second respondent’s farm.\r\nThis he did on 3 May 2004. Unfortunately for him, he arrived\nwithout\r\nhaving made an appointment and incurred the ire of the second\r\nrespondent for failing to do so. However, the second respondent\n\ninvited him into his office where they discussed the provisions of\r\nMutual & Federal’s policy. It immediately became apparent\n\nthat the second respondent had a problem with the policy being\r\nconditional upon satisfactory emergence of the crop. Robertson\r\ntelephoned the offices of Janie Louw Brokers and obtained\r\nconfirmation that the insurance was indeed conditional upon\r\nacceptable\nemergence after germination, that the policy did not\r\ninclude emergence cover and that, consequently, pre-emergence input\r\ncosts\nwould not be covered. According to Robertson, when the second\r\nrespondent heard this he said he would not take the cover. Robertson\n\nthen left the farm without doing the necessary inspection.\n[32]\t   There is no reason not to accept Robertson’s\r\nevidence in this regard, his testimony having been corroborated by\r\nthe\ncontent of a contemporaneous note he made shortly after the\r\nincident. The second respondent’s evidence in this regard was\n\nmost unsatisfactory. He stated that he could not recall the\r\nconversation but that emergence cover was of no real consequence to\n\nhim as germination was never a problem in the district in which he\r\nfarmed. However, he appears to have attempted to downplay the\n\nimportance of emergence cover as, shortly after Robertson had left\r\nthe farm, he telephoned his insurance broker, Van Wyk, who had\nsent\r\nRobertson to inspect the farm. According to Van Wyk, although the\r\nsecond respondent complained about Roberson having arrived\nat his\r\nfarm without having arranged to do so, they also discussed the\r\nprovisions of Mutual & Federal’s policy and whether\nit\r\nprovided for emergence cover (which provides support for Robertson’s\r\nversion). Their conversation appears to have become\nheated and,\r\naccordingy to Van Wyk, he told the second respondent to keep his\r\nMutual & Federal application ‘on the table’\n–\r\nfrom which it must be inferred that the second respondent had said\r\nthat he wished to withdraw it – until there was\ncertainty over\r\nwhat Farmsure would offer. It was only on 5 May 2004, after the\r\npresentation by Scott at the Rietdak meeting, that\nthe second\r\nrespondent telephoned and instructed him to cancel his Mutual &\r\nFederal application.\n[33]\t   There is no reason to reject Robertson and Van\r\nWyk, whose evidence on this issue, supported as it is by Robertson’s\n\ncontemporaneous note, is far more compelling than that of the second\r\nrespondent.  It is clear from this that emergence cover was\nof\r\nimportance to the second respondent. Not only did he tell Robertson\r\nthat he did not want Mutual & Federal’s policy\nas it lacked\r\nemergence cover but he refused to allow him to carry out his\r\ninspection while knowing it was necessary for his application\nto be\r\napproved. Although this may in part have been due to his anger at\r\nRobertson’s unannounced arrival, he subsequently\ntold Van Wyk\r\nthat he did not want to proceed with his application. In these\r\ncircumstances the fact that Van Wyk persuaded him not\nto withdraw his\r\napplication until he had found out more about the Farmsure product so\r\nthat he could make an informed decision,\ndoes not indicate a fixed\r\nintention to persist with his application should Farmsure not prove\r\nto be more attractive.\n[34]  In order to succeed, the second respondent must\r\nshow that even if there had been no talk of the Farmsure product, he\r\nwould\nhave insured his crop with Mutual & Federal. Van Wyk\r\npersuaded the second respondent not to immediately withdraw his\r\napplication\nto Mutual & Federal only because he believed the\r\nFarmsure product existed. There is nothing to show that he would have\r\npersuaded\nthe second respondent not to withdraw his Mutual &\r\nFederal application if there had been no talk of Farmsure, and at no\r\nstage\ndid the second respondent testify that he would have elected to\r\npersist with his application had the Farmsure option not been offered\n\nto him. In the light of the evidence of Robertson and Van Wyk, his\r\ndenial that he had said that he did not want Mutual & Federal’s\n\ninsurance was clearly false. But in the light of his denial, he could\r\nhardly have testified that he would have changed his mind\nhad he\r\nknown the true state of affairs in regard to the Farmsure product,\r\nand there is no acceptable evidence that justifies such\na conclusion.\n[35]   The second respondent has therefore failed to\r\nshow that but for the misrepresentation that was made by Kolovos he\r\nwould have\nbeen insured by Mutual & Federal. That being so, he\r\nfailed to establish the necessary element of causation and his claim\r\nought\nto have been dismissed. The appeal in respect of his claim must\r\nbe upheld.\n[36]\t   Consequently, Delphisure is liable to the first\r\nrespondent for whatever damages he suffered as a result of Kolovos’\n\nnegligent misrepresentation that led to him not being able to recover\r\ncompensation from Mutual & Federal when his crop failed.\nThe\r\nquantum of his damages is agreed, being the sum he was awarded in the\r\ncourt a quo, and the appeal in respect of his claim must\naccordingly\r\nfail. However, the appeal in respect of the second respondent’s\r\nclaim must be upheld as he failed to prove that\nthe appellant’s\r\nmisrepresentation caused him to suffer loss. In the light of this\r\nconclusion, only paragraph 3 of the order\nof the court a quo which\r\ndealt with the second respondent’s claim needs to be altered.\n[37]   The general rule is for costs to follow the\r\nevent. The present matter is made more complicated by Delphisure\r\nhaving failed\nin respect of the claim of one plaintiff but succeeded\r\nin respect of the claim of the other. In these circumstances it would\r\nbe\nunfair to burden the unsuccessful plaintiff (the second\r\nrespondent) with all of Delphisure’s costs. An examination of\r\nthe\nrecord shows that about 30 per cent of the duration of the trial\r\nrelated solely to the claim of the second respondent. In addition,\n\nthe second respondent was one of three respondents in the appeal, and\r\nthe only one that was unsuccessful. In these circumstances\nI think it\r\nis fair to all to order the second respondent to pay 30 per cent of\r\nDelphisure’s costs in both the trial and the\nappeal.\n[38]   Two other issues must be briefly mentioned in\r\nregard to costs. First, Delphisure contended in its heads of argument\r\nthat\nif it was to be held liable so, too, should Bexsure as a result\r\nof Scott’s negligence. In response, Bexsure contended in its\n\nheads that it could not be held liable at this stage as Delphisure\r\nhad not served a notice on it under rule 13(8) and there was\nno lis\r\nbetween them as defendants.  This gave rise to Delphisure bringing a\r\nconditional application for leave to serve a notice\nunder rule 13(8)\r\nshould Bexsure’s contentions be upheld. There is no merit in\r\nBexsure’s argument and its counsel, wisely,\nabandoned the point\r\nduring the appeal.  In any event, in the light of the finding that\r\nScott had not been negligent, the issue\nis academic and I mention it\r\nonly in order to record that we were informed by counsel for the\r\nparties that no costs order relating\nto this application would be\r\nsought. Secondly, certain parties employed two counsel, and the costs\r\nattendant upon doing so are\njustifiable.\n[40]\t   It is therefore ordered:\nThe appellant’s appeal in respect of the claim of\r\n\tthe first respondent is dismissed.\nThe appeal in respect of the claim of the second\r\n\trespondent is upheld, and para 3 of the order of the court a quo is\r\n\tset aside\nand substituted with the following:\n‘\nThe second plaintiff’s\r\nclaim against the second defendant is dismissed, and the second\r\nplaintiff is to pay 30 per cent of\nthe second defendant’s\r\ncosts.\n’\nThe appellant is to pay the first and third\r\n\trespondent’s costs of appeal, such costs to include the costs\r\n\tof two counsel\nwhere so employed.\nThe second respondent is to pay 30 per cent of the\r\n\tappellant’s costs of appeal, such costs to include the costs\r\n\tof two counsel.\n___________________\nL E LEACH\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT:\t\t\tD Mitchell SC (with him A Kantor)\nInstructed by\nEdward Nathan Sonnenbergs, Cape Town\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nFIRST AND SECOND:\t\tN Treurnicht SC (with him H du Toit)\nRESPONDENT                            \tInstructed by\r\nWerksman, Tyger Valley\nMcIntyre & Van der Post, Bloemfontein\nTHIRD RESPONDENT:\t\tR S van Riet SC\nInstructed by\nRufus Dercksen & Partners, Stellenbosch\nHoney Attorneys Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nRuto Flour Mills (Pty) Ltd v Moriates &\r\n\tanother\n1957 (3) SA 113\n(T) at\r\n\t115F-116A.\n2\nAs that concept was\nexplained\r\n\tin\nTelematrix (Pty) Ltd t/a Matrix\r\n\tVehicle Trading v Advertising Standards Authority\n2006\r\n\t(1) SA 461\n(SCA);\n[2006] 1 All SA 6\n(SCA)\npara 1.\n3\nSee eg\nFourway\r\n\tHaulage SA (Pty) Ltd v SA National Roads Agency Ltd\n2009\r\n\t(2) SA 150\n(SCA):\n[2008] ZASCA 134\npara 12 and the cases there\r\n\tcited.\n4\nTelematrix\npara\r\n\t15.\n5\nP\nara 21.\n6\n2002 (6) SA 431\n(SCA) para 21.\n7\nFourways\nparas\r\n\t23 and 24.\n8\nCf\nInternational\r\n\tShipping Co (Pty) Ltd v Bentley\n1990\r\n\t(1) SA 680\n(A) at 700F-G.\n9\nCf\nFourway Haulage\npara 30-31.\n10\nCf\nFourway Haulage\npara 31-32.",

    "facts": "Delphisure, an insurance broker, attempted to launch a crop‑insurance product called ‘Farmsure’ for wheat farmers in the Western Cape. Although marketing material and a meeting on 5 May 2004 presented Farmsure as fully underwritten by Lloyds, the product never obtained underwriting and never existed. Kolovos, Delphisure’s general manager, told Bexsure’s marketing director, Scott, that the product was ready, leading her to assure farmers that it was available. The first and second respondents, persuaded by these representations, cancelled their applications with Mutual & Federal and applied for Farmsure. The product failed to be underwritten, their crops subsequently failed, and they sued Delphisure for damages based on negligent misrepresentation.",
    "issues": "The court had to determine (1) whether Delphisure (through Kolovos) was liable for negligent misrepresentation causing pure economic loss; (2) whether the loss was reasonably foreseeable; (3) whether the misrepresentation was wrongful in the context of policy considerations; (4) whether factual and legal causation were established for each respondent; and (5) the appropriate cost orders.",
    "principles": "The judgment applied the established test for negligence – duty, breach, foreseeability of harm and causation – and noted that liability for pure economic loss requires a wrongful act grounded in policy. References were made to Fourway Haulage SA (Pty) Ltd v SA National Roads Agency Ltd and Minister of Safety and Security v Van Duivenboden for the balancing of policy factors such as vulnerability of plaintiffs, proximity, and the risk of boundless liability. The court also reiterated that a misrepresentation is actionable when it is made in a business context, the maker has professional standing, and the plaintiff relies on it.",
    "application": "The court found that Kolovos knowingly created the impression that Lloyds had underwritten Farmsure, a clear breach of the duty of care and that such breach was reasonably foreseeable – farmers would likely cancel other insurance and rely on the non‑existent product. Consequently, Delphisure was negligent and liable for the first respondent’s loss. For the second respondent, however, the court held that factual causation was not established because the evidence did not show that, but for the misrepresentation, he would have retained his Mutual & Federal cover; thus his claim failed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal of Delphisure concerning the first respondent’s claim was dismissed, leaving the claim upheld and damages payable to the first respondent. The appeal concerning the second respondent’s claim was upheld, dismissing his claim and ordering him to pay 30% of Delphisure’s costs. Further cost orders required Delphisure to pay the first and third respondents’ costs of appeal, and the second respondent to pay 30% of Delphisure’s appeal costs."
