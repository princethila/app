For purposes of this judgment\nit can\nbe accepted that references to âthe Treasuryâ in both the Act and\nthe regulations are to be construed as referring to\nthe appellant.\n[2]\tThe first respondent is a businessman and a director\nof various companies, including the second respondent. From August\n2002,\nthe appellant held discussions with the two respondents in\nregard to whether various transactions had contravened the\nregulations.\nOn 12 August 2008 the appellant, unpersuaded that the\ntransactions in question did not amount to contraventions, issued the\ndisputed\nnotice purporting to attach various assets of the\nrespondents which it alleged were âmoneys or goodsâ contemplated\nby r 22C.\n[3]\nThis led to\nthe respondents seeking urgent interim relief, including orders\ndeclaring the notice to be invalid and interdicting the\nappellant\nfrom giving effect to the notice pending the outcome of a review\napplication that was yet to be brought, in which additional\nrelief\nwould be sought. The application came before a full bench of the\nNorth Gauteng High Court (Southwood, Murphy and Raulinga\nJJ). One of\nthe grounds upon which it was said by the respondents that the notice\nwas invalid was that r 22C(1) under which the notice\nwas issued was\nsaid itself to be invalid because it was not in conformity with the\nauthorizing statute. In the course of argument\nin the court below\ncounsel for both parties agreed that, if the court were to uphold the\nrespondentsâ contention in that respect,\nthen a final order should\nbe made that the notice was invalid. Having found in their favour the\ncourt below made an order accordingly\nand the prayer for interim\nrelief became superfluous. With the leave of that court that\nappellant now appeals against that order.\n[4]\nAn\nappeal lies against an order that is made by a court and not against\nits reasons for making the order. It follows that on appeal\na\nrespondent is entitled to support the order on any relevant ground\nand is not confined to supporting it only for the reasons given\nby\nthe court below.\n2\nIn this court, the respondent did not seek to support the order on\nany ground than that given by the court below, which was that\nthe\nregulation under which it was made did not conform with the\nauthorising statute and was thus invalid, subject to one subsidiary\nissue that I will come to. This means that the principal issue on\nwhich the appeal turns is whether the full bench was correct in\nits\nconclusion on the invalidity of r 22(C)(1) for the reasons that it\ngave. If the respondent fails on that issue, and on the subsidiary\nissue that I referred to, then the order that it made falls to be set\naside, and the challenge to the validity of the order falls\nto be\ndismissed. The remainder of the notice of motion did no more that\nforeshadow a review application that was yet to be brought\nand need\nnot concern us.\n[5]\tThe regulations were made under\nthe powers extended to the Governor- General (later the State\nPresident and now the President)\nby s 9 of the Act which inter alia\nprovides:\nâ\n(1) The\n(President) may make regulations in regard to any matter directly or\nindirectly relating to or affecting or having any bearing\nupon\ncurrency, banking or exchanges.\n(2)(\na)\nSuch regulations may provide that the (President) may apply any\nsanctions therein set forth which he thinks fit to impose, whether\ncivil or criminal.\n(b)\nAny\nregulation contemplated in paragraph (a) may provide for-\n(i)\tthe blocking, attachment and\nobtaining of interdicts for a period referred to in paragraph (g) by\nthe Treasury and the forfeiture\nand disposal by the Treasury of any\nmoney or goods referred to or defined in the regulations or\ndetermined in terms of the regulations\nor any money or goods into\nwhich such money or goods have been transformed by any person, and-\n(aa)\twhich are suspected by the\nTreasury on reasonable grounds to be involved in an offence or\nsuspected offence against any regulation\nreferred to in this section,\nor in respect of which such offence has been committed or so\nsuspected to have been committed;\n(bb)\twhich are in the possession\nof the offender, suspected offender or any other person or have been\nobtained by any such person\nor are due to any such person and which\nwould not have been in such possession or so obtained or due if such\noffence or suspected\noffence had not been committed; or\n(cc)\tby which the offender,\nsuspected offender or any other person has been benefited or enriched\nas a result of such offence or suspected\noffence -\nProvided that, in the case of\nany person other than the offender or suspected offender, no such\nmoney or goods shall be blocked, attached,\ninterdicted, forfeited and\ndisposed of if such money or goods were acquired by such person bona\nfide for reasonable consideration\nas a result of a transaction in the\nordinary course of business and not in contravention of the\nregulations; and\n(ii)\tin general, any matter\nwhich the (President) deems necessary for the fulfilment of the\nobjectives and purposes referred to in\nsubparagraph (i), including\nthe blocking, attachment, interdicting, forfeiture and disposal\nreferred to in subparagraph (i) by the\nTreasury of any other money or\ngoods belonging to the offender, suspected offender or any other\nperson in order to recover an amount\nequal to the value of\nthe\nmoney or goods, recoverable in terms of the regulations referred to\nin subparagraph (i), but which can for any reason not be so\nrecovered.\n(c)  . . .\n(d) Any regulation contemplated\nin paragraph (a) shall provide-\n(i)\tthat any person who feels\naggrieved by any decision made or action taken by any person in the\nexercise of his powers under a regulation\nreferred to in paragraph\n(b) which has the effect of blocking, attaching or interdicting any\nmoney or goods, may lodge an application\nin a competent court for the\nrevision of such decision or action or for any other relief . . .\n(ii)   . . .\n(iii)   that any person who\nfeels aggrieved by any decision to forfeit and dispose of such money\nor goods may, within a period prescribed\nby the regulations, which\nshall not be less than 90 days after the date of the notice published\nin the Gazette and referred to in\nsubparagraph (ii), institute legal\nproceedings in a competent court for the setting aside of such\ndecision, and the court shall not\nset aside such decision unless it\nis satisfied-\n(aa)\tthat the person who made\nsuch decision did not act in accordance with the relevant provisions\nof the regulation; or\n(bb)\tthat such person did not\nhave grounds to make such decision; or\nthat the grounds for the\n\tmaking of such decision no longer exist.\n(e)   . . .\n(f)   . . .\n(g) The period referred to in\nparagraph (b) (i) shall be a period not exceeding 36 months or such\nlonger period-\n(i)\tas ends 12 months after the\nfinal judgment (including on appeal, if any) in every prosecution for\nany contravention of the regulations\nor any other law in relation to\nthe money or goods concerned or in which such money or goods are\nrelevant to any aspect of such prosecution;\nor\n(ii)\tas may be determined by a\ncompetent court in relation to the money or goods concerned on good\ncause shown by the Treasury.â\n[6]\tAs appears from this, a distinction is drawn between\nmoney and goods involved or suspected of having been involved in any\ncontravention\nof the regulations\n(sometimes\nreferred to as âtaintedâ money or goods) and other money and\ngoods (which may be described as âuntaintedâ). The\nPresident is\nempowered by s 9(2)(b)(i) to make regulations relating to the\nattachment, freezing and forfeiture of tainted money and\ngoods for a\nperiod referred to in s 9(2)(g) and by s 9(2)(b)(ii) to make\nregulations in general in respect of any matter which he\nâdeems\nnecessary for fulfilment of the objectives and purposes referred toâ\nin s 9(2)(b)(i) including the attachment and freezing\nof untainted\nmoney and goods. Although no specific reference is made to 9(2)(g) in\ns 9(2)(b)(ii), the reference in that subparagraph\nto an attachment or\nfreezing âreferred to in subparagraph (i)â leads to the\nreasonable conclusion that the legislature intended\nthe prescribed\ntime limit to also apply to the attachment and freezing of untainted\nmoney and goods.\n[7]\nRegulations\n22A, 22B and 22C of the regulations made by the President provide for\nthe blocking of accounts, the attachment of money\nand goods, and the\nforfeiture and disposal of money or goods as envisaged by s 9(2)(b).\nIn\nSouth African\nReserve Bank v Torwood Properties (Pty) Ltd\n3\nHarms JA, after describing these regulations as being both âlengthy\nand convolutedâ\n4\nâ a fitting description for s 9 as well â went on to explain\ntheir effect in broad terms as follows:\n5\nâ\nWhat is contemplated by the\nregulation, in very general terms, seems (by way of an example) to be\nthis: A contravention of the regulations\nis committed. The amount\ninvolved is Rx. That amount may be recovered by the Treasury. It may\nrecover by attaching and declaring\nforfeit, for example, the money\nâinvolvedâ in the contravention. If that Rx cannot be found, the\nshortfall may be recovered by\nthe attachment of âotherâ\n(untainted) money or goods from the persons mentioned in subpara (i)\nto (iv) of reg 22C(1).â\n[8]\nFor present\npurposes it suffices to record the following in regard to the\nregulations:\nRegulation r 22A deals with the\n\ttainted goods and money, with r 22A(1)(a) providing for the\n\tattachment of tainted money and goods\nand r 22A(1)(b) and (c) \n\tproviding for the prohibition of withdrawals out of accounts into\n\twhich tainted money is reasonably suspected\nof having been deposited\n\tand the prohibition of the use of tainted goods (this may loosely be\n\tdescribed as the âfreezingâ of\nsuch money and goods). Regulation\n\t22A(3) provides that if attached tainted money and goods are not\n\tforfeited under r 22B within\nâthe period referred to in paragraph\n\t(g) of section 9(2) of the Actâ, they are to be returned.\nRegulation\n22C, on the other hand, deals with untainted money and goods, with r\n\t22C(1) providing for the attachment of untainted money and\ngoods and\n\tr 22C(2) providing for the issue of an order freezing untainted\n\tmoney and goods. Importantly, while r 22C(3)(b) provides\nfor the\n\tprovisions of 22A(3) to apply mutatis mutandis to a freezing order\n\tunder r 22C(2), no specific provision is made for a\nsimilar time\n\tperiod to apply to  attachments under r 22C(1).\nRegulation 22B deals with the\n\tprocedures necessary to obtain forfeiture of both tainted and\n\tuntainted moneys and goods.\n[9]\tThe Presidentâs failure to\nprovide a time limit on the duration of an attachment of untainted\nmoney and goods formed the cornerstone\nof the full benchâs finding\nthat r 22C(1) is invalid. It found that s 9(2) rendered it mandatory\nfor the President to stipulate\na time period not exceeding that\nprescribed by s 9(2)(g) for the attachment of such assets. It also\nheld that the omission of a reference\nto r 22C(1) in r 22C(3)(b) had\nto be regarded as intentional and excluded the operation of a time\nlimit. It therefore concluded that\nan attachment for an unlimited\nperiod was intentionally envisaged by r 22C(1), a provision which is\nin conflict with the provisions\nof the Act and therefore invalid.\n6\n[10]\tThe first question to be\nconsidered is whether the legislature intended s 9(2) to prescribe\nthe form in which the regulations\nwere to be drawn (by directing that\nthey had to state, or at least refer to, a period for which the\nattachment or freezing was to\nremain in force) or simply intended to\nprescribe a limit, as an objective matter of law, to the period for\nwhich such attachment\nor freezing could endure. In my view, all the\nindications in the section are in favour of the latter intention.\n[11]\nThe\nprovisions of s 9(2)(g) contemplate three different situations. The\nfirst is the basic situation where an attachment or freezing\nis to be\neffected â it may remain in force for a period of at most 36\nmonths. The second is where there is a prosecution for an\noffence in\nwhich the affected assets have been involved or are owned by a person\ncontemplated in ss 9(2)(b)(ii) â the attachment\nor freezing will be\neffective until the expiry of 12 months after a final judgment. The\nthird contemplates an application to court\nfor an extension of the\nperiod on good cause shown by the Treasury. In my view, if the\nlegislature had intended that this comparatively\ncomplicated\nformulation had to be spelt out in the regulations, it would have\nsaid so. It follows that the more reasonable conclusion\nis that the\nintention behind s 9(2)(g) was to set a statutory time limit for the\nduration of an attachment or freezing of money or\ngoods and was not\nintended to prescribe the content of the regulations and to require\nthe President to determine a time limit in\nthe regulations. All it\nmeans is that these orders may not last longer than the prescribed\nlimit.\n[12]\nThe\nnext question is whether the regulation, by omitting any reference to\na time limit, means that the President sought to give a\npower to the\nTreasury that is not limited in time. I think not. The regulations\nare not to be read in isolation. Where possible,\nthey are to be\nconstrued consistently with the empowering Act under which they were\nmade.\n7\nNo matter how clear and unequivocal regulations may appear to be,\nâtheir interpretation and validity are dependent upon the\nempowering\nprovisions which authorise them.â\n8\nThe regulations must therefore be read in the light of the provisions\nof s 9(2) and its purpose and objectives â including that\nthe\nattachment of money and goods may not be for a period longer than\nthat prescribed in the Act. It therefore cannot be argued that\nmerely\nbecause no mention of the time limitation contained in s 9(2)(g) is\nmade in the regulations, it does not apply to an attachment\nmade\nunder the regulations.\n[13]\nIn\nmy view, the full bench therefore erred in its conclusion that s 9\nrequired the President to stipulate a time period in the regulations\nfor the attachment and freezing of untainted money and goods. The\nplain meaning of s 9(2) is that while the President is empowered\nto\nmake regulations under which money and goods may be attached and\nfrozen, no such attachment or freezing is to last for longer\nthan the\nprescribed period. The section does not require that period to be\nreiterated in the regulations. In addition, the fact that\nno such\ntime limit is specified in the regulation does not mean that an\nattachment under r 22C(1) can last indefinitely. It can only\nendure\nas long as the maximum period prescribed by s 9(2)(g). The fact that\nthe President unnecessarily referred to the period in\ns 9(2)(g) in\ncertain other regulations does not mean that his failure to also do\nso in respect of attached untainted goods and money\nrenders r 22C(1)\ninvalid.\n[14]\nThe\nsubsidiary issue that next arises is whether the notice was invalid\nbecause it did not contain a time limit. In my view it was\nnot\nrequired of Treasury to set a time limit in the notice. If it omits\nto do so, as it did in this case, the default position is\nregulated\nby statute and the notice lapses after three years.\n[15]\nThe\nfull bench consequently erred in concluding that r 22C(1) was invalid\nand in setting aside the warrants. The appeal must therefore\nsucceed.\nThe parties were correctly agreed that costs should follow the event\nand that the employment if two counsel was justified.\n[16]\nIn\nthe result I order as follows:\n1.\nThe\nappeal succeeds with costs, including the costs of two counsel;\n2.\nThe\norder of the full bench is set aside and is replaced with the\nfollowing:\nâ\nThe application is dismissed with costs, including\nthe costs of two counsel.â\n_______________\nL E LEACH\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT:\t\tP G Ginsburg SC (with him K W LÃ¼deritz)\nInstructed by Newtons Inc, Pretoria\nSymington & De Kok, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENTS:\t\tA Bhana SC\nInstructed by Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc,\nSandown\t\t\t\tMatsepes Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nPromulgated under\nsection 9\nof the\nCurrency and Exchanges Act 9 of\n1933\nin Government Notice R 1111 of 1961and amended up to Government\n\tNotice R 855 in Government Gazette no 20299 of 23 July 1999.\n2\nPer Trollip JA in\nSentrale\n\tKunsmis Korporasie (Edms) Bpk v N.K.P.

    "facts": "The South African Reserve Bank (the appellant) issued a notice of attachment on 12 August 2008 under regulation 22C(1) of the Exchange Control Regulations, alleging that assets of Mzilikazi Godfrey Khumalo and Mawenzi Resources and Finance Company were linked to alleged contraventions of the regulations. The respondents applied for urgent interim relief, seeking a declaration that the notice was invalid and an interdict against its effect pending a forthcoming review application. The North Gauteng High Court (Full Bench) held that regulation 22C(1) was invalid because it failed to incorporate the time‑limit prescribed by section 9(2)(g) of the Currency and Exchanges Act, and consequently set aside the attachment notice. The Reserve Bank appealed that decision.",
    "issues": "1. Whether regulation 22C(1) of the Exchange Control Regulations is invalid for not specifying a time‑limit for the attachment of untainted money or goods, contrary to section 9(2)(g) of the Currency and Exchanges Act. 2. Whether a notice of attachment issued under an allegedly invalid regulation is itself invalid for failing to contain a time‑limit. 3. Whether the High Court’s order setting aside the attachment should be upheld.",
    "principles": "The court examined the purposive interpretation of section 9(2) of the Currency and Exchanges Act, concluding that the provision sets a maximum statutory period for attachment or freezing (up to 36 months, or longer where a prosecution or court extension applies) but does not require the regulations to repeat the time‑limit. Regulations must be read consistently with their empowering statute and cannot grant powers that exceed the statutory ceiling. Precedent from South African Reserve Bank v Torwood Properties was cited regarding the scope of attachment powers. The absence of a time‑limit in a regulation does not render an attachment indefinite; it is limited by the statutory maximum.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court held that the President was not obliged to embed the time‑limit in regulation 22C(1); the regulation merely confers the power to attach, which is automatically bounded by the period set out in section 9(2)(g). Consequently, regulation 22C(1) remains valid. Similarly, the notice of attachment need not expressly state the time‑limit; it lapses after the statutory period (three years) if no action is taken. The High Court’s finding of invalidity was therefore erroneous.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded. The order of the North Gauteng High Court was set aside and replaced with a dismissal of the respondents’ application, with costs awarded to the Reserve Bank, including the costs of two counsel."
