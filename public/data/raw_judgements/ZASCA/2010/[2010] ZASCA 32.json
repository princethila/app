For convenience I shall refer to\nthe parties as\r\nplaintiff and defendants as in the court a quo. In that action the\r\nplaintiff sought an order directing the third\ndefendant to rectify\r\nthe title deeds of portions 2 and 3 of the farm Mazunga 142,\r\nRegistration Division K.T., Limpopo Province\nto indicate that the\r\ndeceased estate of John Meintjes (ID 170610 0008 086) is the\r\nregistered owner of the said portions. In the\nalternative he sought\r\nan order compelling the first and second defendants to sign the\r\nnecessary documentation to effect the transfer\nof portions 2 and 3 of\r\nthe farm Mazunga 142, Registration Division K.T., Limpopo Province,\r\nto the deceased estate within 30 days\nof the order, failing which the\r\nsheriff within whose jurisdiction area farm Mazunga 142 is situated,\r\nis authorised to sign all\nnecessary documents to effect such\r\nretransfer. In its dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim the court\r\na quo found that the first\nand second defendants had succeeded in\r\nproving their defence of waiver. The matter is now before this Court\r\nwith the leave of the\ncourt a quo.\n[2]\tIn my view the facts of this case are not in\r\ndispute but the sole question for decision on appeal is whether the\r\ndeceased had\nwaived or abandoned her right to the ownership of\r\nportions 2 and 3 of her property, which were fraudulently transferred\r\nby the\nfirst and second defendants into their names. Allied to this\r\nissue is the question whether immovable property is capable of being\n\ntransferred by way of waiver without a deed of alienation duly signed\r\nby both the owner and the transferee as required by s 2(1)\nof the\r\nAlienation of Land Act 68 of 1981 (the Act).\n[3]\tA short backdrop of the history of the matter\r\nis perhaps necessary. The plaintiff, the first and second defendants\r\nare the children\nof the deceased John Meintjes, their mother,\r\nalthough the name may misrepresent her gender. She owned the farm\r\nMazunga (the farm)\nsituated in the Limpopo Province as described\r\nabove. She lived on the farm with the plaintiff and his family. In\r\n1993 she made\na will wherein she bequeathed all her property to her\r\nchildren in three equal shares. In 1998 she applied for a subdivision\r\nof\nthe farm into three portions, which subdivision application was\r\ngranted. In 2003 she made another will in which she bequeathed each\n\nspecific portion of the farm to her respective children. The first\r\nand second defendants were to receive portions 2 and 3 respectively.\n[4]\nThe deceased became\r\nill and died in January 2006. Before she died the first and second\r\ndefendants clandestinely orchestrated a transfer\nof portions 2 and 3\r\nof the farm into their names. This, they did without the deceased's\r\nknowledge. Documents were falsified and\neventually portions 2 and 3\r\nof the farm were transferred and registered into their names. In the\r\nyear 2002 a purported deed of\nsale in respect of portion 3 was\r\nproduced and in June 2003 a purported deed of sale in respect of\r\nportion 2 was produced. The deceased\ndid not sign any deed of sale or\r\ntransfer documents at any stage. Even the so-called transfer\r\ndocuments, for example, the power\nof attorney and related documents\r\nthat were put up were false.\n[5]\nThere were family\r\nmeetings taking place between the deceased and her children at\r\ndifferent places and with different persons in\nthe person of her\r\nchildren. Eventually in 2004 the deceased became aware that portions\r\n2 and 3 of the farm had been fraudulently\ntransferred and registered\r\nin the names of the first and second defendants. The plaintiff also\r\nbecame aware of this fact\n–\nhence the action in 2007 in his capacity as executor of the\r\ndeceased's estate.\n[6]\tIn their plea the first and second defendants\r\ndenied that they forged transfer documents but later filed an amended\r\nplea wherein\nthey included a special plea that the plaintiff's action\r\nagainst them had become prescribed. In the alternative they pleaded\r\nthat\nif it be found that the deceased did not sign the necessary\r\nconveyancing documents required for the transfer of portions 2 and 3\n\nand that the registration of portions 2 and 3 is unlawful, then in\r\nthat event, the deceased knew that portions 2 and 3 of the farm\nhad\r\nbeen transferred into their names but failed to take any action to\r\nreclaim the said property. Accordingly, continued the plea,\nthe\r\ndeceased had expressly waived or abandoned her right to claim the\r\nreturn of portions 2 and 3 of the farm by signing a 'Kwitansie\nen\r\nVrywaring\" in favour of the first and second defendants\r\nendorsing the transfer. And further alternatively, they pleaded\nthat\r\nthe deceased tacitly waived her right to claim the retransfer of\r\nportions 2 and 3 of the farm.\n[7]\tThe first and second defendants included a\r\ncounterclaim wherein they requested a joinder of the plaintiff in his\r\npersonal capacity.\nConsequently they asked for the eviction of the\r\nplaintiff from portions 2 and 3 of the farm and costs of the\r\ncounterclaim.\n[8]\tThe plaintiff's claim is founded on\nrei\r\nvindicatio\n. The first and second\r\ndefendants sought to counter by resorting to the flimsy defence of\r\nwaiver which was doomed to fail from the\nmoment it was made. The\r\nplaintiff contends, correctly in my view, that the deceased never\r\nlost her right of ownership, notwithstanding\nthe fact that portions 2\r\nand 3 of the farm had already been transferred and registered in the\r\nnames of the first and second defendants\nby illegal means. In\nLegator\r\n McKenna v Shea & others\n[2008]\r\nZASCA 144\n;\n2010 (1) SA 35\n(SCA) at para 22 Brand JA said the\r\nfollowing:\n'[22]\nIn\r\naccordance with the abstract theory the requirements for the passing\r\nof ownership are twofold, namely delivery\n\r\nwhich in the case of immovable property is effected by registration\r\nof transfer in the deeds office  coupled with\na so-called\r\nreal agreement or \"saaklike ooreenkoms\". The essential\r\nelements of the real agreement are an intention on\nthe part of the\r\ntransferor to transfer ownership and the intention of the transferee\r\nto become the owner of the property (see eg\nAir-Kel\r\n(Edms) Bpk h/a Merkel Motors v Bodenstein en 'n Ander\n1980 (3) SA 917\n(A) at 922E-F;\nDreyer\r\nand Another NNO v AXZS Industries (Pty) Ltd\nsupra at para 17). Broadly stated, the principles applicable to\r\nagreements in general also apply to real agreements. Although the\n\nabstract theory does not require a valid underlying contract, eg\r\nsale, ownership will not pass  despite registration of\n\ntransfer  if there is a defect in the real agreement (see eg\nPreller and Others v\r\nJordaan\n1956 (1) SA\r\n483\n(A) at 496;\nKlerck\r\nNO v Van Zyl and Maritz NNO\nsupra at 174A-B;\nSilberberg\r\nand Schoeman\nop cit\r\nat 79-80).'\n(See also\nDu Plessis\r\nv Prophitius & another\n[2009] ZASCA\r\n79\n;\n2010 (1) SA 49\n(SCA) wherein Ponnan JA referred to\nLegator\nwith approval).\n[9]\nAs we know real\r\nrights may be acquired by various modes that are not reflected in the\r\nDeeds Office, for example by prescription,\nexpropriation etc. In such\r\ncircumstances the owner can trump a bona fide possessor who acquired\r\nthe property from the person registered\nas owner in the Deeds\r\nRegistry. The Registrar of Deeds under the negative system of\r\nregistration, which was adopted in South Africa\nfrom Roman-Dutch law,\r\nplays a rather passive role, however, he examines every deed\r\ncarefully before registering it, but mistakes\ndo happen. For example\r\nwhere the signature of the transferor is forged, as is the case in\r\nthe matter before us, the court will\norder rectification of the Deeds\r\nRegistry, in favour of the original owner. This will be so even\r\nagainst the bona fide acquirer.\nIn the present case,\na\r\nfortiori\n, the first and second\r\ndefendants are not bona fide acquirers as they admittedly forged the\r\ndeceased’s signature. (See also\nPreller\r\n& others v Jordaan\n1956 (1) SA 483\n(A) at 496). Mr Bergenthuin SC, for the plaintiff, referred to\nKristal v Rowell\n1904 TH 66\nat 71 where the power of attorney under which the mortgage\r\nwas executed was forged it was held that the mortgage therefore\r\nconferred\nno right or title of any sort upon the acquirer and the\r\noriginal owner was entitled to have it cancelled.\n[10]\nIn the present case\r\nit is common cause that no deed of alienation in terms of s 2(1)\r\nof the Act was signed by the owner and\nthe defendants to effect a\r\nsale or transfer of any portion of the farm. Therefore there was no\r\nlegal foundation to effect transfer\nto the first and second\r\ndefendants. Even the obligation creating the agreement was falsified.\r\nThe deceased did not and could not\nlose her right of ownership. It\r\nmay well be that on an earlier occasion the deceased intended to\r\ntransfer portions of her farm\nto her three children, the plaintiff\r\nand the first and second defendants. In 1998 she applied for a\r\nsub-division of her property.\nTo this may be added the fact that she\r\nfollowed this up with a will she signed in 1993 (referred to in para\r\n3 above). It must however\nbe remembered that a will only takes effect\r\nupon the death of the testator. The 1993 will never took effect as it\r\nwas revoked by\na new will in 2005 in which she left her entire estate\r\nto the plaintiff. Accordingly the 1993 will, cannot be relied upon by\r\nthe\nfirst and second defendants as evidence pointing to their\r\nownership of portions 2 and 3 of the farm.\n[11]\tIt is contended by the first and second\r\ndefendants that the deceased was fully aware during her lifetime of\r\nthe transfer of\nportions 2 and 3 of the farms to the defendants. They\r\nargue further that the inaction of the deceased arose from the fact\r\nthat\nthe deceased was satisfied with the two portions of the farm\r\nremaining in the defendants' names. They cite the making of a new\r\nwill in 2005 wherein she bequeathed all her estate to the plaintiff\r\nas the basis for concluding that she abandoned her right to\nportions\r\n2 and 3. They argue that the entire estate referred to in the 2005\r\nwill is portion 1, which was not mentioned by the deceased\nin the\r\nwill. Their argument as to waiver is untenable and unsustainable. The\r\nfirst and second defendants bore the onus to establish\nthat a waiver\r\nhad occurred. For a waiver to be effectual they had to show that the\r\ndeceased, with the full knowledge of her right\nto portions 2 and 3,\r\ndecided to abandon it, ‘whether expressly or by conduct plainly\r\ninconsistent with an intention to enforce\nit.’ (\nLaws\r\nv Rutherfurd\n1924 AD at 263). What\r\nhappened in this case is plainly inconsistent with that intention.\r\nWhen the deceased made her last will she\nbequeathed her entire estate\r\nto the plaintiff and not the ‘remainder’ thereof. If her\r\nintention had been to abandon\nportions 2 and 3 one would have\r\nexpected her to state unequivocally that she was giving the plaintiff\r\nonly portion 1 or at the\nvery least the remainder of her estate.\n[12]\tThe first and second defendants also raised\r\nthe question of prescription as a possible defence in the court a quo\r\nbut it was\nnot persisted in on appeal, the court a quo dismissed it\r\nand there is no cross-appeal, therefore there is no need to deal with\r\nit in this judgment. Section 28(2) of the Act was found to be\r\nirrelevant because the transfer to the defendants took place on a\n\ndeed of sale which the deceased did not sign and the deed of transfer\r\nand related documents were also falsified.\n[13]\tIt does not appear that the court a quo\r\naddressed itself to prayer 2 of the plaintiff’s claim which is\r\nbased on the\nrei vindicatio\n.\r\nIt is my considered view that had it done so the outcome might have\r\nbeen different, in that it would have enquired into the principles\n\nrelating to the acquisition and loss of ownership of immovable\r\nproperty. In any event mere registration does not afford proof of\n\nownership.\n[14]\nMr Omar for the\r\nfirst and second defendants referred this court to\nKnysna\r\nHotel CC v Coetzee N\nO\n[1997] ZASCA 114\n;\n1998 (2) SA 743\n(SCA) at 754D-E. He relied heavily on this case to show that where\r\nall the formalities of a transfer have been complied with, accepted\n\nby the Registrar of Deeds, and where transfer is registered in the\r\nDeeds Registry, there is a formal and legally valid transfer\nthat\r\nwill remain binding until it is set aside by an order of court. The\r\nfacts in\nKnysna\nare distinguishable to the present case in that in\nKnysna\nonly the deed of transfer was valid whereas in the present case both\r\nthe obligation creating agreement (causa) and the real agreement\nwere\r\nabsent due the fraudulent conduct of the defendants.\n[1\n5]\tThe fact that both\r\nthe obligation creating agreement, and the real agreement were\r\nfalsified is enough to deal a fatal blow to\nfirst and second\r\ndefendants' defence who are in fact asking this court to countenance\r\ntheir fraudulent actions. Their actions are,\nindeed, contrary to\r\npublic policy. In the words of Ngcobo J in\nBarkhuizen\r\nv Napier\n2007 (5) SA 327\n(CC) para 28:\n'Public policy represents the legal\r\nconvictions of the community; it represents those values that are\r\nheld most dear by the society\n. . . . Since the advent of our constitutional democracy, public\r\npolicy is now deeply rooted in our Constitution and the values\nthat\r\nunderlie it.'\nI may add that courts should decline to enforce or\r\ngive life to contracts that are in conflict with constitutional\r\nvalues even though\nthe parties may have consented to them. In\nthis\r\ninstance the first and second defendants are asking this court to\r\ngive life to an illegal and fraudulently obtained right by\nway of\r\nrecognising a waiver by the deceased. Therefore a contract that is\r\ninimical to the values enshrined in our constitution\nis contrary to\r\npublic policy and is unenforceable.\n[16]\tThe first and second defendants bore the onus\r\nthroughout to prove waiver or abandonment. The mere fact that the\r\nproperty is\nregistered in the name of a person does not translate\r\ninto ownership. Ownership may be acquired by prescription or by\r\nabandonment\neven if the property is not registered in one's name. For\r\nabandonment of property there must be an intention by the owner to\r\nabandon\nthe property - see\nMinister van\r\nLandbou v Sonnendecker\n1979 (2) SA 944\n(A) at 764H. Munnik AJ in\nUnion Free\r\nState Mining and Finance Corporation Ltd v Union Free State Gold and\r\nDiamond Corporation Ltd\n1960 (4) SA 547\n(W) at 549C-E said the following:\n'I do not think that a creditor can\r\nby the mere exercise of his will terminate the obligation without the\r\nconcurrence of the debtor\nbecause as both\nWessels\nand\nPothier\npoint out a release, waiver or abandonment is tantamount to making a\r\ndonation to the debtor of the obligation from which he is\nto be\r\nreleased and until that donation has been accepted it has not been\r\nperfected. There may conceivably be circumstances in which\na debtor\r\ndoes not wish to be released from his obligation. It may for a\r\nvariety of reasons not suit him to be released. To allow\nthe release,\r\nwaiver or abandonment and the consequent making of a donation\r\ndependent solely on the will or action of the creditor\nwould be\r\ntantamount to creating a contract at the will of one party which is a\r\nconcept foreign to our jurisprudence.'\nSee also Christie,\nThe\r\nLaw of Contract in South Africa\n5 ed\r\n(2006) pp 437-438.\n[17]\tThe deceased is said to have had knowledge of\r\nthe registration of transfer of portions 2 and 3 of the farm onto the\r\nnames of\nthe first and second defendants. Examples are derived from\r\nthe 'Kwitansie en Vrywaring', the letter to the bank dated 6 May 2005\n\nadvising the bank manager to alter her will to exclude the first and\r\nthe second defendants as the transfer of portions 2 and 3\nhad already\r\nbeen effected; the conversations the deceased had with the plaintiff\r\nand his wife; and the tape recordings. Despite\nall these happenings\r\nthe deceased did not exercise her right to reclaim portions 2 and 3.\r\nThe first and second defendants conclude\nthat she waived or abandoned\r\nher right to reclaim the property. It is difficult to place any\r\nevidentiary value to these phenomena\nas each role player had a motive\r\nfor trying to influence the deceased one way or the other. The\r\ndeceased may not have been aware\nthat some of these things did take\r\nplace. Therefore it cannot be said that she intentionally or tacitly\r\nabandoned her right to\nreclaim her property.\n[18]\tIn the light of the reasoning proffered above\r\nthe counterclaim must also fail.\n[19]\tThe\nfollowing order\r\nis made:\n1.\tThe appeal is upheld with costs, such costs to be paid by the\r\nfirst and second respondents, jointly and severally the one paying\n\nthe other to be absolved.\n2.\tThe order of the court a quo is set aside and substituted with the\r\nfollowing:\n‘\n(a)\tThe third defendant is ordered to\r\nrectify the title deed of Portion 2 and Portion 3 of Mazunga 142,\r\nRegistration Division KT\nLimpopo Province, by cancelling the transfer\r\nand registration of the said portions in the names of first\r\ndefendant, Isabella Christena\nCoetzer and the second defendant,\r\nJohannes Meintjes, and re-transferring and registering the said\r\nPortion 2 and Portion 3 into\nthe name of deceased estate of John\r\nMeintjes (ID 170610 0008 086).\n(b)\tThe first and second defendant’s counter claim is\r\ndismissed.\n(c)\tThe first and second defendant’s are\r\nordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs, jointly and severally the\r\none paying\nthe other to be absolved.’\n_________________\nJ SHONGWE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nLEACH JA\n[20]   I have read the judgment prepared by Shongwe JA and although I\r\nagree with his conclusion that the appeal should be upheld\nand an\r\norder made in the terms he proposes, I have reached that conclusion\r\nby a somewhat different route which renders it unnecessary\nto\r\ndetermine some of the issues with which he has dealt.\n[21]   At the outset, I must record that cases\r\nsuch as\nDu Plessis v Prophitius\nand\nLegator McKenna\n(see para 8 above)\nrecognised\r\nthe abstract theory of transfer as part of our law, and that  under\r\nthat theory, even though a valid underlying contract\n(eg of sale) is\r\nnot necessary, the passing of ownership of immovable property only\r\ntakes place when there has been delivery effected\nby registration of\r\ntransfer coupled with a so called ‘real agreement’ or\r\n‘saaklike ooreenkoms’, the essential\nelements of which\r\nare an intention on the part of a transferor to transfer ownership\r\ncoupled with a corresponding intention on\nthe part of the transferee\r\nto become the new owner – so that if there is a defect in the\r\nreal agreement, ownership will not\npass even if registration of\r\ntransfer takes place.\n[22]   In the present case, not only was there no valid deed of\r\nalienation of the disputed portions of the farm to the first and\n\nsecond defendants as the deceased’s signature thereon had been\r\nforged, but the necessary transfer documents had also been\nsimilarly\r\nfalsified. In these circumstances, despite the registrar of deeds\r\nhaving effected registration of transfer, there can\nbe no doubt that\r\nthe deceased never intended to transfer ownership of the two disputed\r\nportions of the farm to the first and second\ndefendants at the time\r\nregistration of transfer was effected. She therefore remained the\r\nowner thereof as my learned brother has\ncorrectly concluded.\n[23]   In order to succeed the first and second defendants therefore\r\nhad to prove that after the deceased had become aware of the\n\nfraudulent transfer of the two portions of the farm, she had waived\r\nher right to reclaim them. For present purposes I am prepared\nto\r\naccept, but without deciding, that a waiver in these circumstances\r\ncould constitute a valid real agreement for the transfer\nof ownership\r\n(although a potential difficulty seems to me to be that in these\r\ncircumstances a waiver is no more than a\ndonation which in itself would be ineffective as not having been\r\nrecorded in writing and signed as required by\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act 68 of 1981\n). But should no such waiver have\r\ntaken place, the necessary factual foundation of the first and second\r\ndefendants’ defence\nfalls away and makes it unnecessary to\r\ndecide any further legal issues.\n[24]   In order to succeed the first and second\r\ndefendants were obliged to show that the deceased, with full\r\nknowledge of her right\nto reclaim the two portions of the farm (or\r\nput differently, her rights of the ownership in those portions),\r\ndecided to abandon\nsuch claim, whether expressly or by her conduct.\r\nAs was observed by Innes CJ more than three quarters of a century\r\nago, an observation\nwhich remains as valid today as it did then, a\r\nwaiver is a question of fact which is always difficult to establish.\r\n(\nLaws v Rutherfurd\n1924 AD 261\nat 263).\n[25]\tIn seeking to establish such a waiver in\r\ntheir favour, the first and second defendants referred to a number of\r\nfactors. In\nparticular they emphasized that during the 16 month\r\nperiod from when she learned of the fraudulent transfer of two thirds\r\nof the\nfarm, the deceased did not institute action to enforce her\r\nclaim for retransfer. It was also alleged that the deceased’s\r\nalteration to her last will and testament, and her written\r\ninstruction to her attorney to amend her existing will, indicated\r\nthat\nshe must have had the intention to abide by the transfer of the\r\ndisputed two thirds of the farm.\n[26]   Although I shall deal with these factors\r\nlater, the immediate difficulty that I have with this argument is\r\nthat the first\nand second defendants never sought to make out a case\r\nthat during her lifetime the deceased had communicated to them,\r\neither expressly\nor through her conduct, that she had waived her\r\nclaim or that they had accepted such a waiver. As was held in this\r\ncourt in\nTraub v Barclays National Bank\r\nLtd\n;\nKalk\r\nv Barclays National Bank Ltd\n1983 (3)\r\nSA 619\n(A) at 634-635 a creditor’s intention not to enforce a\r\nright has no legal effect unless and until there is some expression\n\nor manifestation of it which is communicated to the person in whose\r\nfavour the right is waived or in some way brought to his knowledge,\n\nand that any mental resolve not communicated to the other party and\r\nonly discovered later has no effect.\n[27]   Accordingly, without the first and second\r\ndefendants showing that the deceased communicated an intent to waive\r\nher claim\nwhich they accepted in her lifetime – and in that\r\nregard facts of which they learned only after her death, eg, that the\r\ndeceased\nhad altered her will, cannot be relied on\nex\r\npost facto\nto establish a waiver on her\r\npart – there can be no suggestion of a waiver by the deceased. \r\nAs it was never the first and\nsecond defendants’ case that they\r\nhad accepted a waiver in their favour during the lifetime of the\r\ndeceased, on that basis\nalone they must fail.\n[28] But in any event, I agree with Shongwe JA\r\nthat the first and second defendants failed to establish an intention\r\non the part\nof the deceased to waive her claim. At the outset, it is\r\ninherently improbable that a person will lightly waive the right of\r\nownership\nin valuable property out of which he or she has been\r\ndefrauded. (Compare\nFinancial Mail (Pty)\r\nLtd & others v Sage Holdings Ltd & another\n[1993] ZASCA 3\n;\n1993 (2) SA 451\n(A) at 469B-C). Moreover the fact that the deceased\r\nchanged her will to exclude reference to the first two defendants, on\r\nwhich\nthey rely upon as showing that she accepted that it was\r\nunnecessary to mention them in her will as their portions of the farm\r\nhad\nalready been transferred to them, is equally consistent for the\r\ndeceased being so angered by their fraudulent conduct that she had\n\ndecided to remove them as beneficiaries. Equivocal conduct of this\r\nkind is by its very nature insufficient to establish a clear\n\nintention to waive. (Compare\nVan\r\nRensburg & andere v Taute & andere\n1975 (1) SA 279\n(A) at 308).\n[29]   The first two defendants also rely upon the written\r\ninstruction the deceased addressed to her bank to vary her will\r\nwhich,\nthey argue, can only be regarded as amounting to an indication\r\nthat she accepted the fraudulent transfer and did not intend to take\n\nsteps to seek to recover the two portions of the farm. Suffice it to\r\nsay that I do not think that this correspondence can carry\nthe day.\r\nOne does not know how it came about that the letter in question was\r\nprepared and typed or under what circumstances the\ndeceased came to\r\nsign it. In the light of the admitted fraud perpetrated in respect of\r\nthe deed of sale and transfer of portions\nof the farm, any\r\ndocumentation must be viewed with some suspicion. And when weighed up\r\nagainst an undisputed allegation that the\ndeceased, after learning of\r\nthe fraudulent transfer of the two portions of the farm to the first\r\nand second defendants, had passed\na remark to the effect that they\r\nhad ‘hulle kele afgesny’ (slit their own throats) before\r\ninstructing the attorney\nto change the will, her likely intention\r\nappears to have been to disinherit them.\n[30]   Similarly, the so-called ‘receipts and indemnifications’\r\nallegedly signed by the deceased in 2004 were most\nsuspicious. They\r\nsought to provide proof of payment of the purchase price reflected in\r\neach of the two forged sale agreements which\namounts, it was\r\nultimately conceded, had not in fact been paid. What led to these\r\ndocuments being prepared and signed is unknown,\nbut in the light of\r\nthe suspicious circumstances which prevailed, the attorney who\r\nappeared for the first and second defendants,\nmost correctly in my\r\nview, did not attempt to afford much weight to them and, in truth,\r\nthey take the matter no further.\n[31]   Although the fact that the deceased did not\r\ntake steps to reclaim the two portions of the farm during the 16\r\nmonth period\nfrom when she learned of the fraud until her death is to\r\nbe taken into account in considering whether she had waived such\r\nright,\na delay in exercising a right is but only one factor to be\r\ntaken into account and does not necessarily lead to an inference of\r\nits abandonment. (See eg\nMahabeer v\r\nSharma NO & another\n1985 (3) SA 729\n(A) at 736E-737C). It must also be remembered not only that the\r\ndeceased was aged and in poor health, but that she was caught up\nin a\r\nsituation of family strife with her various children making competing\r\nclaims upon her and her affection. In addition, at no\ntime during the\r\nremainder of the deceased’s lifetime did the first and second\r\ndefendants seek to exercise any de facto rights\nof ownership over any\r\npotion of the farm which the plaintiff continued to farm without\r\ninterruption. In these circumstances, the\ndeceased’s failure\r\nnot to immediately embark on litigation is understandable and is not\r\nindicative of an intention on her\npart to abandon either her rights\r\nof ownership in the two portions of the farm or her claim for them to\r\nbe transferred back to\nher.\n[32]   Taking these and the other factors\r\nmentioned by my learned colleague into account, the defence of waiver\r\nis unsustainable\non the facts and, on that basis alone, the\r\nappellant’s claim for rectification of the title deeds ought to\r\nhave succeeded.\nFor these reasons I agree that the appeal must\r\nsucceed.\n_______________\nL E LEACH\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nAppellant:\nJ\r\nG Bergenthuin SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nRooth\r\nWessels Motla Conradie\nPretoria\nRosendorff\r\nReitz Barry\nBloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent:\t\t\tZ Omar (Attorney)\nInstructed\r\nby:\nZehir\r\nOmar Attorneys\nc/o\r\nFriedland Hart & Partners\nMonument\r\nPark\nGoodrick\r\n& Franklin\nBloemfontein",

    "facts": "The deceased, John Meintjes, owned the farm Mazunga in Limpopo and, after a 1998 subdivision, bequeathed specific portions of the farm to each of her three children in a 2003 will. Before her death in January 2006, the first and second respondents fraudulently forged documents to transfer portions 2 and 3 of the farm into their own names without her knowledge or signature. The plaintiff, acting as executor of the deceased’s estate, discovered the fraud in 2004 and instituted proceedings in 2007 seeking rectification of the title deeds to reflect the estate as the true owner.",
    "issues": "The appeal centered on whether the deceased had waived or abandoned her ownership rights to portions 2 and 3 of the farm, thereby legitimising the fraudulent transfers, and whether immovable property can be transferred by way of waiver absent a deed of alienation signed in compliance with s 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act 68 of 1981.",
    "principles": "The court applied the abstract theory of transfer, requiring both registration of transfer and a real agreement (saaklike ooreenkoms) for ownership to pass. It highlighted that a valid deed of alienation is mandatory under the Alienation of Land Act, and that a waiver must be an express or unequivocal conduct communicated to the other party (Laws v Rutherfurd). Forged signatures invalidate any alleged real agreement, and public policy bars enforcement of contracts obtained through fraud.",
    "application": "The court found no genuine deed of alienation or real agreement because the transfer documents were forged. The defendants failed to prove that the deceased expressly or tacitly waived her rights; her alleged conduct, including a later will amendment, was insufficient and not communicated as a waiver. Consequently, the transfer of portions 2 and 3 was void, and rectification of the deeds in favour of the estate was warranted.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The lower court’s order was set aside. The Registrar of Deeds was ordered to cancel the fraudulent registrations of portions 2 and 3 in the names of the first and second respondents and to re‑register them in the name of the deceased’s estate. The defendants’ counter‑claim was dismissed, and they were ordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs jointly and severally."
