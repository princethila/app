The respondent, Simmer and\nJack Mines Ltd (Simmer), is a South African based company\nconducting\ngold mining operations in the country. This appeal relates to the\ninterpretation of clause 2.11 of the amended version\nof a loan\nagreement that was concluded between Simmer and Aberdeen on 6\nNovember 2006. The controversial clause 2.11 reads:\nâ\nAdditional\nConsideration.\nAs\nadditional consideration for the Facility, the Borrower agrees to\ngrant the Lender a right of first refusal for the financing of\nall of\nthe Borrowerâs properties until the Final Repayment Date, excluding\n. . .\nSubject\nto the aforementioned exclusions, in the event the Borrower seeks\nfinancing for its properties and obtains financing terms\nfrom a third\nparty before the Final Repayment Date, the Borrower shall present\nsuch terms to the Lender and the Lender shall have\na period of 60\n(sixty) days to agree to match such terms to provide financing to the\nBorrower.â\n[2]\tAberdeen\nlaunched an application in the Pretoria High Court for an order\ndeclaring that Simmer had acted in breach of the clause\nand for\nfurther ancillary relief. At issue was whether the provision for a\nright of first refusal for the financing of all Simmerâs\nproperties\ncontained in that clause was intended by the parties to include an\nissue of shares for cash. The Court below concluded\nthat it was not.\nAberdeen now appeals to this Court  with leave of the court below.\n[3]\tThe\nbackground leading to the conclusion of the agreement may be\nsummarised as follows: During 2005 the parties entered into\nnegotiations\nfor the financing by Aberdeen of two gold mines which\nSimmer intended purchasing. This culminated in a loan agreement that\nwas signed\non 30 March 2006. On 6 November 2006 the agreement was\namended for purposes not related to the present dispute and that is\nthe agreement\nthat is now in issue. Subsequent to the conclusion of\nthe agreement in 2006, Simmer issued shares for cash in order to\nraise additional\ncapital on six occasions. No objection was raised by\nAberdeen. The reason advanced for this failure by Aberdeen is that\nthey were\nnot aware of these previous issues. In June 2007 Simmer\nagain initiated a private share placement for cash to raise funding\nfor further\nexploratory and development work to be conducted in the\nmines. It is this placement that led to the present dispute.\n[4]\tIt\nis the use of the term âfinancingâ in clause 2.11 that is the\nsource of this controversy. Aberdeen contends that the term\nâfinancingâ should not be restricted to loan financing because it\nincludes equity financing such as the issue of shares by Simmer,\nand\nfurther contends that Aberdeen was consequently entitled to a right\nof first refusal in regard to these shares. Simmer contends\nthat the\nterm only refers to loan financing and not equity financing, and that\nit was therefore not obliged to offer the shares to\nAberdeen before\nit accepted the offers from successful subscribers.\n[5]\tIt\nis trite that the correct approach in interpretation of an ambiguous\nterm is to refer to its context or factual matrix.\n1\nCounsel for Aberdeen submitted that, in interpreting the clause, no\nreliance should be placed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange\nListing\nRequirements nor the Black Economic Empowerment Requirements imposed\nby the  Department of Minerals and  Energy because these\nmay not have\nbeen within the knowledge of Aberdeen, a Canadian based company. This\nsubmission has no merit. The agreement expressly\nstipulates that it\nwill be governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa and\nsubjects the parties to the jurisdiction of the\ncourts in this\ncountry. Moreover clause 3(1)(c) of the agreement contains a warranty\nto the effect that:\nâ\nThe\nexecution, delivery and performance by the Borrower [Simmer] of the\ndocuments to which it is a party and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated therein do not conflict with, result in\nany\nbreach or violation of, or constitute a default under the terms,\nconditions or provisions of the articles or by-laws of, or any\nunanimous shareholder agreement or declaration relating to the\nBorrower or\nof any\nApplicable Law binding on or applicable to the Borrower\n.â\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe definition of âApplicable\nLawâ in terms of clause 1.1 of the agreement clearly includes the\nJSE Listing Requirements and\nall other relevant regulatory rules such\nas the abovementioned Black Economic Empowerment requirements. The\nspecific reference to\nSouth African law shows that the parties\nintended to be bound by South African law and the JSE Listing\nRequirements and other regulatory\nrules must indeed be considered as\npart of the factual matrix within which clause 2.11 must be\ninterpreted.\n[6]\tThe\nagreement between the parties was a loan agreement and the clause\nshould be interpreted in that context. The right of first\nrefusal\ncontemplated in the clause means that Simmer would present to\nAberdeen whatever loan financing terms it had been offered\nby a third\nparty or third parties before accepting them. Aberdeen would in turn\nhave 60 days to consider whether they were willing\nto match the terms\nof the third party. The main problem with the interpretation\ncontended for by Aberdeen is that equity financing\noperates in a\nconverse manner. Loan financing envisages that, should it seek\nadditional finance, Simmer would approach a third party\nwho would\npropose terms of a new loan  agreement. The final decision to grant\nthe loan would be made by the third party which would\nprobably\nprescribe most of the terms. Equity financing on the other hand,\nenvisages that Simmer would issue its own shares, with\nthe authority\nof its shareholders, several interested investors would apply and\nthere would be no financing terms applicable because\nthe shares would\nbe issued for cash. The final decision to whom the shares are\nallocated and the conditions would be determined by\nSimmer without\nhaving to negotiate with any single third party.\n[7]\tThe\nlanguage used by the parties is a clear indicator that the parties \nenvisaged a loan agreement. Clause 7 of the first letter\nof intent\ndated 22 July 2005 addressed by Aberdeen to Simmer provides that\nâSimmer and Jack would grant Aberdeen a right of first\nrefusal  . .\n. such that Aberdeen would be able to enter into a similar agreement\nwith Simmer and Jack.â The use of the words âsimilar\nagreementâ\nshows that the parties contemplated a loan agreement.\n[8]\tClause\n2.10 of the agreement provides for the conversion of existing loan\nliability into shares âsubject to the approval of\nthe shareholders\nof the Borrowerâ. It can be inferred from the provisions of this\nclause that the  parties were mindful of the\nrequirement of\nshareholder approval for any issue of shares and specifically\nincluded that proviso in this clause. If it was their\nintention that\nâfinancingâ would also include equity financing they would have\nspecifically stated so in Clause 2.11 as well.\n[9]\tAny\ncontrary interpretation of this term would be unworkable in view of\nthe following further consequences that would flow from\nsuch an\ninterpretation, which could not have been intended.\n[10]\tThe\nextension of this clause to include funding by means of share capital\nwould mean that Aberdeen is given a preferential right\nto acquire the\nshares before the shareholders are able to exercise this option.\nApart from the fact that this undermines one of the\nfundamental\nrights usually reserved for shareholders, it deprives them of the\nright to decide the conditions applicable to the allocation\nof such\nshares. Aberdeen would have a preferential right to that of the\nshareholders and would be at liberty to acquire the shares\nbefore the\nshareholders are able to exercise this option. The practical effect\nof this is that the shareholding of Simmer would inevitably\nbe\ndiluted. Such dilution would occur beyond the control of the\nshareholders because if they  made  a contrary decision in a general\nmeeting, they would be acting contrary to the terms of the agreement\nconcluded on their behalf by the directors of the company. It\nis\nunlikely that the directors would have agreed to restrict the\nshareholdersâ rights at the behest of a creditor, without having\nsought  an agreement by the shareholders at a general meeting.\n[11]\tIt\nwas not disputed that Simmer was bound to comply with Black Economic\nEmpowerment (BEE) requirements. The dilution caused by\na preferential\nissuing of shares to Aberdeen would lower the BEE shareholding below\nthe minimum requirements stipulated by the Department\nof Minerals and\nEnergy. This in turn would jeopardise the mining rights of Simmer,\nthe acquisition of which was premised on a minimum\nBEE shareholding.\nThat this was a major concern is evident from the fact that this\ndisputed private share placement was heavily oversubscribed\nand the\nallocation had to be made in such a manner that non-BEE subscribers\nwere allocated 7% of their request and the BEE subscribers\n90% of\ntheir requests to ensure that the BEE shareholding remained above\n26%.\n[12]\t\nVarious listing requirements place limitations on the issue of shares\nfor cash. Any issue of shares for cash would have to comply\nwith the\nlisting requirements of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which the\nJSE exercises in terms of the\nSecurities Services Act 36 of 2004\n.\nSection 5.52(d)\nof the JSE listing requirements provides:\nâ\nThe\nmaximum discount at which equity securities may be issued is 10% of\nthe weighted average traded price of such equity securities\nmeasured\nover the 30 business days prior to the date that the price of the\nissue is determined or agreed by the directors of the\nissuer. The JSE\nshould be consulted for a ruling if the applicantâs securities have\nnot traded in such 30 business day period.â\nThe\n60 day period given to the applicant to exercise its right of first\nrefusal would render\nsection 5.52(d)\nineffective because an\nacceptance later than the 30 day period, even if within the 60 day\ngrace period given to Aberdeen, would be\ncontrary to the provisions\nof this section and would require approval by the JSE. If the parties\nintended to deviate from this listing\nrequirement, they would have\nspecifically provided for this in the agreement. This is so because\nthe stipulated 30 day period is\nto prevent manipulation of the share\nmarket and to safeguard the interests of existing shareholders. It is\nunlikely that the JSE\nwould readily grant such approval.\n[13]\tIt\nfollows from the above that clause 2.11, seen in context and with\nregard to the relevant âfactual matrixâ does not apply\nto equity\nfinancing but to loan financing. Simmer therefore did not breach\nclause 2.11 and the appeal must fail. I make the following\norder:\nThe\nappeal is dismissed with costs including the costs of two counsel.\n____________________\nZ\nL L TSHIQI\nJUDGE\nOF APPEAL\nA\nppearances:\nAPPELLANT\n:\tB\nH Swart SC (with him K W LÃ¼deritz)\nInstructed\nby Couzyn Hertzog & Horak, Pretoria;\nSchoeman\nMaree Attorneys, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT\n:\tW\nTrengove SC (with him W la Grange)\nInstructed\nby\tRoutledge Modise Attorneys, c/o Jacobson & Levy Inc, Pretoria;\nHoney\nAttorneys, Bloemfontein\n1\nKPMG Chartered Accountants (SA) v Securefin Ltd & another\n2009 (4) SA 399\nSCA.",

    "facts": "Aberdeen International Incorporated, a Canadian financier, entered into a loan agreement with Simmer and Jack Mines Ltd, a South African gold miner, on 30 March 2006, later amended on 6 November 2006. Clause 2.11 of the agreement gave Aberdeen a right of first refusal on any financing of Simmer’s properties, subject to exclusions. After the amendment, Simmer raised capital on six occasions by issuing shares for cash without objection from Aberdeen. In June 2007 Simmer initiated a private share placement to fund further exploration, prompting Aberdeen to claim that the term “financing” in clause 2.11 also covered equity financing, thereby giving it a right of first refusal over the new shares.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was whether the word “financing” in clause 2.11 was to be understood as encompassing equity financing (share issues) as well as loan financing, which would entitle Aberdeen to a right of first refusal over the shares issued by Simmer.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the established rule that an ambiguous contractual term must be interpreted in its factual matrix, considering the contract’s context, purpose, and relevant regulatory framework (JSE Listing Requirements and BEE legislation). It emphasized that the loan agreement context and the parties’ expressed intent, as reflected in related clauses and the original letter of intent, guide the meaning of “financing.”",
    "application": "Examining clause 2.11 alongside clause 2.10 (which expressly deals with conversion of loan liability into shares) and the 22 July 2005 letter of intent, the Court found that the parties intended the right of first refusal to apply only to loan financing. The inclusion of equity financing would conflict with shareholder rights, BEE compliance, and JSE listing rules, making such an interpretation commercially and legally untenable. Consequently, the term “financing” was confined to loan arrangements.",
    "conclusion": "The Court held that clause 2.11 does not cover equity financing; Simmer did not breach the agreement. The appeal by Aberdeen was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel."
