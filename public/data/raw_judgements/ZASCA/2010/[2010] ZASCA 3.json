This makes it necessary to set out the\nrelevant background facts in some detail and, in so far as they may\nbe disputed,\nI will apply the test laid down in\nPlascon-Evans\nPaints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd\n.\n1\n[3]\nThe main\nprotagonists are the second appellant, PS Booksellers, and the first\nrespondent, Harrison, who are neighbours. PS Booksellers\nis the\nregistered owner of Erf 594, which is its principal place of business\nsituate diagonally opposite the property. Harrison is\na property\ndeveloper and the registered owner of the property which she acquired\nin September 2004 for development and resale. The\nlitigation arose\nfrom the appellantsâ objections to building operations she\ncommenced on the property, which allegedly contravened\nthe applicable\nmunicipal zoning scheme and restrictive title deed conditions (which\nare discussed later in the judgment) in respect\nof building set-back\nand height requirements.\n[4\n]\t On 24 January 2005,\nthe municipality approved Harrisonâs building plans under Plan No.\n480217 (the original plan) which depicts\na three-storey residential\ndwelling with a swimming pool on a plot measuring 427m\n2\nin extent. The storeys are designated âUpper Ground Floorâ,\nâFirst Floorâ and âSecond Floorâ. According to this plan\nthe\nproperty is situated at the corner of Geneva Drive and Blinkwater\nRoad. Its topography slopes from Blinkwater Road down towards\nGeneva\nDrive. It has an open parking area with access from Blinkwater Road.\nThere is another open parking area and a basement garage\non the side\nof Geneva Drive designated âLower Ground floorâ which, because of\nthe steeply sloping nature of the property, are\nat a significantly\nlower level than the parking facilities off Blinkwater Road.\n[5]\t Building operations commenced in March,\nshortly after the original planâs approval. However, the appellants\nobjected to the\nconstruction. After the objections were raised, a\nchain of correspondence flowed between the appellants and Harrison in\nan attempt\nto reach a compromise. In consequence, Harrison submitted\na substantially revised plan which the municipality approved under\nPlan\nNo. 485042 (the September 2005 plan). The appellants were\nnonetheless not satisfied that their concerns had been addressed. In\nNovember\n2005, they instituted an application to interdict any\nfurther building operations on the property and its sale, transfer or\nalienation\npending (a) an appeal to be launched in terms of s 62 of\nthe Local Government: Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 (the Systems\nAct)\n2\nagainst the approval of the September 2005 plan, (b) an application\nfor the demolition of any construction which contravenes the\ntitle\ndeed conditions and (c) certain review proceedings.\n3\n[6\n]\t The principal issue\nin the application (as in the s 62 appeal which followed) concerned a\nwall which included a large planter and\na swimming pool water\nreticulation system constructed along the western side of the\nproperty on the Geneva Drive boundary which continues\non the eastern\nside of the property on the Blinkwater Road street boundary to which\nportion of the dwelling abuts on. The appellants\ncomplained that it\nwas not merely a boundary wall but was designed to support not only\nthe swimming pool and the planter but also\nto retain a substantial\namount of fill material deposited and compacted behind it to its full\nheight. This, they contended, contravened\nclause D(d) of a reciprocal\nrestrictive title deed condition registered in favour of every owner\nof an erf in Camps Bay under the\nprovisions of s 18(3) of Ordinance\n33 of 1934 (the Ordinance), which is applicable to the partiesâ\nrespective properties. The clause\nprohibits the erection of a\nâbuilding or structure or any portion thereof, except boundary\nwalls and fences ... nearer than 3.15\nmetres to the street line which\nforms a boundaryâ of an erf.\n[7]\nThe appellants also\nargued that the âfinishedâ ground level abutting the dwelling\nfrom which the dwellingâs height was to\nbe measured had been\nachieved by unlawful manipulation. This was so, they contended,\nbecause the retaining wall impermissibly altered\nthe finished ground\nlevel adjacent to the facades of the dwelling, which was artificially\nraised by some 3,5 metres, and disguised\nthe height of such facades\nthus enabling Harrison to construct a dwelling to a height in excess\nof the restriction of 10 metres prescribed\nby the applicable\nprovisions of s 98(2) of the Zoning Scheme Regulations (the Zoning\nScheme).\n4\n[\n8]\t In April 2006, the\nappellants obtained the interdict which remains in operation.\n5\nThis relief was granted on the basis that the retaining walls\nreflected in the September 2005 plan indeed contravened clause D(d)\nand that, prima facie, they artificially raised the finished ground\nlevel by retaining fill material compacted behind them and\nreconfigured\nthe original steep slope in the property to an almost\nhorizontal platform thus concealing an infringement of the relevant\nheight\nrestriction.\n[9]\nThe s 62 appeal\nwhich the appellants duly lodged thereafter was also decided in their\nfavour on the same basis as the interdict\nproceedings. The September\n2005 plan was accordingly set aside. The appellants went further and\ninstituted an application for the\ndemolition of the dwelling, a shell\nof a three-storey structure built in accordance with the original\nplan. That application currently\nstands over by the partiesâ\nagreement pending the finalisation of the review proceedings which\nare the subject of this appeal.\n[\n10] \tPrior to the\nfinalisation of the s 62 appeal, Harrison had meanwhile submitted for\nthe municipalityâs approval a further plan\nas a rider to the\noriginal plan. (As to which plan this document was meant to be a\nrider is a point of hot dispute as the appellants\ncontend that it was\nintended to be a rider to the defunct September 2005 plan but I deal\nwith this aspect later.) This plan was also\nmet with written\nobjections from the appellants but after further revisions, on 6\nSeptember 2007, it was approved by the municipalityâs\nDevelopment\nCo-ordinator, Mr Holden, on the written recommendation of Mr Moir,\nthe municipalityâs Building Control Officer, under\nplan 506011 (the\nplan). This is the impugned decision which the appellants seek to\nhave reviewed and set aside.\n[11]\nIn the planâs\nfinal version the swimming pool is in a different, uncontentious\nposition. The planter and other garden landscaping\nfeatures and\nstructures erected to provide access to the parking space and the\nfront door have been omitted altogether. The walls\nalong the northern\nand western boundaries of the property previously retaining the\nswimming pool and the planter thus no longer serve\na retaining\nfunction to those structures. The âsandbag wallâ running from the\ncorner of the garage to the Geneva Drive boundary\nand intersecting\nthe main boundary wall which retained some soil has been removed.\nFill material between the boundary wall and the\nfacade of the\ndwelling has also been removed. The plan shows contours in this area\nwhich, according to Moir, is an indication of\na âfallâ and the\nabsence of fill material thus leaving nothing to be retained by the\nremaining wall. The appellants confirm the\nremoval of these objects\nbut persist that the exposure of the facades by the removal of fill\nmaterial has served to reveal an infringement\nof the 10 metre height\nrestriction and that the remaining boundary walls still retain\ncompacted fill material. The plan further shows\nan embankment along\nthe northern side and the boundary wall measuring a compliant height\nof 2,1 metres.\n[1\n2]\t The appellantsâ\ngrounds of review in their founding papers were framed as follows:\nâ\n[1]  The\nbuildings as contemplated by the plans approved by the [municipality]\nin plan no. 506011, will contravene both the title\ndeed conditions\napplicable to the property and also the provisions of the zoning\nscheme applicable to the area in which the property\nis situated;\n[2]  The\n[municipality], when considering the application for plan approval,\nfailed to give due consideration to the objections lodged\nby the\n[appellants] against the approval of such plans;\n[3] The [municipality] and its\nofficials committed material errors of law and misdirected themselves\nas to the true nature of elements\nof the proposed building, when\nconsidering the plan for approval;\n28.4 The [municipality]âs\nofficials had regard to irrelevant considerations and failed to have\ndue regard to relevant considerations\nâ more particularly the\nfacts, information and objections before them â when considering\nthe plan for approval.â\n[13\n] \tThese grounds, as\ndeveloped in the appellantsâ affidavits, turned on the legality of\nthe plan, ie the alleged infringement of\nthe height restriction\nimposed by the Zoning Scheme and the set-back requirements set out in\nthe title deed; the competence of the\ndelegated authority to the\ndecision-maker who approved the original plan (this ground was not\npursued on appeal) and the procedural\nfairness or otherwise of the\ndecision to approve the plan in relation to the manner in which the\napplication was scrutinised, particularly\nthe municipalityâs\nalleged failure to identify unlawful features and consider the\nappellantsâ objections. The appellants subsequently\nadded further\ngrounds in their replying affidavits, namely that (a) the plan also\ncontravened s 47(1) of the Zoning Scheme and (b)\nthe approval of the\nplan as a rider to a previously approved plan was incompetent.\n[1\n4] \tThe court below\nrefused to entertain the challenge relating to s 47(1) of the\nZoning Scheme mainly on the basis that it had\nbeen raised late (in\nreply) and was as a result not adequately canvassed in the papers.\nThe court then dismissed all the other grounds\nof review and found,\ninter alia, that even if the approval process was not fair because\nMoirâs memorandum did not adequately reflect\nthe appellantsâ\nobjections, it would not be just and equitable to set the plan\napproval aside solely for that reason. In its view,\nthe municipality\nhad correctly decided that the plan complies with all the relevant\nlegal provisions and no purpose would be served\nby remitting the\nmatter for fresh consideration.\n[\n15]\t Before us, the\nappellants contested the decision of the court below on the same\ngrounds but added more: that\n(a) the\nmunicipality did not pay due regard to the objections raised by\ninterested parties on the basis of derogation in value of\ntheir\nproperties under s 7(1)(a) and (1)(b)(ii) of the Building Standards\nAct when it considered the plan; (b) the municipality failed\nto\nfurnish the decision-maker, Holden, with a building control officerâs\nrecommendation\nand (c) the court below\nwrongly exercised its discretion in refusing the review having\nregard, inter alia, to the fact that the municipality\nand the court\nitself did not consider a number of issues relating to whether the\napplication complied with relevant law, bearing\nin mind that the\ndoctrine of legality does not countenance invalid administrative\nacts.\n[16] \tIt is convenient to set out the legal\nframework within which the matter falls to be decided before I deal\nwith the partiesâ\ncontentions. The relevant and principal statutory\nprovisions are provided by the Building Standards Act the objective\nof which is\nto promote uniformity in the law relating to the erection\nof buildings within local authorities. Section 4(1) requires the\nlocal\nauthorityâs written approval of a landownerâs application\ncomprising of building plans and specifications prior to the\nconstruction\nof a building. Section 5 enjoins every local authority\nto appoint a building control officer. This is a key official without\nwhom\na local authority may not function,\n6\nwho must be skilled and specialized\n7\nand is vested with wide-ranging powers in the exercise of building\napproval and development within a local authority which are set\nout\nin s 6. Section 6(1)(a) obliges him or her to âmake recommendations\nto the local authority in question, regarding any plans,\nspecifications, documents and information submitted to such local\nauthority in accordance with s 4(3)â.\n8\n[\n17] \tSection 7\nregulates the approval of building plans. Its provisions empower a\nlocal authority to grant an application if satisfied\nthat the\napplication complies with the requirements of the Building Standards\nAct and stipulates the circumstances in which an application\nwill be\nrefused. The material provisions are couched in s 7(1) which reads:\nâ\nIf a local\nauthority, having considered a recommendation referred to in section\n6(1)\n(a)\nâ\nis satisfied that the\n\tapplication in question complies with the requirements of this Act\n\tand any other applicable law, it shall\ngrant its approval in respect\n\tthereof;\n(i) is not so satisfied; or\nis satisfied that the building\n\t\tto which the application in question relates â\n(aa)\nis to be erected in such manner or will be of such nature or\nappearance that â\n(aaa)\nthe area in which it is to be erected will probably or\nin fact be\ndisfigured thereby;\n(bbb)\nit will probably or in fact be unsightly or\nobjectionable;\n(ccc)\nit will probably or in fact derogate from the value of\nadjoining\nor neighbouring properties;\n(bb)\nwill probably or in fact be dangerous to life or \t\t\t\t\t     \nproperty,\nsuch local authority shall refuse to grant its \t\t\t\t\t     \napproval in respect  thereof and give written \t\t\t\t\t      reasons for\nsuch refusal;\nProvided that the local\nauthority shall grant or refuse, as the case may be, its approval in\nrespect of any application where the\narchitectural area of the\nbuilding to which the application relates is less than 500 square\nmetres, within a period of 30 days after\nreceipt of the application\nand, where the architectural area of such building is 500 square\nmetres or larger, within a period of\n60 days after receipt of the\napplication.â\n[18\n] \tI turn to deal\nwith each of the grounds of review.\nThe a\nlleged\nfailure by the decision-maker (Holden) to consider the appellantsâ\nobjections under s 7(1)(a) and (1)(b)(ii) of the Building\nStandards\nAct\n[19\n] \tIt was contended\nfor the appellants that they duly lodged an objection that the\nproposed building would derogate from the value\nof neighbouring\nproperties, including Erf 594, which both Moir and Holden were\nobliged to consider; that Moir failed to inform Holden\nof the\nobjection by furnishing him with a copy of the document in which it\nwas embodied or a fair and accurate summary thereof, as\nhe was\nobliged, and that such failure â to place statutorily relevant\ninformation before the decision-maker â nullified Holdenâs\napproval of the plan. The objection was purportedly embodied in two\nletters dated 27 October 2006\n9\nand 15 January 2007,\n10\nrespectively, and an affidavit filed in support of the appellantsâ\nfounding papers which was deposed to on the latter date by Mr\nvan der\nSpuy, a sworn valuer. Van Der Spuyâs brief affidavit, one of a\nnumber of documents attached to the founding affidavits,\nmerely\nstated without proffering any supporting facts that the basis for\ndetermining Erf 594âs market value was the armâs length\nprice\nwhich he estimated a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an\nopen market situation and that the dwelling, described\nas âimposing\nand somewhat overbearingâ, would substantially derogate from the\nmarket value of Erf 594 if permitted to stand.\n[20]\t The appellantsâ submissions in this regard\nmay, in my view, be disposed of shortly. The issue of derogation of\nvalue was not\npertinently raised as a ground of review in the court\nbelow. The passing reference to the issue in the letters of objection\nand Van\nDer Spuyâs affidavit to which no weight can be accorded\nremained merely that, and no more, as the allegations were not\nadopted\nin the founding affidavit to found a ground of review on\nwhich the appellants relied. The respondents, who could well have\nraised\na solid defence, were therefore not required to address these\ndocuments and rightly did not address the issue in their opposing\naffidavits.\nNotably, the ground was not mentioned at all in the\ncomprehensive judgment of the court below which scrupulously listed\nthose argued\nbefore it. The appellantsâ counsel was also\nconstrained to concede, albeit reluctantly, that the ground was\nrather canvassed in\nthe demolition application which was not before\nus and was not âdealt with as a separate and distinct groundâ in\nthese proceedings.\n[21\n] \tThe appellants\ntherefore seek, at appeal stage, to rely on a ground that they not\nonly failed to establish in their founding papers\nbut was not\ncanvassed at all in the court below. This is impermissible. As Cloete\nJA pointed out in\nMinister of Land\nAffairs and Agriculture v D & F Wevell Trust\n:\n11\nâ\nIt is not proper for a party in motion\nproceedings to base an argument on passages in documents which have\nbeen annexed to the papers\nwhen the conclusions sought to be drawn\nfrom such passages have not been canvassed in the affidavits. The\nreason is manifest â\nthe other party may well be prejudiced because\nevidence may have been available to it to refute the new case on the\nfacts. The position\nis worse where the arguments are advanced for the\nfirst time on appeal. In motion proceedings, the affidavits\nconstitute both the\npleadings and the evidence: ... and the issues\nand averments in support of the partiesâ cases should appear\nclearly therefrom.\nA party cannot be expected to trawl through\nlengthy annexures to the opponentâs affidavit and to speculate on\nthe possible relevance\nof facts therein contained. Trial by ambush\ncannot be permitted.â\nThis review ground must, therefore, fail.\nThe a\nlleged\nfailure by the municipality to provide the decision-maker with a\nrecommendation from the Building Control Officer as contemplated\nby\nsections 6 and 7 of the Building Standards  Act\n[22\n] \tThe appellantsâ\nattack in this regard was based on the ground that the memorandum\nMoir submitted to Holden was not a recommendation\nas envisaged by\nsections 6 and 7 of the Building Standards Act because it, inter\nalia, (a) did not fairly or accurately summarise\ntheir objections to\nthe plan and was in certain respects factually incorrect, (b) did not\ninform Holden, even in summary, of all\ntheir objections particularly\nthose relating to the infringement of the height restrictions and\nderogation of value of neighbouring\nproperties, (c) contained\ninsufficient information such as would enable Holden to independently\nmake a rational decision on the application\nbefore him and (e) showed\nthat Moir himself failed to appreciate the nature of the objections\nor left out information he thought\nhad no merit thus arrogating\nhimself a discretion he did not have. Reliance for this proposition\nwas placed on the\nWalele\n12\ndecision\nwhich we were advised was delivered\nafter the matter was argued before the court below but before\njudgment was given.\n[23] \tAs with the derogation of value argument\ndealt with above, the contention that Moirâs memorandum was not a\nproper recommendation\nwas not one of the review grounds in the\nappellantsâ affidavits; it was raised for the first time in their\nheads of argument in\nthis court. I am not inclined to lend it any\ncredence for the same reason that I refused to entertain the\nderogation of value point.\nAs I have said, it would be prejudicial to\nthe municipality if the appellants were allowed to advance a new\nissue on appeal which\nwas not raised in their founding affidavits and\nwhich the municipality did not have an opportunity to deal with in\nits opposing affidavit.\nBut I will consider the question whether or\nnot the municipality gave due regard to relevant considerations and\nthe appellantsâ\nobjections as that is what was canvassed in the\naffidavits.\n[24\n] \tThat Holdenâs\ndecision constituted administrative action as defined by the\nPromotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000\n(PAJA), which is\nconstitutionally required to be lawful, reasonable and procedurally\nfair,\n13\nwas not in dispute. As pointed out, the appellantsâ main complaint\nin their papers was that the municipalityâs officials did\nnot have\ndue regard to their objections which the municipality denied.\nAlthough there was no statutory obligation on the municipality\nto\nafford the appellants an opportunity to make representations about\nthe impact the proposed building might have on their properties,\n14\nit nevertheless commendably invited PS Booksellersâ input. Once it\ndid so, it was enjoined to consider the appellantsâ\nrepresentations.\nA determination of whether such representations were\nproperly considered requires an examination of the procedure followed\nin the\napproval process.\n[25\n]\t Undisputed\nevidence is that the exercise, which was undertaken by various\ndepartments within the municipality, took the following\nsequence. On\n2 June 2006 the Land Information Property Management Department\ngranted the necessary clearance after verifying and\nconfirming\ncadastral boundary measurements, title deed information, servitude\nand road widening information. On 17 August 2006 Messrs\nNapoli (a\nPrincipal Plans Examiner) and September (the Section Head) of the\nmunicipalityâs Land Use Management Department granted\nclearance\nafter verifying and confirming that the plan was consistent with the\nZoning Scheme Regulations, including height restrictions\nand building\nlines. These officials had sight of and considered the actual letters\nof objection before endorsing the plan. Structural\nengineering\nacceptance indicating that structural certification was in order had\nbeen granted by the Plans Examiner who, after assessing\nthat the\napplication complied with the Building Standards Act and other\nrelevant laws, submitted it to Moir.\n[26\n]\t Moir then\nrequested Harrison and her experts to address him on the merits of\nthose objections. He subsequently requested further\ninformation from\nher in response to which the municipality received correspondence\nfrom Messrs Lewis (a land surveyor) and Labrum\n(a structural\nengineer). After considering these responses Moir referred the plans\nto Mr Henshall-Howard, the municipalityâs Building\nDevelopment\nManagement Head, on 5 June 2007, and thereafter, on 17 August 2007,\nhe passed them on to September to consider the certificate\nfrom\nLabrum for further verification and clearance. According to Moir, he\ndid not only consider the objections and all the information\nplaced\nbefore him but also inspected the property before compiling his\nmemorandum which included a summary of the objections. It\nis that\nmemorandum and the approval document which made reference to the\ndifferent departmental clearances that Holden relied on\nin granting\nthe approval.\n[27\n] \tIn his affidavit,\nHolden stated that in reaching his decision he relied on the facts,\nopinions and advice provided to him by Moir\nand the other in-house\nexperts who scrutinised the application. He said that he considered\nthe information furnished by Moir adequate\nand was satisfied that the\nappellantsâ objections â the memorandum recorded that the\nobjections included that the proposed building\ncontravened the title\ndeed conditions; that the levels furnished by the land surveyor were\nincorrect and that the embankment around\nthe dwelling would become\nunstable â which were âclearly and properly conveyedâ (as\nconfirmed by a later, thorough perusal\nof the original letters of\nobjection) had no merit and that the plan met the statutory\nrequirements. He reached this conclusion after\ngiving particular\nattention to the fact that the application had been revised to comply\nwith the title deed conditions and the Zoning\nScheme; Labrumâs\nadvice that the building was founded at undisturbed ground level and\ndid not rely on any fill against the boundary\nfor support; that the\nwalls encroaching the title deed requirements could be removed and\nresponsible landscaping would not affect\nthe structure; the opinion\nof the experienced and reputable Lewis that the levels were correct\nand no point of the building would\nexceed the prescribed 10 metre\nheight level above the finished ground level and Moirâs advice that\nnone of the statutory requirements\nwould be infringed. (These were\nthe very issues at the heart of the appellantsâ case which\nessentially concerns the height levels\nand building lines of the\nproposed building.)\n[28] \tThere is, generally, nothing improper about\nsuch conduct, as a decision-maker may rely on the expertise and\nadvice of officials\nwithin his or her institution as long as he or\nshe is fully apprised of the interested partiesâ representations â\nan accurate\nsummary containing a fair synopsis of the relevant\nevidence and such representations will generally suffice â and does\nnot abdicate\nthe responsibility of independently assessing the\napplication and making the ultimate decision.\n15\n[29]\nIt appears to me on\nthis evidence that all the necessary protocols were scrupulously\nobserved by the relevant officials and due regard\npaid to the\nappellantsâ concerns in the approval process. I cannot conceive\nwhat more could have been done to render the process\nfair. As I see\nit, Holden was entitled to rely on Moirâs memorandum and the\naccompanying document in the manner he did. This must\nbe so, bearing\nin mind that the building control officerâs recommendation is\nintended to be the decision-makerâs primary source\nof information\nwhich forms the basis of his or her opinion.\n16\nAs the court put it in the\nWalele\ndecision â[t]he discretion conferred\non the decision-maker is highly circumscribed because the decision\ntaken is reliant upon the\nantecedent opinion reached ... upon a\nconsideration of the [building control officerâs] recommendation.â\n17\n[30\n] \tThe question\nwhether the action complained of causes prejudice is important in\ndeciding whether or not to grant the relief sought.\nNone seems to\nhave been occasioned here by reason of the procedure followed.\nBearing in mind that what constitutes a fair administrative\nprocedure\ndepends on the circumstances of each case,\n18\nI am unable to find that such procedure is so flawed as to vitiate\nthe decision to approve the plan.\nThe alleged unlawfulness of the approval of the plan as a rider\nplan\n[31\n] \tThe appellants\npersisted with their argument in the court below that the Building\nStandards Act makes no provision for the concept\nof a rider plan and\nthat\nthe municipality therefore\nimpermissibly approved the plan as a rider plan to a previously\napproved plan\n. They contended further that\nthe plan was in any event approved as an amended version of and a\nrider to the defunct September 2005\nplan, a fact which alone rendered\nits approval incompetent.\n[32\n] \tI deal first with\nthe latter submission. The plan expressly states on its face that it\nwas approved as a rider to the original\nplan. The Moir memorandum\nreferred to it as such as did the parties themselves in the founding\nand opposing affidavits. As pointed\nout by the appellants in their\nreplying papers, Holdenâs approval document referred to it as a\nrider to the September 2005 plan,\nperhaps because the latter plan was\nthe most recently approved plan and still subsisted when the plan was\napproved on 2 June 2006.\nBut, whatever the reason for this obvious\nerror was, I do not think that it can detract from the patent fact\nthat the municipality\napproved the plan as a rider to the original\nplan.\n[33\n] \tConcerning the\nfirst contention, i\nt is so that the\nBuilding Standards Act makes no mention of a rider plan. However, s\n17(1) empowers the Minister to make regulations\nregarding, inter\nalia, âthe preparation, submission and approval of plans and\nspecifications of buildings, including the approval\nof amendments or\nalterations to plans and specifications of buildings during the\nerection thereofâ. In consequence, Regulation\nA25(5) criminalizes\ndeviation from an approved plan building âexcept where such\ndeviation has been approvedâ. Regulation A25(6)\nthen empowers a\nlocal authority to stop the erection of a building where there is an\nunauthorized deviation from approved plans during\nthe course of\nconstruction, except where it is found that the deviation is\nnecessary, in which case construction may be allowed to\ncontinue\nsubject to the submission of an amended plan for approval.\n[34] \tThese provisions undoubtedly contemplate a\ndeviation from an approved plan and the submission and approval of an\namended plan,\ndrawing or particulars to cater for such a deviation\nwhere necessary. At a practical level, according to Moirâs\nuncontested allegations,\nthe municipality routinely receives and\nprocesses applications for the approval of additional or\nsupplementary plans (commonly referred\nto as rider plans) amending or\nqualifying a previously approved plan whenever a deviation from such\napproved plan becomes necessary\nduring the construction of a\nbuilding.\n[3\n5] \tI am inclined to\nagree with the court below that the Legislature would hardly have\nvested the Minister with the authority to make\nprovisions of this\nnature if local authorities did not have the implied power to approve\namendments or alterations to approved plans\nin terms of the governing\nprovisions contained in s 7 of the Building Standards Act. It seems\nto me that to give effect to the Legislatureâs\nclear intention, the\nplans, specifications and documents required to accompany an\napplication in respect of the erection of a building\nby s 4 of this\nAct (the wording appears to envisage the possibility of a plurality\nof plans per application) must necessarily include\namended or rider\nplans. In the circumstances, I find that the plan was a rider to the\noriginal plan and that its approval was not\nultra\nvires\nthe provisions of the Building\nStandards Act.\nThe alleged contravention of title\ndeed\nconditions\n[\n36] \tAs indicated\nabove, the appellantsâ other complaint is that the plan\nimpermissibly allows retaining walls which encroach on\nthe 3,15 metre\nsetback to the street line and form a boundary to the property in\ncontravention of clause D(d) of the applicable restrictive\ntitle deed\nconditions. Although this issue does not appear to have been pursued\nwith any vigour or at all in argument in the court\nbelow the\nappellants insist that the infringing walls remain in the original\nplan and are depicted on the plan. According to Moir,\nthe walls along\nthe northern and western boundaries of the property no longer serve a\nretaining purpose but mark the boundary walls\nof the property. Only\nthe\nwall abutting Blinkwater Road serves a\nretaining function. But, he says that this wall supports only a\nmunicipal public footway incidentally\nand this, the municipality\ncontends, does not infringe the relevant requirements but places it\nin line with clause D(g) of the title\ndeed provisions imposing\nfavourable conditions in the municipalityâs favour against property\nowners.\n19\n[37] \tIt must be considered that the main\nobjective of the title deed conditions, which were introduced in the\nabsence of comprehensive\ntown planning legislation, was to regulate\ndevelopment and usage of land between developers and the purchasers\nand owners of individual\nerven and their successors-in-title. The\npurpose of this particular setback restriction must obviously have\nbeen to prevent property\nowners from building too close to the street\nlines. That does not seem to have happened here. No building or\nstructure encroaches\non the 3,15m setback as the wall in issue does\nnot retain any ground or structure on the property itself. It merely\nperforms a boundary\nfunction as it encloses an open space,\n20\nwhich is permitted by the restriction, and benefits the municipality\non a portion of the latterâs land external to the property.\nIt\nseems inconceivable that this was the contemplated target of the\nrestriction and I can find no transgression of the provisions\nof\nclause D(d).\nThe alleged contravention of s 98 of the Zoning Scheme in\nrespect of the 10 metre height restriction\n[3\n8] \tIn support of this\nground, the appellants contended\nthat\nHarrison artificially raised the ground level on the property to\nevade the height restriction by using fictitious ground levels\nin the\nplan as evidenced by the differences between the levels shown in the\nsurvey and the architectâs drawings in the plan.\n[39\n]\nSection\n98 of the Zoning Scheme provides:\nâ\nCamps Bay and Bakoven\n(1) No\nbuilding within the area of Camps Bay and Bakoven bounded by the\nmunicipal boundary to the South and Kloof Road to the North\nshall\nexceed three storeys in height.\n(2) No point on the faÃ§ade of\nany building within such area shall be more than 10m above the level\nof the ground abutting such faÃ§ade\nimmediately below such point.\n(3) For the\npurpose of subsection (2) âfaÃ§adeâ means a main containing wall\nof a building, other than a wall of an internal courtyard.â\n[40\n] \tLewis deposed to\nan affidavit recording his findings. He prepared a survey map in\nSeptember 2004 on which he subsequently superimposed\nthe plan. In his\nview, the heights of the contour lines in the plan were accurate as\nthey accorded with his earlier survey and corresponded\nwith those\nreflected in the original plan. These findings were supported by\nanother land surveyor, Mr Abrahamse, who undertook an\nindependent\nsurvey at Harrisonâs instance. Abrahamse confirmed that a survey of\nthe finished ground level surrounding and immediately\nadjoining the\ndwelling revealed that no point of the faÃ§ade of the dwelling was\nmore than 10 metres above the level of the ground.\nAnother expert, Mr\nLowden, a civil engineer specializing in structural engineering\nengaged by the municipality, found amongst other\nthings that âthe\nfoundations of the dwelling are founded at an appropriate level and\nthat the building structure is not dependent\non the construction of\nany retaining walls to provide stability to the foundationsâ.\n[41\n] \tThe appellantsâ\nresponse to these expertsâ allegations in their replying papers was\nthat their objection was ânever that\nthe height from the top to the\nbottom of the parapet [of the dwelling] to the ground immediately\nabutting the faÃ§ade as currently\nshown on the plan exceeds 10\nmetresâ but that âthe true height of the faÃ§ade, absent the\nillegal structures and the fill retained\nthereby, will and does\nexceed 10 metresâ.\n[42\n] \tIt is clear from\nthese allegations that the appellants accept that the dwelling\nreflected in the plan falls within the permissible\nheight restriction\nand that their complaint concerns rather the dwelling that has\nactually been constructed. In that case the appellants\ncannot\nchallenge the approval of the plan on the basis they have advanced\nnamely; that the municipality approved a plan that permits\na dwelling\nthat infringes the 10 metre height restriction imposed by s 98 of the\nZoning Scheme. It did not. That, I think, puts paid\nto this review\nground.\n[43] \tIt is not necessary in the light of this\nfinding to determine whether or not the height of the actual dwelling\nis compliant,\nan exercise I suspect may prove unwinnable for the\nappellants on the available evidence. The Building Standards Act does\nprovide\nfor a situation where a building has been built contrary to\napproved plans but that enquiry (which is probably the subject of the\npending demolition application) falls outside the purview of these\nproceedings.\nThe alleged contravention of s 47 of the Zoning Scheme in\nrespect of setback requirements\n[\n44]\t The court below\ndeclined to consider this ground of review on the grounds that it was\nraised too late in the proceedings and\nthat the required\ninterpretation of s 47 was highly controversial as it involved the\nmeasurement of the average depth of the site\nand the scrutiny of the\nrelationship, if any, between the relevant regulation and the title\ndeed conditions; issues which, in its\nview, had not been properly\ncanvassed in the papers.\n[45\n] \tI am of the\nrespectful view that the courtâs refusal to entertain the matter\nwas wrong. This, however, is an appeal against the\nexercise of\nanother courtâs discretion in the strict or narrow sense which\ninvolves a choice between permissible options. The approach\nto be\nfollowed by this court, therefore, is not to consider whether the\ndecision of the court was correct or not and substitute its\ndecision\nsimply because it would have reached a different conclusion: it may\ninterfere only where it is shown that the discretion\nwas not\nexercised judicially or was exercised based on a wrong appreciation\nof principles of law or a misdirection on the facts or\nreached a\ndecision that could not reasonably have been made on the relevant\nfacts and principles.\n21\n[46]\nIn my view, the\nbasis on which the courtâs decision was premised indicates a\nmisapprehension of both the relevant principles and\nthe facts and\nthat the court may even have misconceived the very nature of the\nenquiry. First, the matter was raised purely as a\nlaw point. The\ndispute raised was not fact-based (the relevant boundaries of the\nsite, setbacks and measurements represented on the\nplans which seem\nto have caused the court below some anxiety were common cause) but\nconcerned only the interpretation and application\nof statutory\nprovisions. It did not alter the legal basis upon which the\nappellants relied or the ambit of the relief sought. Furthermore,\nthe\nappellants alleged no prejudice â the foremost consideration in a\ncourtâs exercise of its discretion as to whether or not\nto\nentertain a belated point\n22\nâ and were in fact able to deal with the issues fully in their\nsupplementary papers and argument as indicated by the court itself\nin\nits judgment. I think that these reasons alone were sufficient to\npersuade the court below to entertain the review ground. This\ncourt\nis thus at large to interfere.\n[\n47] \tSection 47 of the\nZoning Scheme prescribes specific building lines for buildings and\nreads:\nâ\n(1) Except as provided in\nsubsection (2), no building which is a Dwelling House, Double\nDwelling House, Group of Dwelling Houses or\nan Outbuilding to any of\nthe foregoing shall be erected nearer than 4,5m to any street\nboundary of the site of such building provided\nthat:\nwhere a lesser building line is\n\tprescribed for the street concerned in Schedule 4 of Appendix A, the\n\tdistance prescribed in terms\nof Schedule 4 shall apply;\nthe above\n\tprohibition shall not apply to the boundary between a site and a\n\tstreet or portion thereof adjacent to such site which\nstreet or\n\tportion cannot in the opinion of the Council be constructed or is in\n\tthe form of a service lane, pedestrian way or steps,\nand such\n\tboundary shall, for the purpose of Chapter VII, be deemed to be a\n\tcommon boundary.\n(2) Where the\naverage depth of the site of any building referred to in subsection\n(1) measured at right angles to a street boundary\nof such site does\nnot exceed 20m, such building may be erected nearer than 4,5m but not\nnearer than 3m to the street boundary concerned.\n(3) Where the\nboundaries of a site are so irregular that doubt or uncertainty\nexists as to the correct value of the average depth\nof the site, the\nCouncil shall define such average depth in accordance with the intent\nof this section.â\n[48] \tThe plan reflects that the dwelling is set\nback 3,233 metres from the north eastern street boundary. It\ntherefore infringes\nthe provisions of s 47(1) unless covered by the\nexceptions created by subsections (2) and (3). The appellants contend\nthat the municipality\nwas obliged to refuse plan approval in the face\nof this patent contravention of the 4,5 metre setback restriction.\n[49]\tHarrison contended that the average depth of\nthe site is less than 20 metres with the result that the exception in\ns 47(2) applies.\n In addition\n, it was\nargued on her behalf that even if there was an illegality the\nappellants had unduly delayed raising their challenge which\nis in any\nevent improper as the original plan and the source of the\ncontravention is not impeached.\n[50]\tThe municipality went further and argued that\nthe boundaries of the site are so irregular that doubt or uncertainty\nexists as\nto the correct value of the average depth of the site,\nwhich entitles the municipality to then define such average depth, as\nprovided\nfor in s 47(3).  It is difficult to see how the boundaries\nof the site can be said to be irregular as contemplated by that\nsection\nwhen the boundaries are made up of a series of straight\nlines. But that apart there is no suggestion in the papers that the\nmunicipality\nwas pertinently aware at the time it approved the plan\nthat the building encroached over the building line, least of all\nthat it\napplied the provisions of that section when determining\nwhether to approve the plan. Its reliance upon that provision thus\nseems\nto me to be an afterthought.\n[\n51]\tThe manner in which\nthe âaverage depthâ of a site is to be calculated for purposes of\ns 47(2) is in dispute but, on the view\nthat I take of the matter, it\nis not necessary to resolve that dispute and I have assumed for\npresent purposes that the building\nindeed encroaches over the\nbuilding line on its north eastern boundary by 1,267 metres as\nalleged by the appellants. The question\nthat then arises is whether\nthe appellants are entitled to have the plan set aside on that\nground.\n[52] \tThe infringement that is now complained of\nappeared on the original plan that was approved in February 2005. \nYet the challenge\nwas raised for the first time by the appellants\nmore than three years later in the replying affidavits that were\nfiled in May 2008.\nThe appellants had by then dragged the respondents\nthrough a whole gamut of internal processes and litigation.\nSignificantly, the\nappellants have from inception been aided by a\nbattery of experts. The appellantsâ explanation for failing to\nraise this challenge\nuntil the last moment is that they became aware\nof the issue only in the course of preparing their replying\naffidavits when it was\ndrawn to their attention by their town\nplanning advisor who had previously relied on handwritten notes and\nvisual memory as he was\nprevented from copying the submitted plan. I\nthink it is quite clear from that explanation that the real concern\nof the appellants\nwas unrelated to the distance that the building was\nto be constructed from the street boundary.\n[53] \tIn terms of s 7(1) of PAJA:\nâ\nAny proceedings for judicial\nreview in terms of section 6(1) must be instituted without\nunreasonable delay and not later than 180\ndays after the date â\n. . .\non which any proceedings instituted in terms of internal remedies as\n\tcontemplated in subsection (2)\n(a)\nhave\n\tbeen concluded; or\nwhere no such remedies exist,\n\ton which the person concerned was informed of the administrative\n\taction, became aware of the action\nand the reasons for it or might\n\treasonably have been expected to have become aware of the action and\n\tthe reasons.â\n[54\n]\tThe appellants\nâmight reasonably have been expected to have become awareâ of the\ninfringement when they first inspected the\noriginal plan and\nproceedings for review on that ground ought ordinarily have been\ncommenced within 180 days of that date.  Section\n9(2) however allows\nthe extension of these time frames where âthe interests of justice\nso requireâ. And the question whether\nthe interests of justice\nrequire the grant of such extension depends on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case: the party seeking\nit must furnish a full\nand reasonable explanation for the delay which covers the entire\nduration thereof and relevant factors include\nthe nature of the\nrelief sought, the extent and cause of the delay, its effect on the\nadministration of justice and other litigants,\nthe importance of the\nissue to be raised in the intended proceedings and the prospects of\nsuccess.\n23\n[55] \tHere, it seems to me that had the appellants\nindeed been concerned about the distance that the building was to be\nconstructed\nfrom the street, there is simply no acceptable\nexplanation for why the infringement was not detected by their\nadvisers at the outset.\nIn my view, this lapse which as I have\nindicated shows that this infraction was not their primary concern,\ndoes not favour the appellantsâ\napplication on this ground.\n[56]\tBut there is further reason why the challenge\nshould not be entertained at this late stage.\nAs\npointed out by this court in\nOudekraal\nEstates (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town\n:\n24\nâ\n[A] court\nthat is asked to set aside an invalid administrative act in\nproceedings for judicial review has a discretion whether to\ngrant or\nto withhold the remedy.  It is that discretion that accords to\njudicial review its essential and pivotal role in administrative\nlaw,\nfor it constitutes the indispensable moderating tool for avoiding or\nminimising injustice when legality and certainty collide.â\n[57]\nEven before the\nadvent of PAJA it was recognised that there may be circumstances in\nwhich delay might justify the refusal of relief,\nthereby effectively\ngiving legal effect to an otherwise unlawful act. In\nHarnaker\nv Minister of the Interior\n,\n25\nwhich concerned a challenge to a\nlegislative act, the court said the following:\n26\nâ\n[I]f the\naffected members of the public, having\nlocus\nstandi\nto\napply to Court for an order declaring the legislative act null and\nvoid, delay unreasonably in taking such action and this causes\nprejudice, I do not see why they should not all be precluded from\nobtaining relief.  . . . I can see no inequity arising from the\napplication of the delay rule in this way. Accordingly . . .\nunreasonable delay by the plaintiff in instituting action, coupled\nwith\nresultant prejudice to defendant, is a valid defence, or\nobjection, to the action.â\n[\n58]\tIn\nWolgroeiers\nAfslaers v Munisipaliteit van Kaapstad\n27\nthis Court, after an extensive\ndiscussion of\nHarnaker\nand\nother cases, set out the parameters of a courtâs discretion in\nrelation to delay:\n28\nâ\nW\nhat\nhas indeed been prescribed by our Courts is that proceedings should\nbe instituted within a reasonable time and, as I have already\nmentioned, the Court is at liberty, depending on the circumstances\nand in the exercise of its discretion, to condone unreasonable\ndelay\nin appropriate cases. l cannot possibly accept that in the\nformulation of the requirement that proceedings should be instituted\nwithin a reasonable time, it was intended to fetter the Courtâs\ndiscretion to such an extent that even where a litigant disregards\nthe Courtâs directive by unnecessary and excessive delay in\nbringing proceedings, the Court does not have the right to refuse the\napplication merely because it is not proved or cannot be proved that\nthe respondent was not materially prejudiced, even though there\nwere,\non a review of all the circumstances, other well- founded reasons for\nthe exercise of its discretion against the applicant.\nI\naccept that prejudice to the respondent and the degree thereof are\nrelevant factors in the consideration of whether unreasonable\ndelay\nought to be overlooked, and that they can sometimes be the decisive\nfactor, especially in cases of comparatively trivial delays\n.\n. .\nWhilst,\nas I have already indicated, the question whether there was an\nunreasonable delay requires a factual finding, the answer to\nthe\nquestion whether an unreasonable delay ought to be overlooked rests\nin the discretion of the Court, exercised by taking into\nconsideration all the relevant circumstances and factors.â (my\nemphasis.)\n[\n59]\tIn\nOudekraal\n,\n29\nthis court, dealing with the necessity\nfor a review to be properly brought by a party seeking to set aside\nan alleged invalid administrative\nact, referred to the\nWolgroeiers\ndictum set out in the preceding paragraph and remarked as follows:\nâ\nNo doubt a\ncourt that might be called upon to exercise its discretion will take\naccount of the long period that has elapsed since\nthe approval was\ngranted, but the lapse of time in itself will not necessarily be\ndecisive: Much will depend upon a balancing of\nall the relevant\ncircumstances, including the need for finality, but also the\nconsequences for the public at large and indeed for\nfuture\ngenerations, of allowing the invalid decision to stand. In weighing\nthe question whether the lapse of time should preclude\na court from\nsetting aside the invalid administrative act in question an important\nâ perhaps even decisive â consideration is the extent to which\nthe appellant or third parties might have acted in reliance upon\nit.â\n[60]\t A review application to the Cape High Court\nfollowed on this courtâs decision in\nOudekraal\n,\nwhich once again resulted in an appeal to this court. In the second\nappeal â\nOudekraal Estates (Pty) Ltd v\nCity of Cape Town\n30\n(\nI shall refer to the second\nappeal as\nOudekraal 2)\nâ this court, in\napplying\nWolgroeiers\n,\n31\nhad regard to the following dictum from\nthat case:\n32\nâ\nIf it is alleged that an\napplicant did not institute the proceedings within a reasonable time,\nthe Court must decide (a) whether the\nproceedings were in fact only\nlaunched after a reasonable time had elapsed and (b) if so, whether\nthe unreasonable delay should be\ncondoned. Again, as it appears to\nme, with reference to (b), the Court exercises a judicial discretion\nwhile taking into consideration\nall the relevant circumstances.â\n[61]\tIn\nSetsokosane Busdiens (Edms) Bpk v Voorsitter, Nasionale\nVervoerkommissie\n,\n33\nwith reference to the aforesaid passage from\nWolgroeiers\n,\nthe following was stated:\nâ\nThe investigation, as far as\n(a)\nis concerned, has nothing to do with the Courtâs discretion; it is\nsimply an examination of the facts of the case in order to determine\nwhether the period which has elapsed, in the light of all the\nrelevant circumstances, was reasonable or unreasonable. (\nWolgroeiers\nAfslaers\nat 42C-D;\nSchoultz v Voorsitter,\nPersoneel-Advieskomitee van die Munisipale Raad van George, en ân\nander\n1983 (4) SA 689\n(C) at 697-8.) Naturally, the finding which is made in that regard\nimplies that the Court makes a value judgment in the sense of\nthe\nCourtâs view of the reasonableness of the period which has elapsed\nin the circumstances of the case. Equating such a value\njudgment with\na discretion is, however, legally and logically indefensible.â\n34\n[62]  \tIn the present case the lapse of three\nyears before the appellants acted was undoubtedly inordinate,\nparticularly if regard\nis had to the promptitude with which people\nmight ordinarily be expected to act and build in accordance with\napproved building plans.\n Proceeding to the next step of the enquiry,\nnamely whether the delay should nevertheless be condoned, it is\nnecessary to step back\nand consider the totality of circumstances.\nThere is no suggestion that Harrison consciously flouted the building\nline restriction.\n Acting in reliance upon the approval of the plan\nshe has built a substantial structure. Besides the substantial cost\nthat would\nbe necessitated by adapting the building, Harrison has\nsustained considerable cost in defending litigation that was quite\nunrelated\nto the encroachment over the building line. Moreover, the\ninfraction is relatively minimal, so much so that it went unnoticed\neven\nby the array of experts employed by the appellants until the\nlitigation was well advanced.\nThe local authority supports\nHarrison and there is not the slightest prospect that the infraction\nwill impact in any meaningful way\non the aesthetics or future\ndevelopment of Camps Bay. Throughout this saga Harrison has attempted\nto the best of her ability to deal\nwith the appellantsâ concerns.\nThey, on the other hand, have been intractable. For all these reasons\nI conclude that the delay\nin raising this issue should not be\ncondoned and the application to review and set aside the plans on\nthat ground should not succeed.\n[63]\tFor these reasons the appeal should fail. It is accordingly\ndismissed with costs including the costs of two counsel.\n______________________\nMML MAYA\nJudge of\nAppeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nAPPELLANTS:\tDF Irish SC with IC Bremridge\nInstructed by Abe Swersky & Associates, Cape\nTown\nLovius-Block, Bloemfontein\nFIRST RESPONDENT:\tHP Viljoen SC with JC Marais\nInstructed by Kritzinger & Co, Cape Town\nMatsepes Inc, Bloemfontein\nSECOND RESPONDENT:\t\tG Budlender SC with K Pillay\nInstructed by Abraham & Gross,\nCape Town\nEG Cooper & Majiedt Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\n[1984] ZASCA 51\n;\n1984 (3) SA 623\n(A) at 634-635C.\n2\nSection 62(1) of the Systems Act entitles â[a]\n\tperson whose rights are affected by a decision taken by a political\n\tstructure,\npolitical office bearer, councillor or staff member of a\n\tmunicipality in terms of a power or duty delegated or sub-delegated\n\tby\na delegating authority to the political structure, political\n\toffice bearer, councillor or staff member, [to] appeal against that\n\tdecision by giving written notice of the appeal and reasons to the\n\tmunicipal manager within 21 days of the date of the notification\nof\n\tthe decisionâ.\n3\nThe review proceedings which would have targeted\n\tthe September 2005 plan approval never got off the ground as the\n\tintended result\nwas achieved in the s 62 appeal proceedings.\n4\nThe Regulations were p\nromulgated\n\tin terms of s 9(2) of the Land Use Planning Ordinance 15 of 1985\n\tpublished in Provincial Gazette 4684 of 1 March 1991\n.\n5\nThe judgment is reported as\nPS\n\tBooksellers (Pty) Ltd v Harrison\n2008\n\t(3) SA 633\n(C) per Meer J.\n6\nSee\nPaola v Jeeva NO\n[2003] ZASCA 100\n;\n2004 (1) SA 396\n(SCA) paras 14-16;\nWalele v City of Cape Town\n[2008] ZACC 11\n;\n2008\n\t(6) SA 129\n(CC).\n7\nSee Part A16 of the Regulations under the\n\tBuilding Standards Act, GN R2378 RG4565, 12 October 1990 (the\n\tBuilding Regulations) which\nstipulates the tertiary educational\n\tqualifications which must be vetted by the Human Sciences Research\n\tCouncil that a building\ncontrol officer must possess to qualify for\n\tthe position.\n8\nSection 4(3) sets out the nature of the\n\tparticulars which the application envisaged in the section should\n\tcontain.\n9\nThe material part of this letter reads:\nâThe approval of these\n\tbuilding plans with their reliance on a fictitious and unattainable\n\tfinished level of the ground abutting\nthe faÃ§ade of the building\n\twould permit the retention of the currently illegal building when\n\tthe height of the faÃ§ade would exceed\nthe 10m limitation (by some\n\t2m) â¦ [t]hat is, the unlawfully constructed three storey building\n\tachieves, and would retain, a physical\nheight of one storey higher\n\tthan the legitimate expectations of the owners of adjoining and\n\tneighbouring properties.

    "facts": "The dispute centres on building plans for Erf 590 Brighton Estate Extension No. 2, Camps Bay. The municipality approved an initial three‑storey plan in January 2005 and, after objections from the neighbours (the appellants), approved a substantially revised plan in September 2005. The appellants obtained an interdict and succeeded in an s62 appeal that set aside the September 2005 plan. Later, a further plan (506011) was approved in September 2007 as a rider to the original plan. The appellants contend that the approved plan breaches restrictive title‑deed setback conditions, exceeds the 10‑metre height limit in the zoning scheme, and that the municipality failed to consider their objections and to provide a proper recommendation from the building control officer.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the municipality breached s 7(1)(a) and (b)(ii) of the Building Standards Act by not giving due regard to the appellants' objections. 2. Whether the building control officer’s memorandum satisfied the statutory requirement of a proper recommendation. 3. Whether the approval of the plan as a rider was ultra‑vio​lus under the Building Standards Act. 4. Whether the plan contravenes the restrictive title‑deed setback clause D(d). 5. Whether the plan violates the 10‑metre height restriction under s 98 of the Zoning Scheme. 6. Whether the plan breaches the 4.5‑metre setback requirement of s 47 of the Zoning Scheme. 7. Whether the delay in raising the s 47 ground defeats the review on the basis of unreasonable delay under PAJA.",
    "principles": "The court applied the Building Standards Act (sections 4‑7) requiring written municipal approval and consideration of objections, the duty of the building control officer to make a proper recommendation (s 6(1)(a)), and the procedural fairness requirements of PAJA. It reiterated the test from Plascon‑Evans for reviewing administrative decisions, the principle that a municipality may approve amended or rider plans under s 17(1) and Regulation A25, and the doctrine of legality that administrative acts must be within statutory authority. The court also considered case law on delay in judicial review (Oudekraal, Wolgroeiers, Harnaker) and the need for a court to exercise discretion in condoning late applications.",
    "application": "The court found that the municipality had considered the written objections, that the building control officer’s memorandum adequately summarised the objections and provided sufficient information for the decision‑maker, and that the approval as a rider fell within the implied power under the Building Standards Act and its regulations. It held that the plan complied with the title‑deed setback condition and did not exceed the 10‑metre height limit, as expert evidence confirmed. The s 47 ground was raised too late, and the three‑year delay was unreasonable with no satisfactory explanation, making that ground untenable. Consequently, the appeal failed on all raised issues.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel, confirming the municipality’s approval of the plan and leaving the interdict and related orders in place."
