Unfortunately\r\nhistory has proved it to be fertile ground for litigation, the law\r\nreports being replete\nwith decisions concerning the validity of deeds\r\nof sale of land. Consequently, it has been remarked that the section\r\nhas failed\nto achieve its objectives, and it has indeed correctly\r\nbeen observed that reading between the lines the section is often\r\nabused,\nin particular ‘by unscrupulous sellers who regret\r\nhaving sold the property at the price they did and then try to\r\nrescind\nthe contract because of non-compliance with the technical\r\nformality requirements of the Act’.\n1\nThis comment is not\r\nwithout substance, but it may be somewhat unfair. Human nature being\r\nwhat it is, there may well have been many\nmore disputes arising out\r\nof the sale of land had no formalities been required and, as Innes J\r\nobserved in\nWilken\r\nv Kohler\n1913\r\nAD 135\nat 142, whether such a provision ‘does not create as\r\ngreat hardships as it prevents, is a matter upon which opinions may\r\nwell differ’.\n[2] Be that as it may, this is another\r\ncase in which a seller of immovable property alleges that the sale is\r\nvoid for non-compliance\nwith the section. Like many of the reported\r\ndecisions dealing with the section, the case turns on whether the\r\ndescription of the\nproperty sold (the\nres vendita\n) and the\r\npurchase price, both of which are material terms of a sale, have been\r\nadequately set out. The court a quo, on exception,\ndetermined that\r\nthe written agreement upon which the respondent had sued the\r\nappellants for damages complied with the requirements\nof s 2(1) and\r\nthat the sale was valid and enforceable, but granted the appellants\r\nleave to appeal to this court. For convenience\nI shall refer to the\r\nappellants as ‘the first and second defendants’ and to\r\nthe respondent as ‘the plaintiff’.\n[3] At the heart of the dispute lies a\r\nletter dated 15 June 2005 addressed by plaintiff to the defendants\r\nwhich reads as follows;\n‘\nDear\r\nSirs\nSUITES\r\n207, 8 AND 9\n1.\r\nWe address you to clearly record our agreement.\n2.\r\n(First defendant) is purchasing from us the units described as\r\nSections 21, 22 and 23 Twindale measuring 260 square meters together\n\nwith eight parking bays numbered 4 (double bay) 5 (double bay) 6\r\n(double bay) and open parking bays 15 and 16 and an undivided\nshare\r\nin the common property for R2 178,000.\n3.\r\n(First defendant) is intending to replace Twindale with a new\r\nbuilding comprising offices and apartments. We confirm that you\nwill\r\nirrevocably provide us with an office unit (at the same price for\r\nwhich sections 21, 22 and 23 were sold to you) of the same\nsize and\r\nwith a similar number of parking bays (8). In addition to this (first\r\ndefendant) also grants an option to (the plaintiff)\nto purchase up to\r\na further 140 square meters at the market price prevailing when the\r\nnew building is completed.\n4.\r\nWe have been advised by (second defendant) that the replacement\r\nbuilding will be erected within two years of getting the necessary\n\nrezoning rights. Accordingly, if the replacement building is not\r\nerected within thirty months of getting the necessary rezoning\nrights\r\nthen (second defendant) personally is liable to provide us with a\r\nsimilar office of identical size in a similar building\nin a similar\r\narea for the same purchase price.\n5.\r\nKindly confirm that the aforegoing correctly records our agreement by\r\nsigning where indicated below and returning the signed\ndocument to\r\nus.\n6.\r\nIt is recorded that (first defendant) is entitled to nominate a third\r\nparty to be the purchaser of the space to be acquired.’\n[4] Acting in both his personal\r\ncapacity and as representative of the first defendant, a company with\r\nlimited liability, the second\ndefendant indicated his acceptance of\r\nthese terms by signing at the foot of the document. As is readily\r\napparent, the document\nembraced a number of agreements, namely:\nThe plaintiff’s sale to the\r\n\tfirst defendant of sections 21, 22 and 23 of Twindale, together with\r\n\teight parking bays and\nan undivided share in the common property, at\r\n\ta purchase price of R2,178m – as set out in clause 2.\nThe first defendant’s sale to\r\n\tthe plaintiff of an office unit of 260 m\n2\ntogether with\r\n\teight parking bays, in the building it intended to build at Twindale\r\n\tat the same purchase price of R2,178m –\nas set out in clause\r\n\t3.\nAn option extended by the first\r\n\tdefendant to the plaintiff to sell it a further 140 m\n2\nin\r\n\tthe new building ‘at the market price prevailing when the new\r\n\tbuilding is completed’ – as also set out in\nclause 3.\nIn the event of the necessary\r\n\trezoning for the proposed development not being forthcoming, the\r\n\tsecond defendant’s sale to\nthe plaintiff of a similar office\r\n\tof identical size at the same price – as set out in clause 4.\n[5] It is common cause that pursuant\r\nto clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff sold and transferred\r\nsections 21, 22 and 23\nat Twindale, the eight parking bays and\r\nthe undivided share of the community property to the first defendant.\r\nIt is also common\ncause that the necessary rezoning for the\r\ndevelopment was effected during November 2006. However, the\r\ntransactions envisaged in\nclause 3 of the agreement appear not to\r\nhave come about and, in September 2008, the plaintiff instituted\r\naction against the defendants,\nalleging that the sale in clause 3\r\n(viz the sale of office unit of 260 m\n2\nin the new building\r\nand eight parking bays) had been cancelled as a result of their\r\nrepudiation of the agreement, causing it to\nsuffer damages in the sum\r\nof R5,62m being the difference between the value of the property\r\npurchased and the price of R2,178m it\nwould have been obliged to pay\r\nfor it.\n[6] On pleading to this claim, the\r\ndefendants denied being liable for the alleged damages. While they\r\nadmitted that the sale in\nclause 2 had been effected and that the\r\nrezoning envisaged in clause 4 had taken place, they denied having\r\nrepudiated the agreement\nor that the plaintiff had suffered damage.\r\nIn addition, they specifically pleaded that the agreement was:\n‘\n3.3.1\r\nvoid for vagueness of the description of the properties mentioned in\r\nclauses 3 and/or 4 . . . and/or\n3.3.2\r\nvoid for vagueness for stipulating the purchase price of the option\r\nin clause 3 . . . to be the market price; and/or\n3.3.3\r\nof no force or effect due to non-compliance with the formalities of\r\nwriting and signature prescribed by\nsection 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of\nLand Act 68 of 1981\non account of the vagueness of the description of\r\nthe properties mentioned in clauses 3 and/or 4 . . . ; and/or\n3.3.4\r\nof no force or effect due to non-compliance with the formalities of\r\nwriting and signature prescribed by\nsection 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of\nLand Act 68 of 1981\non account of stipulating the purchase price of\r\nthe option in clause 3 . . . to be the market price.’\n[7] To this the plaintiff filed an\r\nexception, contending that the defence in paragraph 3.3 of the\r\nplea viz that the contract\nwas of no force or effect, was\r\nunsustainable. In this way the matter came before the court a quo,\r\nwhich was called to decide the\nsimple issue whether the terms of the\r\nsale sued upon complied with the requirements of\ns 2(1).\n[8] The judgment of the court a quo is\r\nas confused as it is confusing. The judge who heard the matter\r\nappears to have regarded the\nplea as an exception to the claim and\r\nthe plaintiff’s exception to the plea to thus be an exception\r\nto an exception. Then,\nafter having concluded that he was not\r\nconfident that the plaintiff’s exception should succeed, he\r\nstated that he had to\nfind ‘a practical way of dealing with\r\nthis matter in a way which should work for both parties’ and\r\nproceeded to uphold\nthe exception. However, in paragraphs 2 and 3 of\r\nhis order, he went on to grant the successful plaintiff, against\r\nwhose claim exception\nhad not been taken, leave to amend its\r\nparticulars of claim; and the defendants, whose plea he had found to\r\nbe excipiable, leave\nto plead to the claim if the plaintiff did so\r\namend or, if it did not, to either file such other pleading as they\r\nshould deem fit\nor to amend their plea. It is this order which is the\r\nsubject of this appeal.\n[9] Although in their plea the\r\ndefendants relied upon the alleged invalidity of all the agreements\r\nreferred to in clauses 3 and\n4 of the letter of 15 June 2005 as a\r\ndefence to the enforceability of the sale contained in clause 3, I\r\ndid not understand them\nto persist in their contention that the\r\nalleged invalidity of the second defendant’s conditional sale\r\nto the plaintiff of\na similar office contained in clause 4 visited\r\ninvalidity upon the sale in clause 3. The defendant’s argument,\r\nhowever, was\nthat both the sale and the option set out in clause 3\r\nwere part of a single unitary contract so that, if the property or\r\nthe price\nin either the sale or the option were not adequately\r\ndescribed, the entire agreement failed and neither the sale nor the\r\noption\nwould be enforceable. As against that, the plaintiff argued\r\nthat the option was separate and divisible from the sale and that,\r\neven if the option was invalid (which it denied) the sale would not\r\nbe affected and would remain effective. It is to this issue\nthat I\r\nfirst turn.\n[10] At the outset it must be\r\nremembered that there is a distinction between the severance of a\r\nportion of a contract, eg on grounds\nof vagueness or illegality, and\r\nrecognising that a contract may contain several distinct and separate\r\nagreements divisible from\neach other. As was explained in Wessels\nThe\nLaw of Contract in South Africa\n2 ed vol 1 para 1615:\n‘\nIt\r\nis often loosely said that a contract is divisible or separable\r\nwhere, though in form there is only one contract, in reality\nthere\r\nare several distinct agreements entered into at the same time. There\r\nis, however, a clear distinction between this class\nof contract and a\r\ndivisible or separable contract.\nIf\r\nthe obligation is divisible in the material or physical sense, there\r\nis only one contract, though the subject matter may consist\nof\r\nseveral parts considered as one whole. The contract is entire, but\r\nthe object of the obligation is separable into homogeneous\nparts. If,\r\nhowever, there are several distinct obligations, we are not dealing\r\nwith a divisible or separable contract at all, but\nwith a collection\r\nof separate contracts embodied in one single writing or agreement.\nThus,\r\nthe sale of a quantity of coal to be delivered by instalments of so\r\nmany tons is, as a rule, an entire contract in which the\nobligation\r\nis divisible. In such a case it may be the intention of the parties\r\nthat a default on the part of the seller in delivering,\nor on the\r\npart of the purchaser in accepting, one instalment will not justify a\r\ncancellation of the contract (\nSimpson\r\nv Crippin\n, 1872, 8\r\nLRQB 14:\n42 LJQB 28:\n27 LT 546).\nOn the other hand, the sale of\r\nStichus and Pamphilus for 100 and 200 aurei respectively is in\r\nreality an independent sale of Stichus\nfor 100 and of Pamphilus for\r\n200 aurei (D. 45.1.29.pr.).’\n[11]\r\nWhere there is a sale ‘of several distinct and separate items\r\nand a price is fixed to each, the contract as a rule, will\nbe held to\r\nbe composed of several agreements’.\n2\nFurthermore,\r\nthe nature of the performance required under a contract can be of\r\ndecisive importance, and a contract is usually divisible\nwhere it\r\nmakes provision for separate or distinctive performances.\n3\nThus\r\nin\nMiddleton\r\nv Carr\n1949\r\n(2) SA 374\n(A) at 391 Schreiner JA, in concluding that an undertaking\r\nby a husband to pay his estranged wife a substantial sum of money was\n\nseverable from a collusive agreement for divorce, said:\n‘\nBut\r\nthe fact that the two agreements were made at the same time does not\r\nprovide sufficient reason for treating them as in fact\none agreement;\r\nto reach that conclusion it would be necessary to find some express\r\nor implied interlocking of their terms.’\n[12] In\nNash\r\nv Golden Dumps (Pty) Ltd\n1985\r\n(3) SA 1\n(A) the parties had concluded a written contract of\r\nemployment which also included an option that entitled the appellant\r\nto purchase\nshares in a company still to be founded when its shares\r\nbecame available. This court concluded that the share option\r\nconstituted\nthe consideration or reward extended to the appellant for\r\ncarrying out a specific mandate which it was contemplated he would\r\ncomplete\nprior to commencing employment with the respondent, and was\r\nquite distinct from his duties under the employment contract. It\r\ntherefore\nheld that although the share option and the employment\r\ncontract were both ‘contained in the same agreement and were\r\nlinked\nin a practical sense, juristically they were separate\r\nagreements, with independent sets of reciprocal rights and\r\nobligations.’\n4\n[13] In the present case, the sale of\r\nthe office unit, which gave rise to a set of reciprocal rights and\r\nduties, was wholly independent\nand separate from the option extended\r\nto the plaintiff to purchase a further and additional portion of the\r\nbuilding, which gave\nrise to a different set of rights and\r\nobligations. The two agreements related to two different and separate\r\nunits of property in\nrespect of which different prices were fixed.\r\nThe terms of the two agreements were in no way entwined or\r\ninterlocked, either expressly\nor by necessary implication. On\r\npurchasing the office unit, the plaintiff was under no obligation to\r\nexercise its rights under\nthe option to purchase the additional 140\r\nm\n2\n. It had the discretion to do so if it so wished. Thus\r\nalthough both the sale of the office unit and the option to buy a\r\nfurther\nportion of the building were contained in the same document,\r\nthe rights and obligations arising from each were completely separate\n\nfrom each other.\n[14] In these circumstances, I have no\r\nhesitation in concluding that the sale and the option in clause 3 of\r\nthe agreement are separate,\ndivisible and independent contracts. That\r\nbeing so, it is unnecessary to consider whether the option was\r\ninvalid in order to determine\nthe validity of the sale of the office\r\nunit or to determine that the purchase price referred to in the\r\noption viz ‘the market\nprice prevailing’ visited nullity\r\nupon the option, as the defendants contend. The sole issue then is\r\nwhether the sale in\nclause 3 should be regarded as invalid due to the\r\nalleged vagueness of the description of the\nres vendita\n.\n[15] It is now well settled that, in\r\nregard to the description of the property, the test for determining\r\nwhether\ns 2(1)\nhas been complied with is whether the land\r\nalienated can be identified from the contract itself without\r\nresorting to evidence from\nthe parties regarding their negotiations\r\nand their consensus. In arguing that the description of the property\r\ncontained in clause\n3 is too vague to be enforceable, counsel for the\r\ndefendants emphasised that there was no plan of the proposed\r\ndevelopment and\nthat the selection of the unit had been vested in the\r\nsole discretion of the first defendant which, apart from being\r\nobliged to\nensure its floor size was 260 m\n2\n, had the sole\r\ndiscretion to determine its shape, its position on any floor and its\r\nsituation in the building. As the subject of\nthe sale was only a\r\nportion of the new building, so defendants’ counsel argued, it\r\nwas therefore necessary to set out the\nprecise dimensions of the\r\noffice unit, its shape, the height of its walls, its precise\r\nsituation in the building (viz on what floor\nit was to be and in what\r\ndirection it would face) as well as details in regard to the style of\r\narchitecture to be used in the construction\nof the building (eg\r\nmodern or Victorian) or else the unit could not be identified from\r\nthe terms of the contract itself. He conceded\nthat the effect of his\r\nargument was that all the information that would be derived from an\r\naccurate three dimensional plan would\nhave to be set out in order to\r\nsatisfy the requirements of\ns 2(1).\n[16] This argument\r\nflies in the face of the now well established principle that the\r\nsection does not require ‘a faultless\ndescription of the\r\nproperty sold couched in meticulously accurate terms’.\n5\nIn cases such as\r\nthis there are two broad categories of contract: first, those where\r\nthe document itself sufficiently describes\nthe property to enable\r\nidentification on the ground; second, those where it appears from the\r\ncontract that the parties intended\nthat either the buyer or the\r\nseller should choose the\nres\r\nvendita\nfrom\r\na genus or class. In\nClements\r\nv Simpson\n1971\r\n(3) SA 1\n(A) at 7-8, Holmes JA stated the following in regard to the\r\nlatter category:\n‘\nFor\r\nexample, if a dog breeder says to a prospective purchaser, \"I\r\noffer you the pick of this litter for R100\", and the\nbuyer\r\naccepts, no further\nconsensus\nis\r\nrequired. There is a valid sale; and the buyer may choose his pup.\r\nOr, in regard to land, a prospective buyer might offer in\nwriting to\r\nbuy, and a specified price, one out of several sites in a township,\r\nthe buyer to select the particular site. The seller\naccepts in\r\nwriting. That is a valid sale as far as the\nres\r\nvendita\nis\r\nconcerned, for the\nres\nis\r\nascertainable or identifiable on the unilateral selection of the\r\nbuyer.’\n[17] The facts in\nClements\r\nv Simpson\nprovide\r\na useful illustration of a case in which the contract is not to be\r\nregarded as being void due to the selection of the property\nhaving\r\nbeen entrusted to one of the parties. The deed of sale related to a\r\nsection of a property which the seller was to sub-divide\nfrom the\r\nproperty as a whole. The area of this sub-divided property was agreed\r\nat 4 000 square feet and the general location\nwas fixed, but the\r\nshape was to be determined by the seller and, until he did so, the\r\nland sold could not be identified on the\nground. This did not prevent\r\nthis court from concluding that there had been a valid sale. In doing\r\nso, Holmes JA said:\n6\n‘\n(H)ere\r\nthe intention of the parties, as gathered from the language of their\r\ncontract, was not to enable identification of the land\nsold by\r\nreference to description; it was to be identifiable only after the\r\nseller had decided upon the lay-out and shape and sub-division\nof a\r\nsite conforming to certain specified requirements. It is in my view a\r\nclear example of the second category mentioned earlier.\nThe\nconsensus\nof\r\nthe parties was complete. All that was needed for performance was the\r\nintended unilateral act of the seller in the matter of\nshape and\r\nsub-division. The fact that survey was required for that purpose\r\ncannot affect the question . . . .’\n[18] This decision has been regularly\r\nfollowed in this court, most recently in\nJR 209 Investments (Pty)\r\nLtd v Pine Villa Country Estate (Pty) Ltd\n2009 (4) SA 302\n(SCA),\r\na decision which is particularly instructive. The contract envisaged\r\nthe purchaser establishing a township on a piece of\nland that it\r\nintended to purchase from a private company whose sole director, Mr\r\nOberem, lived in a homestead on the property.\nIt was agreed that\r\nOberem would continue to live in the homestead on an erf which, after\r\nsub-division, would be between 5 000 m\n2\nand 5 653 m\n2\nin extent and which would be transferred into Oberem’s name as\r\nsoon as sub-division had been effected. By necessary implication,\nthe\r\npurchaser had the right to determine the precise shape and the size\r\nof the erf, subject of course to it being within the range\nof size\r\nagreed upon and upon such determination being bona fide. The argument\r\nthat the description of the\nres vendita\nwas inadequate was\r\nrejected.\n[19] These principles, and the\r\nillustrative effect thereof provided by the decisions in\nClements\r\nv Simpson\nand the\nJR 209 Investments\ncase in particular,\r\neffectively dispose of the appellants’ contention in the\r\npresent case. The size of the unit had been determined\n– it had\r\nto be 260 m\n2\n. Apart from the fact that it had to be\r\npositioned within the new building that the defendants were\r\nconstructing a Twindale, the\nparties were agreed that the precise\r\nshape and position in the building was something to be left to the\r\nbona fide discretion of\nthe first defendant. The consensus of the\r\nparties was complete and all that was needed was for the seller to\r\ndetermine the shape\nand precise situation within the new building of\r\nthe unit of the agreed size. This clearly fell within the second\r\nclass of category\nmentioned in\nClements v Simpson\nand\r\nconstituted an adequate description of the property sold. The\r\nexception to the defence that the sale was unenforceable for\nlack of\r\ncompliance with\ns 2(1)\nwas correctly taken and the appeal must fail.\n[20] It was argued by the defendants\r\nthat the case was not ripe for exception as evidence of surrounding\r\ncircumstances might throw\na different light on the validity of the\r\nsale. This misses the point. This is not a case in which external\r\nevidence might cure\na possible deficiency. The exception raises a\r\nsubstantive question of law, and the contract is to be construed\r\nwithout reference\nto the parties’ negotiations and consensus.\r\nDoing so, the sale in question clearly complies with\ns 2(1)\nand is\r\nvalid and enforceable. This goes to the very root of the defendants’\r\nplea that the sale is unenforceable, a plea which\nis therefore bad in\r\nlaw.\n[21] Due to the manner in which the\r\nplea was formulated, the appropriate order would be to strike out\r\nthose allegations in the plea\nin which the defendants allege that the\r\nsale is unenforceable. As doing so will remove a separate and\r\nself-contained defence which\nis legally unsound, no purpose would be\r\nserved by allowing the defendants leave to amend.\n[22] Unfortunately, there are a few\r\nfurther issues which must be mentioned. The first is the grant of\r\nleave to appeal to this court.\nAs is apparent from what I have said,\r\nthis matter fell to be determined by the application of well-known\r\nlegal principles to a\nsimple set of facts. It is a matter of no\r\ncomplexity, and it was wholly inappropriate for the court a quo to\r\nhave directed the\nappeal to be heard by this court whose time ought\r\nrather to be taken up dealing with matters of greater complexity and\r\ndifficulty\ntruly deserving of its attention – see eg\nShoprite\r\nCheckers (Pty) Ltd v Bumpers Schwarmas CC & others\n2003 (5)\r\nSA 354\n(SCA) para 23 and\nS v Monyane & others\n2008 (1)\r\nSACR 543\n(SCA) para 28.\n[23] Secondly, it is necessary to\r\ncomment on the undue delays that have afflicted the progress of this\r\nmatter. Despite the simplicity\nof the issues raised, it took more\r\nthan nine months after the exception had been argued on 19 February\r\n2009 before judgment was\ndelivered on 25 September 2009. As appears\r\nfrom correspondence handed in and incorporated into the record by\r\nconsent, this delay\noccurred despite the plaintiff’s attorney\r\nhaving addressed enquiries as to when the judgment was likely to be\r\ndelivered,\nfirst to the Judge President of the division after three\r\nmonths had elapsed and, subsequently, to the Deputy Judge President\r\nafter\nthe passing of another three months. Then, after the\r\napplication for leave to appeal had been argued on 16 October 2009,\r\nit took\nmore than three months until judgment was delivered on 2\r\nFebruary 2010. In this latter judgment the acting judge explained\r\nthat\nhe had been delayed by waiting for copies of certain judgments\r\nto be forwarded to him by counsel for the plaintiff, but that is\nnot\r\nan acceptable explanation as the judgments concerned had all been\r\nreported.\n[24] Justice delayed is justice\r\ndenied. The object of an exception is to deal with a case in an\r\nexpeditious manner, and a delay\nof some nine months in producing a\r\njudgment on such a simple matter of no complexity is at first blush\r\nwholly unacceptable –\nas is the delay of three months in\r\nproducing a judgment on a simple application for leave to appeal –\r\nall of which led to\nit taking a full calendar year from when the\r\nexception was argued until leave to appeal was granted: and this in a\r\nmatter in which\nboth judgments could have been delivered almost\r\nimmediately.\n[25] The Chief\r\nJustice is reported to have recently deprecated the number of\r\nreserved judgments as well as the delays taken by Judges\nto deliver\r\ntheir judgments, which he found to be ‘utterly unacceptable’,\r\nand to have remarked as long as such delays\nexisted judges could not\r\navoid the accusation that the justice system had failed to deliver on\r\nits promise of access to justice.\n7\nThese observations\r\nare justified. Judges are employed to give judgments. They owe it not\r\nonly to the litigants who appear before\nthem but to the public at\r\nlarge to do so expeditiously, and the administration of justice will\r\nfall into disrepute if they fail\nin that regard. The delays that\r\noccurred in this case are cause for concern.\n[26] Turning to the form of the order,\r\nthe appeal against the exception being upheld must be dismissed.\r\nHowever, as I have indicated,\nthe contents of paragraphs 2 and 3 of\r\nthe order of the court a quo are illogical and they must be set\r\naside. In addition, having\nsucceeded in its exception, the plaintiff\r\nought to have been awarded the costs and there was no reason for the\r\ncourt a quo to have\nreserved those costs as it did.\n[27] In the result the following order\r\nis made:\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nThe order of the court a quo is\r\n\taltered to read as follows:\n‘\n(a) The\r\nexception is upheld, with costs.\n(b) The words “and 3.3 to 3.3.4\r\nbelow” in para 3.2 of the plea are struck out.\n(c) Paragraph 3.3 of the plea is\r\nstruck out.’\n____________\nL E LEACH\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nR PILLAY AJA\n[28] I have read the judgment of Leach\r\nJA. I agree with my learned colleague’s conclusion and in\r\ngeneral with his reasoning.\nI can hardly quarrel with the proposition\r\nthat justice delayed is justice denied. Whilst stopping short of\r\ncriticising the trial\njudge for such delays as may have been\r\noccasioned in the matter, he nonetheless expresses some disquiet\r\nabout those delays. As\nregrettable as these delays might be, it is\r\napparent from his judgment, that we clearly do not know what the true\r\ncauses of the\ndelay in this instance were – hence his comment\r\nthat the delay is ‘at first blush unacceptable’ (para\r\n24). The\ndelay is either acceptable or it is not. Whether it is,\r\ndepends on all of the facts, which, as Leach JA appears to accept, we\r\nsimply\ndo not have. Consequently it would be wrong for us to\r\nspeculate as to such causes and apportion blame to the trial judge,\r\nabsent\na proper factual foundation to do so. Sitting as a court of\r\nappeal and being bound by the record, we should be slow to have\r\nregard\nto what may be contained in documents or reports that do not\r\nconstitute part of that record. Whilst what the Chief Justice may\r\nhave stated – if accurately reported – is to be lauded,\r\nit is unclear\nto me on what\r\nbasis we can have regard to what he reportedly may have said in\r\nholding the trial judge responsible for the delays.\nI would thus\r\nprefer not to associate myself with the observations expressed in\r\nparagraphs 23, 24 and 25 of Leach JA’s judgment.\n___________________\nR. PILLAY\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nEBRAHIM AJA\n[29] I have read the judgment of my\r\ncolleague Leach JA and concur in the conclusion he has reached on the\r\nmerits of the appeal and\nthe process of reasoning by which he arrives\r\nat that conclusion. I would accordingly agree with the order\r\nproposed.\n[30] On the matter extraneous to the\r\nmerits, that of ‘undue delays that have afflicted the progress\r\nof this matter, despite\nthe simplicity of the issues raised’,\r\nwhilst I agree, in general, that a delay in handing down a judgment\r\nexpeditiously is\nlikely to create in the minds of litigants and the\r\npublic at large, the perception of a dereliction of duty and\r\nresponsibility\non the part of the judge concerned, whoever he or she\r\nhappens to be, I am firmly of the view that, in the present matter,\r\nsuch\ncriticism is unwarranted. The simple state of affairs in this\r\ncase is that we do not have before us an explanation for the delay\n\nfrom the judge concerned so that, in the absence thereof, a critical\r\nexpose in the judgment of a failure to act timeously leads\n\nunnecessarily and unfairly to the creation of the public mindset\r\nalready referred to concerning the judge seized with this matter\nin\r\nthe court a quo. I think such criticism is undue and should not be\r\nencouraged. To that end, I dissociate myself from the critical\n\ncomments in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 of the judgment.\n________________\nS EBRAHIM\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANTS: H H Steyn\nInstructed by Jordaan & Wolberg\r\nAttorneys, Johannesburg\nE G Cooper Majiedt Inc, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT: J Peter SC\nInstructed by Shapiro Aarons Inc,\r\nJohannesburg\nHoney Attorneys, Bloemfontein\n1\nSee\r\n\tLotz and Nagel’s comment on\nJR 209 Investments (Pty) Ltd &\r\n\tanother v Pine Villa Country Estate (Pty) Ltd\n2009 (4) SA 302\n(SCA) : 2010 (43)\nDe Jure\n169 at 174.\n2\nWessels\r\n\top cit para 1618.\n3\nSee\r\n\teg\nBob’s Shoe Centre\r\n\tv Heneways Freight Services (Pty) Ltd\n[1994] ZASCA 158\n;\n1995\r\n\t(2) SA 421\n(A) at 429F-I and\nDu\r\n\tPlooy v Sasol Bedryf (Edms) Bpk\n1988\r\n\t(1) SA 438\n(A).\n4\nPer\r\n\tCorbett JA at 23D-E.\n5\nPer\r\n\tWatermeyer CJ in\nVan Wyk v\r\n\tRottcher’s Saw Mills (Pty) Ltd\n1948\r\n\t(1) SA 983\n(A) at 989, regularly cited with approval in this court:\r\n\tsee eg\nJR 209 Investments\r\n\t(Pty) Ltd v Pine Villa Country Estate (Pty) Ltd\n2009\r\n\t(4) SA 302\n(SCA) para 19.\n6\nAt\r\n\t9A-B.\n7\nwww.news24.com/South\nAfrica/News/Ngobo-SA-courts-need-reform-20101113.",

  "sections": {
    "facts": "In June 2005 the parties entered into a written agreement whereby Exdev (the plaintiff) sold to the first defendant three sections of Twindale (sections 21, 22 and 23) together with eight parking bays for R2,178,000. The agreement also provided that the first defendant would, once a new building was erected on the site, supply the plaintiff with an office unit of 260 m² and eight parking bays at the same price, and that the plaintiff would have an option to purchase a further 140 m² at market price. The necessary rezoning was obtained in November 2006, but the new building and the office unit were never delivered. The plaintiff sued for damages, alleging the sale of the office unit was void for vagueness and for non‑compliance with the Alienation of Land Act, s 2(1). The defendants argued the sale and the option formed a single contract and were invalid due to vague description and price terms.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the sale of the office unit (clause 3) complies with s 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act, i.e., whether the property can be identified from the contract without external evidence. 2. Whether the sale and the option constitute separate, divisible contracts or a single indivisible contract, and the effect of any alleged vagueness on each. 3. Whether the alleged lack of a precise description of size, shape and location renders the sale void.",
    "principles": "The court applied the established test for s 2(1): the land must be identifiable from the contract itself. Two categories of description are recognized: (a) a precise description that enables identification on the ground, and (b) a description that entrusts the selection to one party, provided the parties intended such unilateral selection. Leading authorities include Clements v Simpson (description can be left to the seller’s discretion) and JR 209 Investments v Pine Villa (size range and seller’s discretion are sufficient). The court also distinguished between divisible contracts (separate obligations) and a single contract with divisible performance, affirming that the sale of the office unit and the option were separate agreements.",
    "application": "The court held that the office‑unit sale and the option were distinct contracts; the option’s validity was irrelevant to the sale’s validity. The description in clause 3 specified a 260 m² office unit and eight parking bays, with the precise shape and floor location left to the first defendant’s bona‑fide discretion. Following Clements v Simpson, this satisfied the second category of description under s 2(1). Consequently, the sale was not void for vagueness, and the defendants’ argument that the entire agreement was invalid failed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The court altered the order of the court a quo, upholding the exception and striking out the specified paragraphs of the plea. The sale of the office unit was held valid and enforceable under the Alienation of Land Act."
