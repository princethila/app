The dispute\narose when the appellant, Mr Khoosial\r\nSingh, decided to buy a new BMW X5 4.41 automatic motor vehicle,\r\nwhich he had seen on\ndisplay at the premises of the second\r\nrespondent, a dealership trading as SMG Auto Durban (Pty) Ltd (‘SMG’)\r\nin December\n2005. He agreed with a sales-representative at SMG that\r\nthe vehicle would be ‘first registered’ in 2006, and was\r\nled\nto believe that the process of registering the vehicle would\r\nhappen in January 2006. When the vehicle was delivered to Mr Singh,\n\nit transpired that it had previously been registered – more\r\nthan once – in 2005. Thus began the quarrel between the\n\nparties.\n[2] The purchase price of the vehicle\r\nwas agreed to be R609 850. Mr Singh paid a deposit of R236 653.81,\r\nleaving a balance of some\nR373 000. To finance the balance Mr Singh\r\nentered into an instalment sale agreement with the first respondent,\r\nBMW Financial Services\n(Pty) Ltd (‘BMW’), which has its\r\nplace of business in Midrand, Gauteng. The document embodying the\r\nagreement was completed\nby the sales representative at SMG and Mr\r\nSingh signed it on 22 December 2005. The agreement specified, as\r\nagreements of this\nnature invariably do, that the finance house would\r\nretain ownership of the vehicle until Mr Singh had met his\r\nobligations, which\nincluded settling the principal debt and finance\r\ncharges.\n[3] The cover page of the three-page\r\nagreement included a description of the make of the vehicle, details\r\nof the purchase price,\nits chassis and engine numbers, registration\r\n(licence) number, and a reference to the ‘year of first\r\nregistration 2006’\nie the requirement that it be ‘first\r\nregistered’ in 2006.\n[4] Clause 2.2 of the agreement\r\nprovided that SMG, which acted as the agent for BMW Finance ‘for\r\nthe purposes of delivery’,\nwould deliver the vehicle to\r\nMr Singh within 30 days of the agreement being signed. On 31\r\nDecember 2005, nine days after the\nagreement was signed, the vehicle\r\nwas delivered with temporary licence plates to permit its usage for\r\n21 days pending its registration.\n[5] Early in January 2006, SMG\r\nrealized that the vehicle had previously been registered in 2005. It\r\nnotified Mr Singh of this fact\nand undertook to rectify the\r\n‘licensing error’ with the licensing office by reversing\r\nthe prior registration. By 21 February\n2006, despite Mr Singh\r\nhaving had several discussions with SMG concerning the problem, it\r\nremained unsolved. Mr Singh decided to\ninvestigate the matter himself\r\nand contacted the Pinetown Registering Authority to this end. He\r\ndiscovered that the vehicle had\nbeen registered on three previous\r\noccasions in 2005, on one occasion in SMG’s name.\n[6] Mr Singh then consulted his\r\nattorney who, on 2 March 2006, wrote to SMG demanding delivery of a\r\nvehicle, which accorded with\nthe description of the vehicle he had\r\npurchased – in particular one that was registered for the first\r\ntime in 2006. On 17\nMarch 2006, after SMG had not responded to the\r\nletter, Mr Singh’s attorney wrote another letter informing\r\nSMG that his\nclient would not renew the temporary permit, which had\r\nalready been renewed several times and was to expire on 20 March\r\n2006. The\nletter went on to tender return of the vehicle that had\r\nbeen delivered to Mr Singh and demanded that it be replaced. Again,\r\nSMG\ndid not respond. Two further letters to SMG on 1 and 3 April 2006\r\nalso failed to elicit a response.\n[7] On 5 April 2006 Mr Singh queried\r\nthe registration status of the vehicle with the Motor Licensing\r\nBureau of Windsor Park, Durban.\nHe established that he had been\r\nregistered as the owner as of 4 April 2006 and that the vehicle’s\r\ncurrent licence number\nand two previous licence numbers bore no\r\nresemblance to the licence number that appeared on the agreement.\r\nImportantly, a confirmation\ncertificate issued by the Bureau\r\nreflected the ‘date of liability for first licensing’ as\r\n21 October 2005 and\nthe vehicle’s status as ‘used’\r\neven though he had purchased it as ‘new’.\n[8] On 21 April 2006 SMG informed Mr\r\nSingh that ‘the correct licensing had now been received from\r\nthe licensing department’.\nThis was a reference to a new\r\nCertificate of Registration that SMG had obtained from another\r\nlicencing body, the Umhlanga Rocks\nRegistering Authority. The\r\ncertificate reflected Mr Singh as the owner, the ‘date of\r\nliability for first licensing (not\nyear model)’ and the ‘date\r\nliable for registration’ as 4 April 2006, and the status of the\r\nvehicle as ‘new’,\nwhich contradicted the documentation\r\nthat Mr Singh had acquired indicating that the vehicle was used. The\r\nname of the title holder\nwas given as ‘BMW Finanz (Pty) Ltd\r\nUmhlanga Rock’ (sic) and the vehicle’s previous three\r\nlicence numbers, which\nI referred to in the previous paragraph, were\r\nalso displayed on the certificate.\n[9] In summary Mr Singh was unhappy\r\nthat:\n(a) the vehicle was ‘first\r\nregistered’ in 2005 in the name of SMG and other persons\r\nunknown to him before being registered\nin his name in 2006;\n(b) his investigations had revealed\r\nthat the vehicle’s status was ‘used’ whereas the\r\ncertificate that SMG had\nobtained from the Umhlanga Rocks Registering\r\nAuthority stated that the vehicle was ‘new’; and that\n(c) the registration (licence) number\r\non the agreement differed from any of the vehicle’s previous\r\nlicence numbers.\n[10] He now believed that the vehicle\r\nthat had been delivered to him was not the one he had contracted for.\r\nSo he instituted proceedings\nin the Durban High Court against BMW and\r\nSMG on 11 May 2006 in which he sought an order for specific\r\nperformance, namely delivery\nof a new BMW X5 4.41 automatic motor\r\nvehicle, first registered in the year 2006, and bearing the same\r\nregistration number as reflected\nin the sale agreement. On 13 June\r\n2006, to protect itself against any possible wrongdoing on the part\r\nof its agent SMG, BMW\nserved a third party notice on SMG claiming a\r\ncontribution and indemnification from it. SMG did not oppose this\r\napplication. On\n27 June 2006 BMW filed its answering affidavit. Its\r\nanswer to Mr Singh’s claim for specific performance was that he\r\nhad contracted\nfor a ‘used’ vehicle registered in 2006\r\nand this is what he had received. To support its stance that the\r\nvehicle was\na used one it attached an invoice from SMG dated 9\r\nJanuary 2006 indicating as much. And it also denied that it was the\r\ntitle holder\nof the vehicle because the registration certificate\r\nidentified the title holder incorrectly as being ‘BMW Finanz\r\n(Pty) Ltd\nUmhlanga Rock’ (sic) instead of ‘BMW Financial\r\nServices (Pty) Ltd’, which has its place of business in\r\nMidrand,\nGauteng. In his replying affidavit, which is dated 25 July\r\n2006, Mr Singh expressed astonishment that it was now being alleged\r\nthat he had not bought a new vehicle.\n[11] On 18 January 2007 SMG filed its\r\nanswering affidavit. Regarding the vehicle’s multiple\r\nregistrations, it explained that\nthe vehicle had initially been\r\nerroneously registered in the name of another customer, a Mr Merrick,\r\non 21 October 2005 with\nthe licence number ND 164772. When the\r\nerror was detected the vehicle was re-registered in its name on 27\r\nOctober 2005 under a\ndifferent licence number. The vehicle remained\r\npart of SMG’s stock. Thereafter one of SMG’s directors\r\narranged for\nthe new registration number to be allocated to another\r\nvehicle. This meant that the vehicle had to be re-registered yet\r\nagain –\nthis time under another licence number. It had thus\r\nbeen registered three times. SMG states that its salesman who sold\r\nthe vehicle\nto Mr Singh was unaware of this history. In summary SMG’s\r\ndefence, in contrast to the stance adopted by BMW, was that the\n\nvehicle was new and registered in 2006 (having been erroneously\r\nregistered previously). However, when the matter came to be argued\nin\r\nthe high court, BMW accepted SMG’s facts and also did not\r\npersist with its denial that it was not the title holder of\nthe\r\nvehicle.\n[12] SMG does not, however, explain\r\nhow its invoice to BMW dated 9 January 2006 came to describe the\r\nvehicle as ‘used’.\nNor does it explain the origin of the\r\nlicence number on the agreement, which differs from all the vehicle’s\r\nother licence\nnumbers.\n[13] A year after Mr Singh had\r\ninstituted proceedings the matter had not yet been heard, and it was\r\nno longer possible for the respondents\nto comply with an order for\r\nspecific performance. So, Mr Singh amended his notice of motion. He\r\nnow sought a declaration that the\nagreement was of no force and\r\neffect. He tendered return of the vehicle in his possession and\r\nclaimed repayment of the monies he\nhad paid thus far.\n[14] The high court (Rowan AJ) granted\r\nthe relief claimed. The learned judge found that having been\r\nregistered on three previous\noccasions in 2005 the vehicle was\r\nthereafter not capable of being ‘first registered’ in\r\nApril 2006. He also held that,\nbecause the registration requirement\r\nwas an essential term of the sale agreement, Mr Singh had not\r\nreceived the vehicle for which\nhe had contracted. And it followed,\r\nthe judge said, that as specific performance was no longer possible,\r\nthe appellant was entitled\nto cancel the contract and assert his\r\nright to claim restitution. However, the full court, sitting in\r\nPietermaritzburg, (Niles-Dunér J,\nK. Pillay J and\r\nLopes AJ concurring) reversed that order. Mr Singh now comes on\r\nfurther appeal with special leave of this\ncourt.\n[15] The full court approached the\r\nmatter differently to the high court. First, it considered that Mr\r\nSingh had entered into two\ncontracts: the sale agreement with BMW for\r\nthe purchase of the vehicle, and the oral agreement with SMG in terms\r\nof which the latter\nundertook to register the vehicle on his behalf.\r\nAnd since, in its view, the contracts were severable, if there was a\r\nbreach of\nthe oral agreement this had no bearing on the sale\r\nagreement. Accordingly, so it held, there was no legal basis for Mr\r\nSingh to\nresile from the sale and to claim restitution. Secondly, it\r\nsaid that even if it was a term of the contract between Mr Singh and\n\nBMW that the vehicle was to be ‘first registered’ in\r\n2006, the certificate was procured in April of that year. So,\nit held\r\nthat the obligation had been fulfilled. Thirdly, the date of\r\nregistration, said the full court, had no bearing on the vehicle’s\n\nintrinsic characteristics or qualities, but only on its value. It\r\nthus concluded that if the date of first registration was an\n\nessential element of the contract Mr Singh received what he had\r\ncontracted for. Finally, it held that even if he did not get what\nhe\r\ncontracted for his claim was limited to one for damages against SMG\r\nfor beach (of the second contract) – a claim, said\nthe court,\r\nhe had not and could not make in these proceedings. The full court\r\naccordingly set aside the decision of the high court\nand dismissed\r\nthe claim. It will be convenient to deal with the issues in the same\r\nsequence as the full court did.\n[16] I turn to consider the first\r\nquestion, whether the requirement that the vehicle was to be ‘first\r\nregistered’ in\n2006 was a term of the sale agreement, or a\r\nseparate severable oral agreement or arrangement between Mr Singh and\r\nSMG. In finding\nthat there were two agreements the full court\r\nreasoned that even though the description of the vehicle in the sale\r\nagreement included\na reference to the year of registration, once the\r\nvehicle had been delivered to Mr Singh on 31 December 2005,\r\nBMW’s\nobligation under the sale agreement came to an end. All\r\nthat remained were the registration formalities to be undertaken by\r\nSMG\nafterwards. Moreover, said the full court, because the sale\r\nagreement contained a non-variation clause, there was no room to\r\nimport\na term relating to the registration of the vehicle into it.\n[17] I am unable to agree with the\r\nfull court in this respect. It was an express term of the sale\r\nagreement that the vehicle which\nSMG was to deliver to Mr Singh\r\nwould be ‘first registered’ in 2006. That much is clear\r\non the face of the contract\nitself. As the seller’s agent ‘for\r\npurposes of delivery’ SMG was thus required to deliver a motor\r\nvehicle, which\nbore the registration details provided for in the sale\r\nagreement or was capable of being registered so that it would. I\r\naccept\nthat the delivery of the vehicle and the registration\r\ncertificate did not have to take place simultaneously. But this does\r\nnot\nmean that SMG had a separate agreement with Mr Singh concerning\r\nthe delivery of the certificate. SMG remained the seller’s\n\nagent and was obligated to deliver to the buyer the vehicle and\r\ncertificate of registration as contemplated by the sale agreement.\n\nThere was, therefore, only one agreement – the sale agreement\r\nbetween Mr Singh and BMW.\n[18] As to whether the term was in any\r\nevent fulfilled, as the full court found it had been, by the delivery\r\nof the certificate\nof registration in April 2006 purporting to show\r\nthat the vehicle was registered on 4 April 2006, I also respectfully\r\ndisagree.\nApart from the fact that I have serious reservations\r\nregarding the circumstances of how SMG procured this certificate, and\r\nthe\nthree-month delay in doing so, which was not explained, the\r\ncertificate does not accord with the common cause facts: The printed\n\ncertificate has a standard line, which provides for a ‘date\r\nliable for registration’. The date that was filled in,\nin the\r\nspace provided, was 4 April 2006. There is no explanation in the\r\naffidavits what the ‘date liable for registration’\nrefers\r\nto, but whatever it means, it does not indicate that it is the date\r\nof ‘first registration’. That much is clear\nas the\r\ncertificate allows for the registration date of both new and used\r\nvehicles to be filled in this space. Furthermore, the\ncertificate\r\nprovides for the vehicle’s last three licence numbers to be\r\nfilled in. This indicates that a vehicle could have\nhad previous\r\nlicence numbers and, therefore, a prior registration history. The\r\ncertificate reveals that the vehicle in question\nindeed had three\r\nprevious licence numbers, none of which is the number appearing on\r\nthe sale agreement.\n[19] Mr Marnewick, who appeared for\r\nboth respondents, submitted, though somewhat faintly, that the errors\r\nin the registration had\nbeen explained and that the date 4 April 2006\r\nreflected what the parties had agreed. It may be that the initial\r\nregistration in\nthe name of Mr Merrick was done in error. But\r\nthe vehicle was thereafter registered twice in 2005 –\r\n‘deliberately\nand intentionally’, as Rowan AJ correctly\r\nfound in the high court. The certificate does not reflect the true\r\nfacts. In the\ncircumstances it clearly does not comply with the\r\nrequirement that the vehicle was to be ‘first registered’\r\nin 2006.\n[20] There are two other troubling\r\naspects arising from the certificate. The status of the vehicle is\r\ndescribed as ‘new’.\nBut the respondents do not provide\r\nany explanation why the receipt from SMG to BMW on 9 January 2006\r\nindicates that the vehicle\nwas ‘used’. Indeed in its\r\nanswering affidavit BMW relied on the very receipt to support its\r\nassertion that Mr Singh\nbought the vehicle as ‘used’. BMW\r\nalso initially disavowed the certificate asserting that it was not\r\nthe title holder\nof the vehicle described therein. For present\r\npurposes, because of the rule that in application proceedings the\r\nfacts averred by\nthe respondents must be accepted, I accept that the\r\nvehicle was purchased as new. But this does not detract from the fact\r\nthat\nBMW made false assertions, on oath, without verifying the true\r\nfacts. Its conduct in this regard was reprehensible.\n[21] Once it is found, as I have, that\r\nthe ‘year of first registration 2006’ was an essential\r\nterm of the contract it\nfollows that delivery of the vehicle, which\r\ndid not meet this requirement, was not in accordance with the terms\r\nof the sale agreement.\nBMW’s failure therefore meant that it\r\nwas in breach of the contract.\n[22] This brings me to the third\r\nissue, whether the breach related to the intrinsic qualities of the\r\nvehicle or, put another way,\nwent to the root of the contract. If\r\nnot, as the full court found, Mr Singh was only entitled to claim\r\ndamages to compensate him\nfor the shortcomings. This would be the\r\nsituation where the breach did not affect the substance of what the\r\nbuyer expected to receive.\n[23] Again, I must respectfully join\r\nissue with the approach of the full court. The view I take of the\r\ncontract and of the common\ncause facts is that Mr Singh wanted to\r\npurchase and was promised a particular vehicle, which was new, and\r\nwhich had to be registered\nfor the first time in 2006 –\r\nprobably to secure some financial advantage in the event he decided\r\nto sell the vehicle. It\nmay be that some would consider the\r\nrequirement of ‘first registration’ to be trifling. But\r\nthis is immaterial. If\nthis term was important to the parties, as it\r\nwas in this case, BMW was obliged to comply. It failed to and this\r\nentitles Mr Singh\nto resile from the contract and to claim\r\nrestitution.\n[24] After the dispute arose Mr Singh\r\ncontinued to perform his obligations under the contract by meeting\r\nhis instalment payments\nas and when they became due under the\r\nagreement. When the matter was argued before us on 13 September\r\n2010 we were informed\nthat only one instalment remained. He also\r\ntendered return of the vehicle on 17 March 2006. We were told\r\nthat it remains unused\nand is parked in his garage.\n[25] I turn to consider what the\r\nappropriate order should be. The parties agreed that in the event\r\nthat the appeal succeeded the\ncosts orders of the court of first\r\ninstance should be reinstated. They also concurred that BMW must\r\nrepay all the monies that Mr\nSingh has paid in terms of the agreement\r\nagainst the return by him of the vehicle that was delivered to him.\r\nThey, however, disagreed\non what mora interest should be paid.\n[26] Ms Julyan, who appeared for Mr\r\nSingh, submitted that he is entitled to repayment of the sum of R236\r\n653.81 being the initial\npayment made in terms of the agreement on 22\r\nDecember 2005 together with interest thereon at the rate of 15,5 per\r\ncent calculated\nfrom this date to the date of payment; and also to\r\nrepayment of all instalments paid by Mr Singh, at the same rate of\r\ninterest,\ncalculated from the date of such payment to the date of\r\nrepayment. Ms Julyan cites no authority to support her contention. Mr\r\nSingh\ninitially sought an order for specific performance and\r\ncancelled the agreement only on 3 May 2007. He is, therefore, not\r\nentitled\nto mora interest before this date. So, in respect of the\r\ninitial payment of R236 653.81 and the 16 instalment payments made\r\nuntil\nthen, totalling R127 552.11, mora interest is payable only from\r\n3 May 2007. The total of the two amounts in respect of which mora\n\ninterest is payable as from 3 May 2007 is therefore R364 205.92.\n[27] Concerning the payments made\r\nafter cancellation of the contract, Ms Julyan submitted that Mr\r\nSingh is entitled to interest\non these payments from the date of\r\npayment to the date of repayment. This is, so the submission went,\r\nbecause the payments were\nmade ‘as a matter of commercial\r\nreality . . . under protest’. I am not sure what this means but\r\nonce the contract had\nbeen cancelled, Mr Singh was under no legal\r\nobligation to continue making instalment payments totalling R460\r\n866.05. He is therefore\nonly entitled to claim interest on this\r\namount from the date of this judgment to the date of repayment.\n[28] There remain two other matters.\r\nThe first relates to whether this court should order the costs of\r\nsenior counsel because the\nTaxing Masters in the high courts of\r\nPietermaritzburg and Durban apparently refuse to allow such costs\r\nunless specifically ordered\nto. I accept that this matter involved\r\nsome complexity and it was prudent for both parties to engage the\r\nservices of senior counsel.\nBut this court does not make orders\r\nstipulating that the costs should include the costs of senior\r\ncounsel, and the Uniform Rules\nof Court make no provision for such an\r\norder.\n[29] The second issue concerns the\r\ncondition of the vehicle when it is returned. Mr Marnewick submitted\r\nthat an order for the return\nof the vehicle presupposes that Mr Singh\r\nis able to restore possession in an undamaged and unused condition,\r\nsave for its use before\nthe agreement was cancelled. I do not agree\r\nthat such an order is competent. Once the agreement was cancelled,\r\nand restitution\nwas sought, the risk of the deterioration of the\r\nvehicle’s condition passed to BMW. It must now take possession\r\nof the vehicle\nin the condition that it finds it, subject of course\r\nto Mr Singh not having used it, after the contract was cancelled.\n[30] The following order is made:\n1. The appeal is upheld with costs.\n2. The order of the full court is set\r\naside, and the following order is substituted:\n‘\n2.1 Save for\r\nthe costs orders in paras 3, 4, 5 and 6, the order of the court below\r\nis set aside.\n2.2 The agreement between the\r\napplicant and the first respondent is declared to be cancelled;\n2.3 The applicant is directed to\r\nreturn to the first respondent the BMW vehicle currently in his\r\npossession bearing registration\nletters and numbers ND 595 676, by\r\ndelivering it to the second respondent, against payment in terms of\r\nparagraph 2.4.\n2.4 The first respondent is directed\r\nto:\n2.4.1 repay to the applicant the sum\r\nof R236 653.81, being the initial payment the applicant made to it in\r\nterms of the agreement\ntogether with interest at the rate of 15,5 per\r\ncent per annum from 3 May 2007 to date of payment;\n2.4.2 repay to the applicant the 16\r\ninstalments totalling R127 552.11 paid to it before 3 May 2007\r\nin terms of the agreement\ntogether with interest at the rate of 15,5\r\nper cent per annum from 3 May 2007 to date of payment;\n2.4.3 repay to the applicant all\r\ninstalments paid by the applicant to it in terms of the agreement\r\nafter 3 May 2007, together with\ninterest at 15,5 per cent per annum\r\nfrom the date of this judgment to the date of payment;\n2.5 The first and second respondents\r\nare ordered jointly and severally to pay the costs of the appeal.’\n____________\nA CACHALIA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANTS: J A Julyan SC\nInstructed by Gounder &\r\nAssociates, Durban\nClaude Reid Inc, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT: C G Marnewick SC (1\nst\nand 2\nnd\nrespondents)\nInstructed by John Hudson Attorneys,\r\nDurban\nLovius Block, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, Khoosial Singh, agreed to purchase a new BMW X5 from a dealership, SMG Auto Durban, in December 2005. The sale agreement, signed on 22 December 2005, stipulated that the vehicle would be \"first registered\" in 2006. The vehicle was delivered on 31 December 2005 with temporary licence plates, but it later emerged that the car had already been registered three times in 2005, including once in SMG's name. Singh discovered the prior registrations, raised the issue with SMG, and later with the Registering Authority, learning that the vehicle's status was recorded as \"used\" despite SMG's later certificate stating it was \"new\". Singh sought specific performance for a vehicle first registered in 2006; the High Court granted relief, but the Full Court set it aside. Singh appealed, claiming the registration term was essential and that he was entitled to rescind the contract and obtain restitution of payments made.",
    "issues": "The central issues were: (1) whether the requirement that the vehicle be \"first registered\" in 2006 constituted an essential term of the sale agreement; (2) if that term was breached, whether Singh could rescind the contract and claim restitution; (3) the appropriate measure of interest (mora interest) on the amounts to be repaid; and (4) whether the breach related to an intrinsic quality of the vehicle or merely to its registration date, affecting the nature of the remedy.",
    "principles": "The court applied contract law principles concerning essential terms, holding that a term is essential if the parties regarded it as a condition precedent to the performance of the contract. A breach of an essential term gives rise to the right to rescind and claim restitution. The court also considered the rule that interest on monies repaid in restitution is payable as mora interest only from the date the claimant is entitled to repayment, not from the date of payment. Relevant precedent includes the High Court's approach to essential terms and the doctrine of restitution in instalment sale agreements.",
    "application": "The court found that the \"first registration in 2006\" term was expressly stated in the agreement and was essential to Singh, who relied on it for financial reasons. Because the vehicle had already been registered in 2005, the term was not fulfilled, constituting a breach that went to the root of the contract. Accordingly, the contract was cancelled and Singh was entitled to restitution. The court ordered repayment of the initial deposit and subsequent instalments with mora interest at 15.5% per annum from 3 May 2007 for amounts paid before that date, and from the date of judgment for amounts paid after that date.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The Full Court's order was set aside and substituted with an order cancelling the agreement, directing Singh to return the vehicle to BMW, and ordering BMW to repay the deposit of R236,653.81 and the instalments of R127,552.11 with the stipulated interest. All instalments paid after 3 May 2007 were to be repaid with interest from the date of judgment. The first and second respondents were jointly and severally ordered to pay the costs of the appeal."
