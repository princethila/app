The second respondent,\nMr Christelis, is the husband of the sole member of Northview, a\nclose corporation. He signed the contract on behalf of Revelas.\nThe\nissue before us is whether he was authorized to sign the contract, as\nrequired by\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act 68 of 1981\n. Revelas\ncontends that he was not, as he had no written authority from it, and\nthat the sale is thus invalid for want of formalities.\nNorthview\ncontends, on the other hand, that written authority is not required\nwhen a close corporation is the principal.\n[2]\tNorthview, in its particulars of claim,\nalleged that Christelis was duly authorized to sign the contract,\nwhich is enforceable\nagainst Revelas. It excepted to the claim on two\nbases (and raised several other exceptions, none of which was\nadjudicated by the\nhigh court and that are not before us). First it\nasserted that the claim was vague and embarrassing since it did not\nexpressly aver\nthat Christelis was authorized in writing (the\npleading exception); and second, in the alternative, Revelas asserted\nthat the claim\nlacked averments necessary to sustain an action (the\nsubstantive exception).\n[3]\tBrett AJ in the high court upheld the\nsubstantive exception, saying that he agreed that âif a person\nother than the member acted\non its [the close corporationâs] behalf\nthat person would constitute an agent properly so called within the\nmeaning of the Act\n[s 2(1) of the\nAlienation of Land Act]. More\nover,\nin concluding the agreement relied upon by the plaintiff [Northview]\nthe second defendant [Christelis] purported to âact on\nbehalf of\nthe close corporation ie as an agent and not as its functionary.ââ\nThe high court also upheld the pleading exception\non the basis that\nthere was no allegation that Christelis was authorized in writing,\nand that the written authority should have been\nannexed to the\nparticulars of claim together with the contract of sale. The appeal\nto this court is with Brett AJâs leave.\nThe requirement of written authority under s\n2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act\n[4\n]\tI shall deal first with the finding on the substantive exception.\nSection 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act provides\n:\nâ\nNo\nalienation of land after the commencement of this section shall . . .\nbe of any force or effect unless it is contained in a deed of\nalienation signed by the parties thereto or by their agents acting\non\ntheir written authority.â\nThe provision is not new. It was first included in\ns 30\nof the Transvaal Transfer Duty Proclamation 8 of 1902; was\ncarried into s 1(1) of the General Law Amendment Act 68 of 1957;\nrepeated\nin s 1(1) of the Formalities in Respect of Contracts of Sale\nof Land Act 71 of 1969 and repeated again in the\nAlienation of Land\nAct. Cases\ndealing with the provision span more than a century.\nOf\nparticular importance in this matter are the decisions dealing with\nthe application of the provision where a party to the sale\nis a\njuristic person, which date back at least to 1913 with the landmark\njudgments in\nPotchefstroom Dairies and\nIndustries Co Ltd v Standard Fresh Milk Supply Co\n.\n1\nThe\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\nprinciple\n[5]\tThe question before the court in this case was\nwhether a contract for the sale of land signed by a partner, on\nbehalf of a partnership,\nwas subject to the requirement of\ns 30\nof\nthe Proclamation. De Villiers JP held that the requirement of written\nauthority did not apply where a partner signed for a partnership\nbecause a partner is not an agent of the partn\nership\nwithin the meaning of\ns 30\nof the Proclamation. Partners, he said,\nwere more than agents: a partner âsustains the double character of\nagent and principal\nin one and the same transactionâ.\n2\n[6]\tBristowe J agreed with this conclusion, but\nelaborated also on the application of the written authority\nrequirement in respect\nof other juristic entities, such as companies.\nIt is his judgment that has been the foundation of the principle that\ncorporate entities,\nbeing unable to act other than through natural\npersons, cannot give written authority to their representatives, and\nthat therefore\nthe written authority requirement does not apply when\na functionary of a company signs a contract for the sale of land. It\nis largely\non the interpretation of the following passage that this\nappeal turns.\n[7]\tBristowe J said:\n3\nâ\nUnder that section [s 30 of\nthe Proclamation of 1902] a contract of sale, if not signed by the\nprincipal, must be signed by his agent\nâduly authorised in\nwritingâ. That must, I think, mean âauthorised in writing by the\nprincipalâ. The principal must therefore\nbe capable of giving the\nagent the power which he is appointed to exercise. And for this\npurpose he must be capable of exercising\nthose powers himself.\nMoreover the use of the word âauthorisedâ points I think to an\nexpress authorisation as distinct from one\narising by implication of\nlaw. So that it seems to me that the agency contemplated by the\nsection is one expressly created by a person\nwho could himself have\nexercised the delegated power had he chosen to do so.\nIn this view tutors, curators,\ncorporations and partnerships are all excluded. Tutors and curators\nare excluded because the acts which\nthey are appointed to perform are\nex hypothesi\nacts which their wards cannot perform. Corporations are excluded\nbecause having neither minds nor hands of their own they cannot\nthemselves do what their agents do for them. And partnerships are\nexcluded because the agency of a partner for his co-partner is\nnot\nexpressly created but arises by implication of law as soon as the\npartnership relation is constituted. Not only is this in my\nopinion\nthe effect of the section properly construed, but it seems to me to\nbe a reasonable interpretation and one which accords\nwith the true\nfacts of the case. Tutors and curators are really not agents at all.\nThey are principals, though with limited powers.\nAnd if they enter\ninto a contract of sale they do so by virtue of a faculty incidental\nto their office and not of any power derived\nfrom the ward. So\nalthough the seal of a corporation is affixed by an agent, the seal\nonce affixed is the signature of the corporation.\nAnd quite apart\nfrom the special provisions of the Companies Act it would not be true\nto say that a document  properly sealed with\nthe corporationâs seal\nis executed by an agent. Similarly in the case of a partnership. By\nthe partnership contract a relation\nis established between the\nparties which persists during the continuance of the partnership and\nfor all partnership purposes by virtue\nof which each partner becomes\nprima facie\ncapable\nof signing the firmâs name. The name so signed is really the\nsignature of the firm, though written by one partner; just\nas the\nseal of a company is the signature of the company though affixed by\nan agent.â\n[8]\tThe principle expressed in this passage has been applied\nconsistently since then to companies, partnerships and co-operative\nsocieties. And as counsel for Northview points out, it has been\nviewed against all the different provisions enacted from time to\ntime\nthat require an agent to have written authorization in order to bind\na principal to a contract for the sale of land.\n[9]\tIn\nSuid\nAfrikaanse Sentrale KoÃ¶peratiewe Graanmaatskappy Bpk v Thanasaris\n4\nMurray J, having set out the reasoning of De Villiers JP in\nPotchefstroom Dairies\nsaid:\nâ\nThe concurring judgment of\nBristowe J is to the same effect, and goes further by expressing the\nview that the reasoning for the exclusion\nof partners from the\noperation of the section is equally applicable to exclude\ncorporations as well: the agency contemplated by the\nsection is one\nexpressly created by a person who could himself if so minded have\nexercised the power which he has elected to delegate.\nTutors,\ncurators, corporations and partners are excluded from the section;\ntutors and curators because the acts they are appointed\nto perform\nare acts which\nex\nhypothesi\ntheir wards\ncannot perform; partnerships because the agency of a partner for his\nco-partner is not expressly created but arises by\nimplication of the\nlaw on the constitution of the partnership relation. âCorporations\nare excluded because having neither minds\nnor hands of their own they\ncannot do what their agents do for them.ââ\n[10]\tTrusts are treated differently, however. In\nThorpe v Trittenwein\n5\nthis court held that a trustee who did not have the written authority\nof co-trustees to sign a contract for the sale of land did\nnot bind\nthe trust. Scott JA said that the position was different from that of\na partnership. Trustees, unlike partners, are required\nto act\njointly. He said:\n6\nâ\nAs previously indicated the\nvery object of s 2(1) of the Act [the\nAlienation of Land Act] is\non\ngrounds of public policy to facilitate that proof by requiring the\nauthority to be in writing and so avoid needless litigation.\nWhether\none regards Thorpe [the trustee who had signed the contract for the\ntrust] as having acted as a functionary of the trust\nand in that\nsense a principal or as both a principal (as co-trustee) and agent of\nthe other co-trustees, the result in my view must\nbe the same. Given\nthe object of the section, it must be construed, I think, as being\napplicable on either basis. In other words,\nthe reference in the\nsection to âagentsâ must be understood as including a trustee who\nmay in a sense be said to sign as a principal\n(ie as the trust), but\nwhose power to bind the trust is nonetheless dependent upon the\nauthority of the co-trustees. To do otherwise\nwould be to thwart the\nclear object of the section. It follows that in my view the agreement\nof sale (as supplemented by the addenda)\nis void\nab\ninitio\nand of no\nforce and effect.â\n[11]\tThere is nothing to suggest that the\nPotchefstroom Dairies\nprinciple is incorrect in so far as juristic persons generally are\nconcerned. And, as already pointed out, it has been applied for\nnearly a century. The only question is whether it applies to an agent\nof a close corporation who is not a member. Before dealing\nwith the\ndifferences between provisions governing companies and those\ngoverning close corporations, I should make it clear that there\nis in\nmy view no difference in principle between a person authorized by\nvirtue of his or her position within a company, on the one\nhand, and\none who is a member of a close corporation on the other, to sign a\ncontract for the sale of land. A member of a close corporation,\nauthorized as such to sign, is in the same position as a functionary\nof a company authorized to sign (both without requiring written\nauthority). For the sake of convenience I refer to a person\nauthorized by law (or the internal rules of a juristic entity) as a\nâfunctionaryâ,\nso as to distinguish his or her position from that\nof an agent authorized by expression of will (sometimes referred to\nas an âoutside\nagentâ). Thus at issue in this appeal is whether\nan agent, as opposed to a functionary, can bind a close corporation\nto a contract\nfor the sale of immovable property where there is no\nwritten authority to do so.\nSection 69 of the Companies Act\n[12]\tThe question of written authority in so far as companies is\nconcerned is regulated by the provisions of the Companies Act 61\nof\n1973. Section 69 reads:\nâ\nContracts by companies. â\n(1) Contracts on behalf of a company may be made as follows:\nAny contract which if made\n\tbetween individual persons would by law be required to be in writing\n\tsigned by the parties to be charged\ntherewith may be made on behalf\n\tof the company in writing signed by any person acting under its\n\tauthority, expressed or implied,\nand may in the same manner be\n\tvaried or discharged;\nany contract which if made\n\tbetween individual persons would by law be valid though made orally\n\tonly and not reduced to writing,\nmay be made orally on behalf of the\n\tcompany by any person acting under its authority, expressed or\n\timplied, and may in the same\nmanner be varied or discharged.\n(2) All contracts made in\naccordance with this section shall be effectual in law and shall bind\nthe company and its successors and\nall other parties thereto.â\n[13]\tSection 69 was preceded by s 72(1)(a) of the\nCompanies Act 46 of 1926, which itself replaced s 74(1) of the\nCompanies Act 31\nof 1909. Thus for a long period any agent of a\ncompany, whether or not a functionary of the company, has, it is\nargued, been able\nto bind the company to a contract for the sale of\nland without written authority by virtue of the provisions of s 69\nand without\nreference to the\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\nprinciple.\n[14]\tNorthviewâs argument is thus that had\nChristelis been representing a company, he would have been able to\nbind it on his signature.\nI have some doubt about whether s 69 was\never intended to apply to a person who is not a functionary of a\ncompany and who does not\nhave authority by virtue of his or her\nposition within the company, in terms of the companyâs articles of\nassociation or in terms\nof a resolution of the company. It is so,\nhowever, that the decisions based on\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\ndo not deal with that\nsituation: all deal with functionaries of a juristic person such as\ncompany secretaries, and partners. See,\nfor example,\nTrever\nInvestments (Pty) Ltd v Friedhelm Investments (Pty) Ltd\n7\nwhere Trollip JA, referring to\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\nand cases applying it, said\nthat parol evidence was admissible to prove that the signatory to a\ncontract for the sale of land had\nâthe necessary\nimplied\nauthorityâ (my emphasis). He continued: âAfter all, in most cases\nthat is the only way in which âimplied authorityâ, permitted\nby\n[s 69] of the Companies Act, could be established.â The signatory\nwas a director of the company concerned.\n[15]\tHowever, the meaning of s 69 and its ambit\nwere not debated before us: it was assumed that any agent for a\ncompany, whether authorized\nby law or by mandate, does not require\nwritten authority to bind a company to a contract for the sale of\nland.\n8\nNo finding in this regard is made.\nContracts concluded on behalf of close corporations\n[16]\tThere is no provision equivalent to s 69 in\nthe Close Corporations Act 6\n9 of 1984. Is\nthere any reason to treat close corporations differently? The Close\nCorporations Act confers on members the power to\nbind the close\ncorporation. Section 54 provides:\n9\nâ\n(1) Subject to the provisions\nof this section, any member of a corporation shall in relation to a\nperson who is not a member and is\ndealing with the corporation, be an\nagent of the corporation.\n(2) Any act of a member shall\nbind a corporation whether or not such act is performed for the\ncarrying on of the business of the corporation\nunless the member so\nacting has in fact no power to act for the corporation in the\nparticular matter and the person with whom the\nmember deals has, or\nought reasonably to have, knowledge of the fact that the member has\nno such power.â\n[17]\tSection 54(2) does no more than express the\nusual rules relating to ostensible authority. And s 54(1) simply\nconfers on a member\nauthority\nto act for a\nclose corporation, as the common law confers on a partner the power\nto bind the partnership. The section does not regulate\nthe question\nof written authority for the purpose of\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of\nLand Act, as\nit is assumed s 69 of the Companies Act does. It is\nclear, however, that on the reasoning in\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\na member, who by law can\nrepresent a close corporation, need not have written authority. But\nwhy should that be true of an agent\nof the close corporation who is\nnot a member, as is the case with Christelis?\n[18]\tAssuming that Christelis did not have written\nauthority to sign the deed of sale, did he bind Revelas? Counsel for\nRevelas argues\nthat only Mrs Christelis, the member, had the power to\nbind the corporation. The basis of the argument is that\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\ndeals with situations where the\njuristic person can act only through a natural person, who has\nauthority by virtue of his or her\nposition to bind the entity â\nthat is where the principal cannot itself act, as in the case of\ncompanies that have no âminds\nnor hands of their ownâ. So too,\ntutors and curators act for persons who have no, or limited, legal\ncapacity. In this case, Revelas\ncould act through Mrs Christelis. And\nshe could have given Christelis written authority to sign the\nagreement of sale. The\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\nprinciple does not, therefore,\napply.\n[19]\tThe argument is thus that where there is no\nimplication of authority by law (as with a company director or\nsecretary, or a close\ncorporation member â who would all fall in\nthe class of functionaries of the juristic entity) written authority,\nas required for\nan agent under\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act\ni\ns necessary. In the first class there is a\nprimary attribution of authority â by statute or other instrument.\nIn the second class\nthere is a secondary rule of attribution â\nauthority conferred by the expression of will. In the latter class\nthere must be written\nauthority to comply with\ns 2(1).\nThe rules\nof\nattribution\n[20]\tCounsel for Revelas cites in this regard a\ndecision of the Privy Council:\nMeridian\nGlobal Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission\n.\n10\nLord\nHoffman, delivering the judgment of the Council, explained that a\ncompany exists as a legal fiction because of certain rules.\nAnd a\ncompany runs in accordance with rules which tell one which acts are\nthose of the company. He said:\n11\nâ\nIt is\ntherefore a necessary part of corporate personality that there should\nbe rules by which acts are attributed to the company.\nThese may be\ncalled the ârules of attribution\nâ.â\nLord Hoffman continued:\n12\nâ\nThe companyâs primary rules\nof attribution will generally be found in its constitution, typically\nthe articles of association, and\nwill say things such as âfor the\npurpose of appointing members of the board, a majority vote of the\nshareholders shall be a decision\nof the companyâ or âthe\ndecisions of the board in managing the companyâs business shall be\nthe decisions of the companyâ\nThere are also primary rules of\nattribution which are not expressly stated in the articles but\nimplied by company law, such as\nâ\nthe\nunanimous decision of all the shareholders in a solvent company about\nanything which the company under its memorandum of association\nhas\npower to do shall be the decision of the companyâ: see\nMultinational\nGas and Petrochemical Co. v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical\nServices Ltd\n[1983]\nCh 258.\nThese primary rules of\nattribution are obviously not enough to enable a company to go out\ninto the world and do business. Not every\nact on behalf of the\ncompany could be expected to be the subject of a resolution of the\nboard or a unanimous decision of the shareholders.\nThe company\ntherefore builds upon the primary rules of attribution by using\ngeneral rules of attribution which are equally available\nto natural\nperson, namely, the principles of agency. It will appoint servants\nand agents whose acts, by a combination of the general\nprinciples of\nagency and the companyâs primary rules of attribution, count as the\nacts of the company.  And having done so, it\nwill also make itself\nsubject to the general rules by which liability for the acts of\nothers can be attributed to natural persons,\nsuch as estoppel or\nostensible authority in contract and vicarious liability in tort.\nIt is worth pausing at this\nstage to make what may seem an obvious point. Any statement about\nwhat a company has or has not done,\nor can or cannot do, is\nnecessarily a reference to the rules of attribution (primary and\ngeneral) as they apply to that company.\nJudges sometimes say that a\ncompany âas suchâ cannot do anything; it must act by servants or\nagents. This may seem an unexceptionable,\neven banal remark. And of\ncourse the meaning is usually perfectly clear. But a reference to a\ncompany âas suchâ might suggest\nthat there is something out there\ncalled the company of which one can meaningfully say that it can or\ncannot do something. There\nis in fact no such thing as the company as\nsuch, no ding an sich, only the applicable rules. To say that a\ncompany cannot do something\nmeans only that there is no one whose\ndoing of that act would, under the applicable rules of attribution\ncount as an act of the company.\nThe companyâs primary rules of\nattribution together with the general principles of agency, vicarious\nliability and so forth are\nusually sufficient to enable one to\ndetermine its rights and obligations. In exceptional cases, however,\nthey will not provide an\nanswer. This will be the case when a rule of\nlaw, either expressly or by implication, excludes attribution on the\nbasis of the general\nprinciples of agency or vicarious liability. For\nexample, a rule may be stated in language primarily applicable to a\nnatural person\nand require some act or state of mind on the part of\nthat person âhimselfâ, as opposed to his servants or agents. This\nis generally\ntrue of rules of the criminal law, which ordinarily\nimpose liability only for the actus reus and mens rea of the\ndefendant himself.\nHow is such a rule to be applied to a company?\nOne\npossibility is that the court may come to the conclusion that the\nrule was not intended to apply to companies at all; for example,\na\nlaw which created an offence for which the only penalty was community\nservice. Another possibility is that the court might interpret\nthe\nlaw as meaning that it could apply to a company only on the basis of\nits primary rules of attribution, ie if the act giving rise\nto\nliability was specifically authorised by a resolution of the board or\nan unanimous agreement of the shareholders. But there will\nbe many\ncases in which neither of these solutions is satisfactory; in which\nthe court considers that the law was intended to apply\nto companies\nand that, although it excludes ordinary vicarious liability,\ninsistence on the primary rules of attribution would in\npractice\ndefeat that intention. In such a case, the court must fashion a\nspecial rule of attribution for the particular substantive\nrule. This\nis always a matter of interpretation: given that it was intended to\napply to a company, how was it intended to apply?\nWhose act (or\nknowledge, or state of mind) was\nfor\nthis purpose\nintended to count as the act etc of the company? One finds the answer\nto this question by applying the usual canons of interpretation,\ntaking into account the language of the rule (if it is a statute) and\nits content and policy.â\n[21]\tCounsel for Northview argues that the rules\nof attribution expressed in\nMeridian\nare not part of South African law. It seems to me, however, that they\nare simply rules of logic. And in any event, I consider that\nthey are\nexpressed (although more concisely) by Bristowe J in\nPotchefstroom\nDairies\nwhere he said:\nâ\nMoreover the use of the word\nâauthorisedâ points I think to an\nexpress\nauthorisation as distinct from one arising by implication of law.\nSo\nthat it seems to me that\nthe agency contemplated by the section is one expressly created by a\nperson who could himself have exercised the delegated power\nhad he\nchosen to do so\nâ\n(my emphasis).\n[22]\tAuthority arising by implication of law in\nthis context is that conferred by statute, by the rules of the\njuristic entity (in\narticles of association, for example) or by the\ncommon law in relation to partners. An express authorization is one\ngiven to an agent\nby a principal who can act for him or herself. In\nthe case of a close corporation the logical principle should in my\nview prevail:\na member who is given authority by statute to bind it\nneeds no written authority.\n13\nBut if a member authorizes an agent to enter into a contract for the\nsale of land on behalf of the close corporation he or she must\ndo so\nin writing.\n[23]\tThe logic of the principle is made clear by\nan example dealing with a partnership. Assume a partnership of\ndoctors. It owns immovable\nproperty from which the doctors practise.\nThey decide to sell the property. Any one of the partners, by virtue\nof his or her position\nas a partner, may sign the deed of sale\nwithout any written authority from the others. But if they instruct\ntheir bookkeeper, or\nreceptionist, to sign the deed that instruction\nmust surely be in writing in order for the partnership to be bound. A\nclose corporation\nmust likewise, through a member, give its attorney\nor other agent written authority to sign the deed.\nAnomalies arising from treating companies and close corporations\ndifferently\n[24]\tNorthview argues that such a conclusion is\nanomalous. Why should the position be different as between companies\nand close corporations?\nI consider that there is no anomaly.\nThere may be a difference but there is no deviation from the norm.\nThe argument begs the question as to whether there is a norm.\nThe\nfirst reason for the difference lies in the very fact that the Close\nCorporations Act does not include the equivalent of s 69\n(whatever\nits ambit is). We must assume that the omission of an equivalent\nprovision is deliberate. And secondly, even if there is\nan anomalous\ndifference, the anomaly is no more significant than that which arises\nif one treats people differently from close corporations.\nIf A, a\nhuman being, authorizes B, an agent, to sign a contract for the sale\nof land, the authorization must be in writing. It would\nbe\nextraordinary if A, the sole member of a close corporation, could\norally (or perhaps even by conduct) authorize B, an agent, to\nsign\nsuch a contract.\n[25]\tMoreover, a close corporation is intended to\nbe a simple entity, akin to a partnership, but with limited\nliability.\n14\nThe structure of a close corporation is designed for individual\nentrepeneurs or for a limited number of people (10) to conduct\nbusiness.\nThere is no board of directors and each member has the\npower to bind the close corporation, as discussed above. The complex\nrequirements\nof company law are not intended to apply to them.\n15\nThe fallacy in Northviewâs argument arises through comparing close\ncorporations with companies rather than with partnerships or\nindividuals. It is partnership principles rather than company law\nprinciples that govern the relationship between members.\n16\nIt follows that a member, like a partner, need not have written\nauthority to enter into a contract for the sale of land. But where\na\npartner or a member authorizes a third person (an agent in the true\nsense) to enter into such a contract the authorization must\nbe in\nwriting.\nAchiev\ning the\nobject of\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act\n[26\n]\tThe object of\ns 2(1)\nof the\nAlienation of\nLand Act is\nto ensure certainty in respect of contracts for the sale\nof land. That object is not defeated if a functionary of a company or\na\nclose corporation or any other juristic entity signs such a\ncontract. There is no uncertainty about the functionaryâs\nauthority.\nIt derives from law. In Bristowe Jâs words,\n17\nthe authority âarises by implication of lawâ. But where the\nauthority arises from the expression of will (an âexpress\nauthorizationâ)\nit must be in writing. If it were not, the\nuncertainty as to the authority would defeat the object of the\nsection.\n[27]\tI conclude, thus, that in the absence of\nwritten authority given to Christelis by the member of Revelas, the\ncontract for the\nsale of the property was invalid. The substantive\nexception was thus correctly upheld by the high court.\nThe pleading exception\n[28]\tIn so far as the pleading exception is\nconcerned â that the written authority was not attached to the\nparticulars of claim,\nand that the claim was thus vague and\nembarrassing â my view is that it was sufficient for Northview to\nplead that Christelis was\nâduly authorizedâ. Such an allegation\nimplies proper compliance with the requirement of written authority\nand Revelas could have\ndenied that in its plea.  There is ample\nauthority for the proposition that the denial of an agentâs\nauthority is a special defence\nand must be specifically pleaded.\n18\nThe finding that that exception was correctly taken was thus not\ncorrect, and in any event would not be appealable given that it\nwas\nnot final in effect.\n[29]\nThe appeal is\ndismissed with costs.\n______________\nC H Lewis\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT\n:\t\t\tW Trengove\nSC\nM Chaskalson  SC\nInstructed by Derek Mazaham Attorneys\n\t\t\t\t\tJohannesburg\nLovius Block Attorneys\nBloemfontein.\nRESPONDENTS\n:\t\t\tJ Peter\nInstructed by Cuzen Randeree Attorneys\nJohannesburg\nMcIntyre & van\nder Post\nBloemfontein.\n1\n1913 TPD 506.\n2\nAt 511.\n3\nAt 512-513.\n4\n1953 (2) SA 314\n(W) at 317B-E.

  "sections": {
    "facts": "The appellant, Northview Shopping Centre (Pty) Ltd, sought specific performance of a contract for the sale of immovable property that it alleged it had purchased from Revelas Properties Johannesburg CC. The contract had been signed by Mr. Nick Christelis, the husband of the sole member of Northview, who signed on behalf of Revelas. The dispute centred on whether Christelis, who was not a member of the close corporation, had the necessary written authority under section 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act to bind Revelas to the sale.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was whether an agent of a close corporation who is not a member must have written authority to execute a contract for the sale of land, as required by s 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act. A subsidiary issue concerned a pleading exception alleging that the claim was vague for not attaching written authority.",
    "principles": "The court reaffirmed the requirement of written authority in s 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act and applied the Potchefstroom Dairies principle as articulated by Bristowe J, distinguishing between a functionary (member or corporate officer) who can bind the entity without written authority and an ‘outside agent’ who must have express written authority. The judgment examined the analogous provisions in the Companies Act (s 69) and the Close Corporations Act (s 54), concluding that while members (functionaries) need no written authority, agents of a close corporation who are not members require it.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that Christelis was an agent of Revelas who was not a member and had no written authority to sign the deed of sale. Consequently, the contract was void ab initio under s 2(1). The substantive exception raised by Revelas was therefore correctly upheld. The pleading exception was held to be incorrectly decided, but it was not appealed as a final order.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The contract for sale was declared invalid due to lack of written authority, and Northview’s claim for specific performance failed."
