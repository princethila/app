On\nthe\nsame day each was sentenced to 12 monthsâ imprisonment on the first\ncount, and to life imprisonment in respect of the second.\n[2]\tThe present appeal is before us\nwith the leave of the court below. The appellants appeal against\ntheir convictions and the sentence\nof life imprisonment and the\nState, against the sentence in relation to the kidnapping conviction.\nThe appellants contend that the\nformer sentence is too severe and the\nState, that the latter is too lenient.\n[3]\tThe primary question for\nconsideration is whether the court below, in coming to the\nconclusions referred to above, correctly assessed\nthe evidence in\nrelation to each count. Of particular importance in this regard is\nthe approach to be adopted insofar as circumstantial\nevidence is\nconcerned. I turn to deal with the material facts.\n[4]\tIt is common cause that the badly\ndisfigured body of the deceased was found on the N1 national highway\nnear Vanderbijlpark, during\nthe early morning hours of 24 May 2000,\nin circumstances that appeared as if he had been the fatal victim of\na hit-and-run motorist.\n[5]\tThe events that occurred shortly\nbefore and in the weeks leading up to the discovery of the deceasedâs\nbody are important. They\nare set out hereafter.\n[6]\tThe deceased was a ticket seller\nin Pretoria, for Putco, a bus company. Two to three months before the\ndiscovery of the deceasedâs\nbody there had been a theft of R1, 2 m\nfrom the Putco office where the deceased had been employed. The theft\nwas reported to the\nSouth African Police Services (SAPS) and private\ninvestigators, Associated Intelligence Network (AIN), were appointed\nby Putco in\nan attempt to find the perpetrators.\n[7]\tAs a result of polygraph tests\nconducted by AIN, several Putco employees were identified as possible\nsuspects, including the deceased\nand Mr Titus Seboka. These\ntests were conducted on 16 May 2000.\n[8]\tThe lines between the\ninvestigations by the police and AIN, respectively, became blurred.\nFor eg, Mr Henry Beukes, who was accused\n1 in the court below and who\nwas discharged at the end of the Stateâs case, was employed âin a\ntemporary capacityâ by AIN whilst\nin the employ of SAPS and whilst\nhe was on âsick leaveâ. In colloquial language, Mr Beukes appears\nto have been âmoonlightingâ.\nAs will become apparent from what\nappears later in this judgment it is not altogether clear whether\nparticular instructions issued\nwere at the instance of  the police or\nby AIN.\n[9]\tOn 18 May 2000 Mr Beukes was\ninformed that an unauthorised ticketing machine had been found in the\ndeceasedâs possession.\n[10]\tOn 22 May 2000, whilst he was on\nâsick leaveâ, Mr Beukes, apparently acting on behalf of AIN,\nrequested the assistance of\nthe three appellants, in their capacities\nas police officials.  It was this request that led to their encounter\nwith the deceased.\n[11]\tMr Beukes had ascertained that a\nwarrant of arrest had been issued in respect of Mr Seboka, unrelated\nto the theft from Putco.\nHe decided that this presented an\nopportunity for the police to interrogate Mr Seboka concerning the\ntheft. In his statement in explanation\nof his plea of not guilty in\nthe court below, Mr Beukes stated the following:\nâ\nIt is a well-known\nfact in the police that when a person is in detention such a person\nis more willing to co-operate with the police\nand divulge full\ninformation to the police than otherwiseâ¦.â\nI shall, in due course, comment on\nthe âwell-known factâ referred to by Mr Beukes and its\napplication in the present case and\ngenerally.\n[12]\tIt is common cause that during\nthe night of 22 May 2000, leading into the morning of 23 May 2000, Mr\nBeukes and the three appellants,\nin search of Mr Seboka, went to\nhis parentsâ home in Atteridgeville, Pretoria. They did not find\nhim there. According to the\ntestimony of the first and third\nappellants, this caused them, in consultation with Mr Beukes, to\ndecide to go to the deceasedâs\nhouse to see if he could lead them\nto Mr Seboka.\n[13]\tThe three appellants travelled to\nthe deceasedâs house In Atteridgeville. They woke him and\nidentified themselves as policemen.\nThey told him that they were\nthere to âpick him upâ to question him about the theft at Putco.\nMs Stella Motileng, the deceasedâs\ngirlfriend and his brother,\nMr Benson Botomane, were present. The deceased was instructed to get\ndressed. He complied and accompanied\nthem to their vehicle.\n[14]\tThe appellants, upon enquiry from\nthe deceasedâs girlfriend and his brother, said that they were\ntaking him to the Atteridgeville\npolice station. According to Ms\nMotileng she specifically directed her question to the second\nappellant and he responded by stating\nthat they were taking the\ndeceased to the Atteridgeville police station. The deceased entered\nthe police vehicle and they drove off\nwith him.\n[15]\tImportantly, as the deceased\ndeparted with the police he told his girlfriend, who was concerned\nabout his safety, that he had\nhis cellular telephone and would call\nher, if necessary. The deceased left his house with the three\nappellants shortly after 02h00\non the morning of 23 May 2000. It is\ncommon cause that the appellants did not take him to any police\nstation.\n[16]\tThe first and third appellants\ntestified that whilst they were in the deceasedâs house they\ndeliberately did not disclose before\nother members of the deceasedâs\nhousehold that they were seeking his assistance to find Mr Seboka, in\norder to prevent any one\nof them alerting the latter.\n[17]\tAfter he departed and left the\nhouse with the appellants no member of the deceasedâs household or\nfamily heard from him or\nsaw him alive again. As to what occurred\nafter the deceased left his house we only have the version of the\nfirst and third appellants\nâ the second appellant, Mr Felokwane\nGoqo, did not testify and the State presented no other evidence in\nthis regard. According\nto those two appellants they questioned the\ndeceased in the motor vehicle about Mr Sebokaâs whereabouts.\nIn response he volunteered\nto help them locate Mr Seboka.\n[18]  \tAccording to the two\nappellants, the deceased first led them to a house in Atteridgeville.\nThe deceased then noted that Sebokaâs\nvehicle was not there and\nconsequently directed them to an address in Sebokeng. There, he\nalighted from the vehicle ostensibly to\nenable him to ascertain\nwhether Sebokaâs vehicle was on the premises. Suddenly he fled. It\nwas dark and they were unsuccessful\nin their pursuit of him. They did\nnot see him alive again.\n[19]\tThe deceasedâs body was found\non the N1 national highway near Sebokeng approximately 26 hours after\nhe had left his house to\naccompany the three appellants.\n[20]\tMakhafola AJ considered the\nevents set out above and the testimony of the first and third\nappellants. He rejected their version\nof events as palpably false. He\nhad regard to the improbabilities in their evidence and the\ncontradictions between their evidence\nin court and written statements\nthey had made.\n2\nHe had regard to entries in the personal diary of the first\nappellant, made some time after the events of the night on which they\nconfronted the deceased, and considered that it contradicted evidence\nin court on behalf of the appellants in relation to events\nafter the\ndeceased had allegedly fled.\n[21]\tThe learned judge in the court\nbelow took into account that the third appellant, in the presence of\nwitnesses, had falsely said\nthat they were taking the deceased to the\nAtterridgeville police station. He reasoned that they had induced the\ndeceased to go with\nthem under false pretences, bringing him under\nthe impression that he was being arrested and concluded that they\nwere thus guilty\nof kidnapping him. He held it against the second\nappellant that he did not take the court into his confidence but\nchose rather not\nto testify. He rejected the alibi evidence proffered\non behalf of the first appellant, that he had been on a police\noperation in\nSoweto during the night of 23 May 2000 into the early\nhours of the morning of 24 May 2000.\n[22]\tMakhafola AJ was acutely aware of\nthe fact that he was convicting the three appellants on the murder\ncharge based on circumstantial\nevidence. After listing aspects of\ntheir evidence that he found unsatisfactory and rejecting the alibi\nevidence he concluded rather\ncryptically as follows:\nâ\nTo my mind,\ncircumstantially, the cumulative effect of these elements of proof is\noverwhelmingly unassailable and it establishes beyond\na reasonable\ndoubt the existence of the\ncorpus\ndelicti\nas\nwell as the accusedsâ actions in willfully and maliciously being\nits cause. In the totality of all the circumstances the accused\nare\nnot excluded from having caused the death of the deceased. I find\nthat the accused caused the death of the deceased.â\n[23]\tIt is common cause that multiple\ninjuries caused the deceasedâs death. It is not in dispute that the\ndeceased died somewhere\nbetween 23h00 on 23 May 2000 and\n03h40 on 24 May 2000. More importantly, it is uncontested that the\ninjuries sustained\nare consistent with those that might have been\nsustained in a hit-and-run collision as well as being consistent with\nthe deceased\nbeing killed elsewhere and left injured or dead on the\nnational highway.\n[24]\tA further fact that does not\nappear to be in dispute is that the deceased had confided to his\ngirlfriend, a week before his death,\nthat his life was under threat.\nThis was related to the illegal ticket machine found in his cubicle\nand to certain persons connected\ntherewith, who had offered him R10\n000 not to reveal their identities. According to Ms Motileng the\ndeceased had told her that the\nmachine found in his cubicle belonged\nto Mr Seboka.\n[25]\tMr Seboka testified that his car\nhad been parked at his house in Atteridgeville on the night when he\nwas being sought by the\nappellants and that it was visible from the\nstreet. The suggestion is that the police must be untruthful about\nthe reason for seeking\nthe deceasedâs assistance in locating Mr\nSeboka. Counsel for the appellants correctly submitted that Mr Seboka\nwas an unimpressive\nand patently dishonest witness. His evidence on\nmaterial aspects is unreliable. As stated above, it is clear from the\nstatements\nthey made with the assistance of their attorney that the\nappellants were looking to arrest Mr Seboka. This is substantiated by\ntheir\nvisit to his parentsâ house. It is unlikely that they would\nhave passed up the opportunity to arrest him at his house had he been\nthere.\n[26]\tIn P J Schwikkard and S E Van der\nMerwe\nPrinciples of Evidence\n3 ed (2009) at p 21 para 2 9 the following appears:\nâ\nCircumstantial\nevidence often forms an important component of the information\nfurnished to the court. In these instances the court\nis required to\ndraw inferences, because the witnesses have made no direct assertions\nwith regard to the fact in issue. These inferences\nmust comply with\ncertain rules of logic.â\n[27]\tCircumstantial evidence is\ndescribed as follows in C W H Schmidt\nBewysreg\n4 ed (2000) at p 101:\nâ\nOmstandigheidsgetuienis\nis getuienis van ân feit of feite waaruit ân afleiding omtrent\ndie primÃªre feite in geskil gemaak kan\nword.â\nLater the following appears:\nâ\nBy die uiteindelike\nbeoordeling van ân strafsaak, waar die bewyslas soos normaalweg die\ngeval is, op die staat rus, kan ân feit\nin geskil deur\nomstandigheidsgetuienis bewys word slegs indien (i) die afleiding wat\ndie staat bepleit met al die bewese feite versoenbaar\nis en (ii) geen\nander redelike afleiding uit daardie feite gemaak kan word nie.â\nThis, of course, is distilled from\nR\nv Blom\n1939 AD 188\nat\n202-203 and are the rules of logic referred to in the preceding\nparagraph.\n3\n[28]\tHaving regard to the uncertainty\nconcerning the cause of death and considering that there were threats\nagainst the deceasedâs\nlife from other quarters and that the\nevidence in relation to what occurred after the deceased entered the\npolice vehicle up until\nhe allegedly fled is uncontested, and lastly\nthat there is no evidence of any kind that there had been any contact\nbetween the deceased\nand the appellants in the intervening 26 hours,\nthe conclusion reached by the court below in respect of the murder\ncharge is unjustified.\nThe conclusion is not in accordance with the\nrules of logic set out in\nR\nv Blom\n.\n[29]\tThe criticisms by Makhafola AJ of\nthe evidence on behalf of the appellants are largely justified. Their\nearlier written statements\ncrafted under the guidance of their\nattorney contradict their evidence that the search for and the\ninterrogation of the deceased\nwas not premeditated. A consideration\nof the alibi evidence reveals that the conclusion reached by the\ncourt in this regard is justified.\nI do not intend to deal with the\ndetails thereof. However, it does not necessarily follow that their\nlies on these aspects warrant\nthe conclusion reached by the court\nbelow.\n[30]\tThere might be suitable cases in\nwhich it is safe to conclude that lies, together with other\nacceptable evidence, prove the guilt\nof an accused. However, courts\nshould be careful to decide against an accused merely as punishment\nfor untruthful evidence. In\nS\nv Mtsweni\n1985 (1) SA 590\n(A) at 594E-F the following is stated:\nâ\nVoordat ân\nskuldigbevinding aan moord kan geskied moet daar bewese feite wees\nwat by wyse van afleiding die appellant aan die dood\nvan die\noorledene koppel. By ontstentenis daarvan bestaan daar nie ân\nprima\nfacie\nsaak teen die appellant nie, en kan sy leuenagtige getuienis, net\nsoos in die geval waar hy nie getuig nie, nie die leemtes in die\nStaat se saak aanvul en ân gevolgtrekking van skuld regverdig nie.â\n[31]\tAs indicated above the inference\nthat the appellants caused the death of the deceased is not an\ninference that can be drawn in\nthe face of the proved facts referred\nto in paras 23, 24 and 28. Consequently the conviction on the murder\ncount cannot stand.\n[32]\t I turn to deal with the\nkidnapping conviction. The offence is defined as the intentional\nunlawful deprivation of the liberty\nof a person.\n4\nOf course, if the deceased consented or volunteered to accompany the\nappellants a conviction would not be warranted.\n[33]\tAfter the appellants identified\nthemselves as policemen they asked the deceased to come with them.\nAfter some debate with his\ngirlfriend he told her that he thought it\nbetter to go with them because they were policemen. They did not\neffect an arrest.\n[34]\tThe policemen behaved coarsely\nand were overbearing when they encountered the deceased in his house\nfor the first time. There\nis no countervailing evidence to the\nversion presented by the appellants that, when the deceased was told\nthey were looking for Mr\nSeboka he volunteered to help them locate\nthe latter and that he subsequently fled. It cannot be said that\ntheir version on this\naspect is not reasonably possibly true and it\nimpacts on both the murder and kidnapping count. As indicated above,\nthere is no evidence\nlinking the deceased to the appellants during\nthe day before his body was discovered. Once one accepts that the\ndeceased volunteered\nto accompany the appellants as soon as he was\ntold that they were looking for Mr Seboka, (moments after they had\ncome out of his\nhouse), the kidnapping conviction cannot be\nsustained.\n[35]\tIn light of the conclusions set\nout above it is not necessary to deal with the sentences imposed by\nthe court below.\n[36]\tThere are remaining aspects I\nintend to address. First, there is the question of the âwell-known\nfactâ referred to in para\n11 above, namely, that when a person is\nin detention he is more likely to co-operate and divulge information\nto the police.\n[37]\tMr Jasper Johannes Prinsloo, a\nformer policeman, who at some stage was involved in the AIN\ninvestigation into the Putco theft,\ntestified in the court below\nabout this. The following passages reflect what was put to him under\ncross-examination and his responses:\nâ\nEk gaan aan u ân\nstelling maak wat deur beskuldigde 1 in sy pleitverduideliking aan\nhierdie hof gemaak is. Dit is dat dit bekend\nis by ervare\npolisiebeamptes dat wanneer ân persoon gearresteer is, as jy ân\nlasbrief op hom kan kry en jy kan hom arresteer,\nis dit soveel\nmakliker met die ondervraging want hy is meer geneig dan om sy\nsamewerking te gee. Hy is uit sy omstandighede uit en\nmakliker vertel\nhy jou wat het gebeur. --- My ervaring is dat dit korrek is, u edele,\ngrotendeels vanweÃ« die blote feit dat die\nverdagte dan ervaar of\naanvaar dat daar\nprima\nfacie\ngetuienis teen hom moet bestaan aangesien ân aanklaer en ân\nlanddros nie ân lasbrief sal uitreik op spekulatiewe inligting\nnie.\nEk wil dit selfs ân\nstappie verder neem. Wanneer ân persoon ân verdagte is en daar is\nân lasbrief op ân ander saak teen\nhom, selfs daardie arrestasie\nop die ander saak waar die persoon dan in hegtenis geneem word, maak\ndaardie persoon baie meer vatbaar\nom saam te werk met die polisie. Hy\nis uit sy natuurlike omgewing. --- Dit is korrek, u edele, dit is ook\nondersoek taktiek wat veral\ngebruik word in die ondersoek van\ningewikkelde komplekse sake waar die bewys van die saak baie moeilik\nis.\nEk wil vir u sÃª wat\nhier gebeur het en dan u kommentaar vra daaroor, daar was ân\npersoon wat ons na verwys in die saak as Titus,\nTitus is een van die\npersone wat hier omkring was en dat u geglo het  hy is betrokke. Dit\nis Titus Seboka. Daar is vasgestel dat\ndaar op ân ander\naangeleentheid ân lasbrief teen hom is. Daar is besluit om hom op\ndaardie lasbrief te arresteer wat aan hulle\ndan die geleentheid sou\ngee om hierdie aanvaarde ondersoekmetode toe te pas en dan ook die\nondervraging te doen op die Putco saak.\n--- U edele, ek vra die hof\nom verskoning, ek wil net seker maak ek verstaan die stelling korrek.\nIs die stelling van u advokaat\nRoux dat ek oor daardie  inligting\nbeskik het? . . .\nWat ek eintliik wil weet\nin die lig van die erkende ondersoekmetode, wat ek wil weet met u\nervaring sou dit vir u ân sinvolle wyse\nvan optrede gewees het as\ndaar nou ân lasbrief teen een van die verdagtes uit is op ân\nander saak om daardie lasbrief uit te\nvoer, juis omdat ân persoon\ndan meer geneÃ« is om met die waarheid vorendag te kom in daardie\nomstandighede? --- Ja . . .  Sou\ndit vir u sinvol wees? --- Ja, u\nedele.â\n[38]\tA former high-ranking officer in\nthe SAPS, Mr Karel Johannes Britz, testified concerning this method.\nThe following are the relevant\npassages from his evidence in the\ncourt below:\nâ\nStep into that same\ntrap. Mnr Titus Seboka, dit was amper vir hulle\nbingo\ntoe hulle weet daar is ân lasbrief, want dit is ân ou\nondersoekmetode dat as jy ân persoon op ân lasbrief onverwant kan\narresteer\nen hy is weg uit sy warmte van sy omgewing, dan is hy baie\nmeer geneÃ« om saam met die polisie te werk en te vertel wat gaan\naan.\n--- U Edele, ja, u weet, die tipe ondersoeke wat ons gedoen het,\nas elke beskuldigde ân lasbrief teen hom gehad het, maar dan sou\nons duisende meer sake opgelos het. Maar ons het net 48 uur om ân\nou aan te hou sonder ân lasbrief en dan moet jy hom Ã³f aankla,\nÃ³f\nlaat loop. As ân man wat van moord beskuldig word op A ân\nlasbrief teen hom het vir ân huisbraak op Brits en ons weet dit\nvoor die tyd, dan vang ons hom op die huisbraak van Brits en ons hou\nhom aan en ons laat die borg opponeer en ons het ân lang tyd\nom hom\nte ondervra.\nInteendeel, in hierdie\nsaak doen hulle presies dieselfde. Hulle het vir Burger, en u weet\ndaarvan, op ân ander saak gearresteer\nmet die uitsluitlike doel om\nhom in hierdie saak te ondervra. --- En aan my getuie â¦[tussenbei]\nHulle was oop daaroor en\nhom vir 20 dae aangehou en hy was onskuldig bevind. --- En om hom as\ngetuie te maak teen hy en ân klomp\nander mense, dit is waar.\nJa. Saam met dit wil ek\nvir u sÃª dat die staat het getuienis aangebied dat mnr Seboka, Titus\nSeboka, wel by die werk was op 23 Mei\n2000, mar ek wil dit vir u in\nkonteks plaas met ondersoekmetodes. Ek wil dit aan u stel, u kan\ndaarop antwoord dat dit baie selde\nis dat die polisie ân persoon by\nsy werk sal gaan arresteer en daar is goeie redes daarvoor. Hulle is,\nhulle weet as hulle met\ndaardie onverwagse laatnag, 04:00 die oggend\nkom, is daardie persoon soveel meer onverwags betrap en soveel meer\nsamewerkend. ---\nU Edele, ja, ek sal vir u sÃª verskillende\nondersoekers verskil van mekaar. Ons ouens wat Moord en Roof\nagtergrond het en wat goed\nonderleg is in ondervragingsmetodes, dis\nhoekom ons op Moord en Roof is, het nie maklik ân ou by sy werk\ngaan vat waar almal sien,\nalmal vra vrae, alles nie. Ons het\nuitgevind, ons het vir hoeveel dae ân verdagte se huis dopgehou,\ndan sien ons hom in- en uitgaan,\nmaar ons besluit dis nie nou reg om\nhom te vang nie. Dan doen ons dit nie.\nEk dink ook een van die\nredes, en die polisie sÃª dit nie altyd graag nie, as hulle hom daar\nâ en on sweet van verdedigingskant\nâ as hulle hom by daardie werk\ngaan haal voor die polisie ry, is die advokaat of die prokureur daar.\n--- Hulle wag vir jou by die\naanklagkantoor, dis korrek.\nMaar nie by sy huis so\nmaklik 04:00 die oggend nie. --- Dis korrek. Die regsmense werk nie\nmaklik in die nag nie, hulle kom eers\ndie volgende oggend uit!â\n[39]\tSouth Africa is not a police\nstate. Section 36 of the Constitution is emphatic about the rights of\narrested, detained and accused\npersons. These rights are not to be\nflouted. The police methods described in the passages set out in the\npreceding paragraphs reflect\nan attitude reminiscent of the darker\ndays of South Africaâs history and has no place in our present\ndemocratic order. It should\nbe dealt with decisively by the relevant\nauthorities.\n[40]\tThe second issue concerns the\nundesirable fusion of private and police investigations. It appears\nfrom the evidence referred\nto earlier that AIN commanded the\nresources of the SAPS when it saw fit. The police officials involved\nreadily complied. The SAPS\nis not up for privatisation, nor for\ndirection by parties such as AIN. This too is a matter that should be\ndealt with by the relevant\nauthorities.\n[41]\tLastly, it is not only that the\nlines between the AIN and police investigations became blurred, but,\nas set out above, police\nofficials acted in two capacities, even\ngoing to the extent of doing AIN work whilst on police âsick\nleaveâ. This is untenable\nand should be investigated by the\nrelevant Ministry.\n[42]\tIn light of the conclusions set\nout earlier, the following order is made:\n1. \tThe appeal against both\nconvictions is upheld and the convictions and related sentences are\nset aside.\n2.\tThe cross-appeal by the State\nagainst sentence is dismissed.\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\nAppellant:\tJ G Cilliers SC\nInstructed\nby\nAdv\nJ Cilliers Brooklyn Advocates Chambers Pretoria\nTruter,\nCrous & Wiggill Inc c/o Naudes Attorneys Bfn\nFor\nRespondent:\tA J Fourie\nA\nP Wilsenach\nInstructed\nby\nDirector\nof Public Prosecutions Pretoria\nDirector\nof Public Prosecutions Bloemfontein\n1\nThe third appellant, Mr Jaochim Prinsloo, was a police reservist at\n\tthe time and was acting as such.\n2\nBoth the first and second appellants, in a written statement made on\n\t24 May 2000 under the guidance of their attorney, said the\n\tfollowing:\nâ\n3.\n\tOn the morning of 22 May 2000 I was contacted by Henry Beukes to\n\tassist him in an investigation concerning the theft of R1,2000\n\t000-00 at Putco.\n4.\n\tI was requested to approach Sandy Botomane and Titus to question\n\tthem about the said theft.â\nThis\n\tindicates a pre-planned interrogation of the deceased and Seboka and\n\tnot a spontaneous decision to seek his assistance to find\nSeboka,\n\tlending a lie to their evidence in court. In admissions made in\n\tterms of\nsection 220\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\nBeukes\n\tadmitted, inter alia, that he had, on the morning of 22 May 2000,\n\tinstructed two policemen to confirm the addresses of Seboka\nand the\n\tdeceased. It is clear from this that Beukes and subsequently the\n\tappellants had both Seboka and the deceased in their sights.\n3\nThe following appears in\nR\n\tv Blom\n:\nâ\nIn\n\treasoning by inference there are two cardinal rules of logic which\n\tcannot be ignored:\n(1)\n\tThe inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the\n\tproved facts.

    "facts": "In May 2000 a theft of R1.2 million from Putco, a bus company, prompted both the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the private investigator firm Associated Intelligence Network (AIN) to investigate. Several Putco employees, including the deceased Sandy Botomane and a man named Titus Seboka, were identified as possible suspects after polygraph tests. On 22–23 May 2000, three police officers – the appellants – were asked by Henry Beukes, who was simultaneously employed by SAPS and moon‑lighting for AIN, to locate Seboka. The officers went to Botomane’s home, identified themselves as police, and persuaded him to accompany them, claiming they were taking him to the Atteridgeville police station. Botomane was later found dead on the N1 highway near Vanderbijlpark, his body showing injuries that could have resulted from a hit‑and‑run or from being killed elsewhere and later placed on the road. The trial judge relied on the officers’ inconsistent testimonies, a diary entry, and the absence of an alibi to convict them of murder and kidnapping.",
    "issues": "The Court had to determine (1) whether the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers caused Botomane’s death, and (2) whether the conduct of the officers amounted to kidnapping, given that Botomane allegedly volunteered to accompany them. Ancillary issues concerned the admissibility of evidence obtained through questionable interrogation tactics and the propriety of police officers acting on behalf of a private investigator.",
    "principles": "The judgment applied the rules on circumstantial evidence articulated in R v Blom, requiring that (i) the inferred conclusion be consistent with all proved facts and (ii) no other reasonable inference be possible. The State must prove the corpus delicti and the accused’s culpable involvement beyond reasonable doubt. Kidnapping is defined as the intentional unlawful deprivation of liberty; a conviction cannot stand where the person voluntarily accompanies the accused. Section 36 of the Constitution guarantees rights of arrested and detained persons, which cannot be overridden by police tactics such as the “well‑known fact” that detainees are more likely to cooperate. Evidence obtained by improper or coercive methods is not permissible to fill gaps in the State’s case.",
    "application": "The Court found that the prosecution failed to exclude reasonable alternative explanations for Botomane’s death; the injuries were compatible with a hit‑and‑run and there was no forensic link between the officers and the fatal injury. The diary entry and contradictions in the officers’ testimonies undermined their credibility but did not, on their own, satisfy the stringent logical test for circumstantial inference. Regarding kidnapping, the Court noted that Botomane, after being told the officers were police, chose to go with them voluntarily and was never taken to a police station, meaning the essential element of unlawful deprivation of liberty was absent. Consequently, both convictions were unsustainable.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal against both the murder and kidnapping convictions was upheld; the convictions and the sentences imposed by the Pretoria High Court were set aside. The State’s cross‑appeal against the sentence was dismissed."
