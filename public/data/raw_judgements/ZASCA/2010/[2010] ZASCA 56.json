In addition to opposing\nthe\napplication for a winding-up order, the first appellant, Richard\nJames Smyth (Smyth) launched a counter-application for (inter alia)\nan order in terms of s 36 of the Act terminating Mew's membership of\nCoco Haven and an order that Mew's membership's interest in\nCoco\nHaven be acquired by Smyth against payment to Mew of R400 000\n(alternatively an amount to be determined by the court). The court\nbelow granted an order for the final liquidation of Coco Haven and\ndismissed Smyth's counter-application. The appellants are appealing\nagainst that judgment with the leave of this court. Since the\njudgment of the court below, Smyth has passed away and has been\nsubstituted\nby the executors of his estate.\n[2]\tCoco Haven is a close corporation trading under the\nname and style of The Corner House Pub (the pub) in Randburg,\nJohannesburg.\nSmyth and Mew are the only members of Coco Haven. Mew\nbecame involved in Coco Haven in September 2007 when he paid Smyth\nR200 000\nfor a 50% member's interest.\n[3]\tIn terms of an association agreement concluded by\nSmyth and Mew on 5 September 2007, the management of the business was\nvested\nin Smyth who was employed by Coco Haven in a full time\ncapacity earning a salary of R25 000 per month. Mew was a 'sleeping\npartner'\nand was to receive an amount of R5 000 per month, 'profits\npermitting'.\n[4]\tThe association agreement provided further that all\nmonthly accounting records were to be made available to the members\nfortnightly\nor upon request within a reasonable time. Furthermore,\nSmyth who was the managing member could not, save with the authority\nof a\nresolution of the members, incur any capital expenditure in\nexcess of an amount of R5 000.\n[5]\tMew complained that since the inception of the\nbusiness, Smyth refused to allow him, as a member of Coco Haven, to\ninspect its\naccounting records, source documents, bank statements,\nmanagement accounts or books of account. At the same time, Smyth was\nnot paying\nMew the R5 000 per month agreed upon. Smyth averred that\nthis amount was accruing to Mew's loan account. According to Mew,\nSmyth's\nexplanation for non-payment of this amount was that the\nbusiness was not making a profit, but was merely breaking even.\n[6]\tIn the course of all these developments, Mew\ndiscovered that Smyth had, without his consent, bought a double cab\nMazda Drifter\n4x4 motor vehicle for himself. It is common cause that\nthe monthly payments for this vehicle came from Coco Haven. These\npayments\nwere not debited to Smyth's loan account. According to Mew\nthe registered owner of this vehicle is Ms M du Plessis who is\nSmyth's\nfiancÃ©e. It is common cause that Smyth was busy with\nextensive structural alterations to the premises, without Mew's prior\napproval.\nThis was in contravention of clause 3.6 of the association\nagreement. According to Smyth the money expended on the alterations\nbetween\n1 March 2007 and 29 February 2008 amounted to R793 057.82,\nalthough Coco Haven's draft financial statements for the year ending\n29\nFebruary 2008 reflected the costs of these improvements to be R269\n703.\n[7]\tAccording to Mew, he met with Ms Nicolene Botes, who\nwas a night manager at Coco Haven. Botes made a number of disclosures\nto\nMew which were disturbing. Amongst others, she told Mew that Smyth\nconducted the close corporation's business through a bank account\nat\nFirst National Bank in the name of Smyth's daughter.  It is common\ncause that the bank account was in the name of Nicola Ann Prinsloo,\nt/a The Corner House. Ms Prinsloo is Smyth's daughter and she had\nsigning powers on this bank account. It transpired that the close\ncorporation had no bank account of its own, with the result that all\nthe money which the close corporation was banking was deposited\ninto\nPrinsloo's account. No reference was made in the bank statements\nrelating to this account to the close corporation's registration\nnumber and the statements indicate that the VAT registration number\nof the account holder is 'not available'. In fact, it subsequently\nemerged that the close corporation had failed to register for VAT,\nPAYE, UIF, SDL and WCA.\n[8]\tFrom other disclosures which Botes made to Mew it is\nclear that Smyth did not have a proper cash management system in\nplace. All\nthe cash takings for the day were put in a bag at the end\nof each business day and thrown through the window of the cottage on\nthe\npremises occupied by Smyth and Du Plessis. Both Smyth and Du\nPlessis had keys to the cottage and therefore had access to the\nmoney.\nSignificantly, Smyth confirmed this state of affairs.\n[9]\tSmyth admitted that he was not banking all the\ntakings from the business but was retaining large amounts of cash,\nallegedly to\npay the operating costs of the close corporation. This\nis notwithstanding the fact that, on Smyth's version, the business\nhad a turnover\nin the region of R750 000 per month. The time period\nreport for 1 April 2008 to 23 September 2008 shows that the business\ngenerated\nsales of R3 728 823.60.\n[10]\tMew made various unsuccessful attempts to gain\naccess to Coco Haven's financial records. He was forced to resort to\ncourt for\nan order to give him access to these financial records. The\napplication was vigorously opposed by Smyth. The refusal by Smyth to\nallow Mew access to Coco Haven's financial records increased the\ntension and acrimony between the two. As a result both Smyth and\nMew\nbecame embroiled in a number of abrasive legal skirmishes.\n[11]\tBefore Mew became a member of Coco Haven, Smyth had\nsigned a written agreement of lease on behalf of Coco Haven with Mr\nand Mrs\nStrachan (the Strachans) in respect of the premises where\nCoco Haven conducted its business. The lease was to endure from 1\nFebruary\n2006 to 31 January 2009. Smyth had the option to renew the\nlease on written notice of at least eight months before the expiry of\nthe lease, but failed do so timeously.\n[12]\tSmyth had agreed in terms of the agreement of lease\nto pay the rent, municipal charges including rates and taxes as well\nas charges\nlevied in respect of electricity and water consumed at the\nleased premises.\n[13]\tDuring February 2008, Mew concluded a written\nagreement of sale with the Strachans in respect of the premises where\nCoco Haven\nconducted its business. Subsequent to the agreement of\nsale, Mew was unable to take transfer of the property as it\ntranspired that\nSmyth had not been paying rates and taxes and charges\nfor water and electricity. According to Mew the arrears amounted to\nabout R120\n000. On being confronted, Smyth did not dispute that he\nowed such charges. All that he disputed was the amount.\n[14]\tSection 68(d) reads as follows:\n'A corporation may be wound up\nby a Court, if â\n. . . .\n(d)\tit appears on application to\nthe Court that it is just and equitable that the corporation be wound\nup.'\n[15]\tSection 36 of the Act reads as follows:\n'(1)\tOn application by any\nmember of a corporation a Court may on any of the following grounds\norder that any member shall cease to\nbe a member of the corporation:\n(a)\tSubject to the provisions of\nthe association agreement (if any), that the member is permanently\nincapable, because of unsound\nmind or any other reason, of performing\nhis or her part in the carrying on of the business of the\ncorporation;\n(b)\tthat the member has been\nguilty of such conduct as taking into account the nature of the\ncorporation's business, is likely to\nhave a prejudicial effect on the\ncarrying on of the business;\n(c)\tthat the member so conducts\nhimself or herself in matters relating to the corporation's business\nthat it is not reasonably practicable\nfor the other member or members\nto carry on the business of the corporation with him or her; or\n(d)\tthat circumstances have\narisen which render it just and equitable that such member should\ncease to be a member of the corporation:\nProvided that such application\nto a Court on any ground mentioned in paragraph\n(a)\nor\n(d)\nmay also be made by a\nmember in respect of whom the order shall apply.\n(2)\tA Court granting an order in\nterms of subsection (1) may make such further orders as it deems fit\nin regard to â\n(a)\tthe acquisition of the\nmember's interest concerned by the corporation or by members other\nthan the member concerned; or\n(b)\tthe amounts (if any) to be\npaid in respect of the member's interest concerned or the claims\nagainst the corporation of that member,\nthe manner and times of such\npayments and the persons to whom they shall be made; or\n(c)\tany other matter regarding\nthe cessation of membership which the Court deems fit.\n[16]\tIt was common cause that Mew and Smyth had serious\nirreconcilable differences and the relationship between them had\nbroken down\nirretrievably. Mew alleged that it was important that a\nliquidator be appointed so that (inter alia) a thorough investigation\nof\nCoco Haven's financial affairs could be conducted to determine its\nfinancial position.\n[17]\tSmyth agreed that the relationship between them had\nbroken down irretrievably, although he attributed this to Mew. He\naccused\nMew of conduct which was likely to have a prejudicial effect\non the carrying on of their business. He avered that by purchasing\nthe\nproperty on which the business is being conducted for himself,\nMew acted in breach of his fiduciary duty to Coco Haven. Smyth avered\nfurther that the apparent unwillingness on the part of Mew to renew\nthe lease in favour of Coco Haven was prejudicial to the continuation\nof their business. He accused Mew of acting mala fide\n.\nSmyth was unequivocal that, given the\nprevailing circumstances, there was no possibility that he and Mew\ncould continue to work together\nin future or to remain co-members in\nthe close corporation.\n[18]\tSmyth stated that it would be just and equitable if\nthe court were to make an order that Mew cease to be a member of Coco\nHaven\nand that he be allowed to take over his membership at R400 000\nor any other amount which the court might find to be reasonable. This\nassertion is based amongst others on the fact that he had\nsingle-handedly built the business from a struggling small business\nto\na lucrative one; that the business employed 42 people who would\nlose their jobs if Coco Haven were to be liquidated and lastly, that\nit was better to keep a thriving business than to have it liquidated.\n[19]\tSmyth relied on a valuation done by Coco Haven's\naccounting officer and auditor, Mr Haasbroek (Haasbroek), in an\namount of R400\n000 which he stated should be paid to Mew in return\nfor the latter's member's interest. It is common cause that in\ndetermining the\nvalue of the member's interest Haasbroek did not\nconsult Mew. His valuation was based exclusively on the information\nsupplied to\nhim by Smyth and Ms Woolmer, Coco Haven's bookkeeper.\nSmyth asserted that the valuation was acceptable as it was done in\nterms of\nclause 8 of the association agreement, signed by both\nparties.\n[20]\tHaving analysed the evidence the learned judge\nfound that there was indeed a complete breakdown of the working\nrelationship between\nSmyth and Mew. Relying on a dictum\nby Nepgen J from\nDe\nFranca v Exhaust Pro CC\n(\nDe\nFranca intervening\n)\n1997 (3) SA 878\n(SE) at\n891E, the learned judge found that indeed 'the breakdown in their\nrelationship is so complete that any confidence and trust\nthey may\nhave had in each other no longer exists'.\n[21]\tConcerning the issue whether to grant the\nwinding-up order in terms of s 68(d) of the Act or the compulsory\nbuy-out of Mew by\nSmyth in terms of       s 36 the learned judge,\nrelying on\nKanakia v Ritzshelf 1004 CC t/a\nPassage to India & another\n2003 (2) SA 39\n(D) at 48E-F, found that Smyth had to adduce evidence that the relief\nwhich he sought should be granted. However, having accepted,\nwithout\ndeciding, that Smyth had discharged the onus for the purposes of\nestablishing conduct falling within the purview of s 36(1)(b),\n(c)\nand (d), the learned judge found that Smyth had not adduced\nsufficient evidence to enable him to exercise  his discretion in\nSmyth's favour in terms of s 36(2) of the Act. The learned judge was\nnot content with the fact that Smyth relied solely on the valuation\nmade by Haasbroek. He found Haasbroek's valuation not to be reliable\nas it was based entirely on the information submitted to him\nby Smyth\nand Coco Haven's bookkeeper, Ms Woolmer.\n[22]\tThe learned judge found that Smyth had failed to\nadduce sufficient evidence to prove that it would be just and\nequitable for\nthe learned judge to exercise his discretion in his\nfavour and make an order in terms of s 36(1) that Mew cease to be a\nmember of\nCoco Haven and further, in terms of s 36(2), that Smyth\nacquire his interest upon payment of a particular amount. In the\nresult,\nthe learned judge dismissed the counter application and\ngranted a final winding-up order in terms of s 68(d) of the Act.\n[23]\tBefore us counsel for Smyth submitted that the\ncourt a quo had\nerred\nin refusing to grant the counter application. It was submitted that,\nas the parties had bound themselves in terms of clause\n8 of the\nassociation agreement to a particular method of calculating a\nmember's interest, the learned judge was wrong in refusing\nto accept\nthe valuation by Coco Haven's accounting officer and auditor,\nHaasbroek. Counsel argued that, even if Haasbroek's valuation\nis\nfound to be unreliable, the court was bound to accept it as the\nparties had agreed to be bound by it. It was submitted further\nthat,\nas Mew had failed to attack the valuation on any of the recognised\ngrounds, namely fraud, collusion, capriciousness or manifest\ninjustice, it was not open to the court to reject it.\n[24]\tIn the main, counsel for Mew argued that the\nevidence showed clearly that Smyth was guilty of serious financial\nmismanagement,\nin that (inter alia)\nhe\nincurred personal expenses amounting to R90 722,90 which were paid\nfor by Coco Haven and made unauthorised payments to his erstwhile\npartner for his membership interest in the amount of R500 458,08\nwhich was not allocated to Smyth's loan account. Further, that he\nincurred huge expenses in respect of improvements which were done to\nthe premises without a resolution as required by the association\nagreement. In conclusion, she submitted that as Smyth had failed to\nadduce sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that it was just\nand\nequitable to order a cessation of Mew's membership, as opposed to a\nwinding-up, the court below was correct in dismissing the\ncounter-application and ordering that Coco Haven be liquidated.\n[25]\tIt should be clear from the provisions of s 36(1)\nand (2), as quoted above, that the court retains a discretion,\nfirstly whether\nto grant an order for the cessation of a member's\ninterest in the corporation, and secondly as regards the disposition\nof such member's\ninterest and the terms and conditions under which\nsuch disposition should occur.\n[26\tCounsel's reliance on clause 8 of the association\nagreement is misplaced in that this clause simply does not provide\nfor a valuation\nof the business by Coco Haven's accounting officer\nand auditor in the event of a compulsory buy-out in terms of s 36 of\nthe Act.\nThe court was accordingly not bound by Haasbroek's\nvaluation. The court had to be placed in a position which would have\nenabled it\nto exercise its discretion and carry out its functions in\nterms of s 36(2) and, in particular, to decide what financial\nadjustments\nshould be made: see\nDe Franca\nat\n894F-G;\nGeany v Portion 117 Kalkheuwel\nProperties CC & another\n1988 (1) SA 622\n(T) at 631H-632A;\nKanakia\nat\n48E-F. Such discretion can only be exercised if there is sufficient\ninformation before the court to enable it to 'make such further\norders as it deems fit' in regard to the matters referred to in s\n36(2):\nDe Franca\nat\n896H;\nGearny at\n631H-I.\nThe member who makes the application in terms of s 36(1) must place\nthe necessary evidence before the court: see\nGearney\nat 631 H and\nKanakia\nat 48E-F.\n[28]\tI agree with the court below that Smyth failed to\ndo so. Based on the above, I have no doubt that the court below was\ncorrect\nin finding that, given the circumstances of this case, a\nwinding-up was not only just and equitable as required by s 68)(d) of\nthe\nAct but was inevitable.\n[29]\tIn the result I make the following order:\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n________________\nL O BOSIELO\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor appellant:\tJ F ROOS SC\nInstructed by:\nJ J S Manton Attorneys, Johannesburg\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nFor respondent:\tK Bailey SC\nInstructed by:\nTanya Brenner Attorney, Northcliff\nMcIntyre & Van Der Post, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "Bernard Darren Mew applied to the South Gauteng High Court for a winding‑up of Coco Haven 1325 CC (trading as The Corner House Pub) under s 68(d) of the Close Corporations Act. Richard James Smyth, the other member, filed a counter‑application under s 36 seeking an order that Mew cease to be a member and that his 50 % interest be acquired by Smyth for R400 000. The parties were the sole members of the close corporation. Their relationship broke down amid allegations of financial mismanagement, non‑payment of agreed monthly allowances, unauthorised use of corporation funds for personal expenses, failure to keep proper accounts, and failure to register for tax and statutory levies. The High Court dismissed Smyth’s counter‑application and ordered a final winding‑up of Coco Haven.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the appropriate remedy is a winding‑up order under s 68(d) or a compulsory buy‑out and cessation of membership under s 36 of the Close Corporations Act. 2. Whether Smyth had discharged the evidential burden required to obtain an order under s 36(1)(b), (c) and (d). 3. Whether the valuation of Mew’s interest in the corporation was reliable enough to support a s 36(2) order.",
    "principles": "The court must exercise discretion under s 68(d) when it is just and equitable to wind up a close corporation. Under s 36(1) the court may order a member to cease to be a member on grounds of incapacity, misconduct or other circumstances rendering it just and equitable. The applicant seeking relief under s 36 must adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy the court of the alleged conduct and to enable the court to make further orders under s 36(2). Precedent: De Franca v Exhaust Pro CC (breakdown of relationship), Kanakia v Ritzshelf (evidential burden and discretion), and related cases requiring reliable valuation evidence.",
    "application": "The appellate court accepted that the relationship between Smyth and Mew had irretrievably broken down. However, it held that Smyth failed to provide adequate evidence of Mew’s misconduct that would satisfy the criteria of s 36(1)(b)–(d). The valuation relied upon was prepared solely by the corporation’s accountant using information supplied by Smyth and was therefore unreliable. Consequently, Smyth did not meet the evidential threshold to allow the court to exercise its discretion under s 36(2) to order a buy‑out. The court therefore concluded that the only appropriate remedy was a winding‑up order under s 68(d).",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The winding‑up order of Coco Haven 1325 CC made by the High Court stands."
