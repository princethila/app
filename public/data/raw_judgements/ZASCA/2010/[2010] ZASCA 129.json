The offences are alleged\r\nto have been committed\nduring July 2004 when the appellant was\r\narrested at the Cape Town International Airport. Foreign currency\r\nfound in his possession\nwas attached in terms of\ns 20\nof the\nCriminal\nProcedure Act 51 of 1977\n. An application to have the currency\r\nreleased was dismissed by the Cape High Court. An appeal to the full\r\ncourt of that division\nwas unsuccessful.\n1\nAn appeal to the\r\nConstitutional Court also failed.\n2\n[2] After several postponements the\r\nappellant’s trial was set down for 9 June 2008 in the Regional\r\nCourt Bellville. The appellant\nhas not yet pleaded to the charges and\r\nindeed on 9 June 2008 he launched an urgent application for a\r\ndeclaratory order that the\nDirectorate of Special Operations (DSO)\r\n(known before the unit’s disbandment as the Scorpions) and one\r\nof its members, Inspector\nHaywood, had acted outside the legislative\r\nand operational mandate of the Scorpions by investigating the\r\noffences the appellant\nis alleged to have committed. Such offences,\r\nit is common cause, did not fall within the definition of serious and\r\norganised crime\nthe Scorpions were mandated to investigate and\r\ncombat. Such conduct, the appellant argued, was in conflict with the\r\nConstitution\nand invalid and should be declared to be such.\n[3] Needless to say, conduct cannot be\r\ndeclared to be invalid, but only the legal consequences of that\r\nconduct. During the hearing\nof the appeal the order the appellant\r\nsought was amended to read: ‘It is declared that the Second and\r\nFourth Respondents\nacted outside of the legislative and operational\r\nmandate of the DSO and the consequences of their conduct are\r\naccordingly unlawful,\ninconsistent with the Constitution and\r\ninvalid’.\n[4] A further declarator was sought in\r\nthe notice of motion that the charges brought against the appellant\r\nwere unlawful, unconstitutional\nand invalid. This relief was not\r\npersisted with.\n[5] The court below dismissed the\r\napplication on the ground that the issues raised by the appellant\r\nshould best be decided by the\ntrial court. It made no order as to\r\ncosts. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this court. The\r\nfirst and second respondents\n– the National Director of Public\r\nProsecutions and the Head of the DSO respectively – were\r\ngranted leave to cross-appeal\nagainst the costs order.\n[6] The Ministers of Safety and\r\nSecurity and of Justice and Constitutional Development were cited in\r\nthe proceedings in the court\nbelow but they played no active role and\r\nabided the decision of the court. Inspector Lionel Taylor, an\r\ninspector in the service\nof the South African Police Service, who was\r\nthe investigating officer responsible for the appellant’s case\r\ndocket, was also\ncited, and similarly abided the decision of the\r\ncourt. The application was opposed only by the first, second and\r\nfourth respondents,\nthe last-mentioned being Mr Phillipus Haywood,\r\nthe fourth – a senior special investigator of the DSO. He was\r\njoined in his\npersonal capacity because of his alleged transgression\r\nof the DSO’s mandate by investigating the appellant.\nTHE RELEVANT FACTS\n[7] The DSO was created by s 7 of the\r\nNational Prosecuting Authority Act 32 of 1998 ('the NPA Act') and\r\ncommenced operations in\n2001. It was created to deal with national\r\npriority crimes, in particular organised crime and other specified\r\nserious offences.\nIt was disbanded during 2009 after the amendment of\r\ns 7 of the NPA Act by\ns 3\nof the\nNational Prosecuting Authority\nAmendment Act 56 of 2008\n.\n[8] At the time that is relevant to\r\nthis appeal the appellant was under investigation by the DSO. The\r\ninvestigation was authorised\nin terms of\ns 28(1)\nprior to the\r\namendment referred to above. Various charges of fraud, theft and\r\ncontraventions of the Company Act were preferred\nagainst the\r\nappellant and others allegedly acting in concert with him.\n[9] Mr Haywood was the lead\r\ninvestigator in the DSO investigation. He received information on 7\r\nJuly 2004 that the appellant intended\nto take more than R 1 million\r\nin foreign currency out of South Africa on 11 July 2004.\n[10] After discussing the matter with\r\nhis superiors it was decided to inform the relevant law enforcement\r\nagencies; the Commercial\nCrime Unit of the SAPS, the SAPS Border Unit\r\nand SARS.\n[11] It is common cause that the\r\nconduct or the anticipated conduct of the appellant – if it\r\nconstituted an offence –\ndid not fall within the definition of\r\nserious and organised crime that the Scorpions were mandated to\r\ninvestigate. That notwithstanding,\nMr Haywood took an interest in the\r\nmatter and he travelled to the airport on 11 July 2004 in the company\r\nof Mr Louw of SARS. There\nhe learnt that the appellant had changed\r\nhis flight to 13 July 2004.\n[12] On that day Mr Haywood returned\r\nto the airport with another DSO member, Mr Koekemoer. There they met\r\nCaptain Koegelenberg and\nInspector Gululu of the Border Unit and Mr\r\nGuerreiro of Customs. Mr Haywood pointed the appellant out to the\r\nBorder Unit.\n[13] Mr Nico Maree of the SARS was\r\nrequested by Mr Guerreiro to assist by obtaining a customs\r\ndeclaration from the appellant. The\nappellant agreed to a search of\r\nhis luggage in which the foreign currency was discovered.\n[14] The matter was handed to the\r\nBorder Unit. Captain Koegelenberg and Inspector Gululu allowed the\r\nappellant to board the plane\nas they were uncertain which regulation\r\nof the Exchange Control Regulations the appellant might have\r\ntransgressed. Enquiries from\nthe Commercial Branch and from Mr\r\nHaywood elicited the information that regulation 3(1)(a) was\r\ncontravened. Inspector Gululu then\nhad the appellant removed from the\r\naircraft. He was arrested and the currency confiscated. The appellant\r\nwas handed over to the\nCommercial Branch.\n[15] The next morning Inspector Taylor\r\nwas assigned to investigate the matter and he interviewed the\r\nappellant on 14 July 2004.\nAt the subsequent bail application on the\r\nsame day, Adv Van Vuuren of the DSO appeared, duly authorised by a\r\nwritten delegation\nby the Director of Public Prosecutions; Western\r\nCape. Another member of the DSO, Adv Bunguzana, received a similar\r\ndelegation.\nInspector Taylor consulted with Adv Van Vuuren on the\r\nbail application and the bail amount. Mr Haywood was present at the\r\nbail\nhearing.\n[16] On 28 October 2004 the appellant\r\nwas arrested on the fraud charges that were being investigated by the\r\nDSO. According to Mr\nHaywood he approached Inspector Taylor with an\r\neye to a joinder of the fraud and exchange control charges, but met\r\nwith a negative\nresponse. Nonetheless, it is common cause that from\r\nthat date until the end of 2007 the matters were dealt with on the\r\nbasis that\nthe appellant would be tried in the High court on all the\r\ncharges.\n[17] According to the appellant, all\r\npostponements of the matter, of which there were several, were, with\r\none exception, attended\nto by members of the DSO. On 22 April 2005,\r\nAdv Bunguzana informed the court at one such postponement that the\r\ncase was investigated\nby the Scorpions after initially having been\r\nthe responsibility of the SAPS. Correspondence on behalf of the\r\nprosecution and the\ninvestigators was sent on the DSO letterhead. One\r\npotential witness to the exchange control charges, Ms Rohr, informed\r\nthe appellant\nthat Mr Haywood had told her that he was the\r\ninvestigating officer when he subpoenaed her.\n[18] As it turned out, the appellant\r\nwas arraigned for trial in the regional court. The trial was\r\npostponed when the present application\nwas launched and has still not\r\ncommenced.\nTHE ARGUMENT IN THE COURT A QUO\n[19] The appellant’s case is\r\nthat the entire investigation against him was conducted\r\nsurreptitiously by the DSO, using other\nagencies as puppets, and the\r\nprocess of identifying witnesses, collecting evidence and preparing\r\nthe prosecution was orchestrated\nby the department because of an\r\nimproper intention on the part of the DSO to persecute the appellant.\n[20] The appellant submitted that in\r\ndoing so the DSO – and in particular Mr Haywood – acted\r\noutside its statutory authority\nby becoming engaged in the case\r\nagainst him. It was submitted that the investigation was not and\r\ncould not be authorised in terms\nof s 28 of the NPA Act, which\r\nrestricted the DSO mandate to organised crime and other specified\r\noffences. Exchange control violations\nadmittedly did not resort under\r\nthe DSO. Mr Haywood and the other members of the DSO, so it was\r\nsubmitted, therefore acted unconstitutionally,\nirregularly and\r\nunlawfully by orchestrating the investigation against him.\n[21] The appellant argued that s\r\n172(1) of the Constitution obliged the court to issue a declaration\r\nthat the investigation conducted\nin the manner alleged was unlawful.\r\nThat section provides, amongst other things, that when deciding a\r\nconstitutional matter within\nits power, a court ’must declare\r\nthat any law or conduct that is inconsistent with the Constitution is\r\ninvalid to the extent\nof its inconsistency’. The appellant\r\nsought no consequent relief.\n[22] It was not entirely clear from\r\nthe appellant’s papers why a declaratory order was sought in\r\nvacuo, without any consequent\nrelief. In the course of argument\r\nbefore us, however, counsel for the appellant informed us quite\r\nfrankly that a declaratory order\nwould bind the trial court when it\r\nwas called upon to decide what evidence might be admitted.\n[23] The respondents denied any\r\nsuggestion that the DSO had played any part in the investigation\r\nagainst the appellant, other than\nto pass information of the possible\r\ncommission of an offence on to other law enforcement agencies. The\r\nDSO had co-operated with\nthe prosecution services while it was\r\nintended to prosecute all charges in one trial.\n[24] The respondents furthermore\r\nsubmitted that the issue raised by the appellant was one that ought\r\nnot to be decided piecemeal,\nbut that the trial court was the\r\nappropriate forum to deal with questions relating to the\r\nadmissibility of evidence, the authorisation\nof the public prosecutor\r\nto prefer the charges against the appellant and the appellant’s\r\nright to a fair trial.\n[25] The court a quo found in a\r\nmeticulous and closely reasoned judgment that the appellant had\r\nfailed to establish that the DSO\nhad driven the investigation against\r\nhim. It also held that the respondents’ version was neither so\r\nunreliable nor so far-fetched\nthat it would justify a referral to\r\noral evidence.\n[26] That notwithstanding, the court\r\nbelow considered the question whether the declaratory relief in terms\r\nof section 172(1) of\nthe Constitution should be granted in the event\r\nof its findings on the merits being incorrect. After a careful\r\nconsideration of\nrelevant authorities the court concluded that it had\r\nthe discretion to consider whether an order of this nature should be\r\nissued\nor not. Weighing the facts of the matter the learned judge\r\nconcluded that it would be inappropriate to decide the constitutional\n\nissue raised by the appellant, which should best be left to be\r\ndecided by the trial court. The application was therefore dismissed.\n\nNo costs order was made.\nTHE ARGUMENTS BEFORE US\n[27] The court below held against the\r\nappellant on the merits and found that the allegedly, unlawful and\r\nunconstitutional conduct\nof the DSO and Haywood had not been\r\nestablished. Although it would be difficult to fault the court below\r\non this finding, I will\nassume for present purposes that the\r\nappellant indeed made out a case that the DSO exceeded its statutory\r\nmandate and that its\nconduct was thus inconsistent with the\r\nConstitution. The question that remains is whether a court is obliged\r\nin the circumstances\nto issue a declaratory order, notwithstanding\r\nthat no consequent relief is claimed.\n[28] It was argued\r\non behalf of the appellant that s 172(1) of the Constitution allows\r\nno room for the exercise of a discretion\nonce conduct is found to be\r\nunconstitutional. But that argument does not find support in the\r\ndecided cases. On the contrary, the\nfollowing was said in\nIslamic\r\nUnity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority & others:\n3\n‘\nA\r\nCourt's power under s 172 of the Constitution is a unique remedy\r\ncreated by the Constitution. The section is the constitutional\nsource\r\nof the power to declare law or conduct that is inconsistent with the\r\nConstitution invalid. It provides that when a Court\ndecides a\r\nconstitutional matter, it\nmust\ndeclare\r\ninvalid any law or conduct inconsistent with the Constitution. It\r\ndoes not, however, expressly regulate the circumstances\nin which a\r\nCourt should decide a constitutional matter. As Didcott J stated in\nJ\r\nT Publishing (Pty) Ltd and Another v Minister of Safety and Security\r\nand Others:\n\"Section\r\n98(5) admittedly enjoins us to declare that a law is invalid once we\r\nhave found it to be inconsistent with the Constitution.\nBut the\r\nrequirement does not mean that we are compelled to determine the\r\nanterior issue of inconsistency when, owing to its wholly\nabstract,\r\nacademic or hypothetical nature should it have such in a given case,\r\nour going into it can produce no concrete or tangible\nresult, indeed\r\nnone whatsoever beyond the bare declaration.\"\n.\r\n. .\nIn\r\ndetermining when a Court should decide a constitutional matter, the\r\njurisprudence developed under s 19(1)(a)(iii) will have relevance,\nas\r\nDidcott J pointed out in the\nJ T Publishing\ncase. It is,\r\nhowever, also clear from that judgment that the constitutional\r\nsetting may well introduce considerations different\nfrom those that\r\nare relevant to the exercise of a Judge's discretion in terms of s\r\n19(1)(a)(iii).’\n[29] The\r\nappellant’s counsel relied for the proposition that a court\r\nbefore whom a constitutional issue is raised has no alternative\nbut\r\nto rule on the matter on\nDawood\r\n& Minister of Home Affairs & others,\n4\nand\nMatatiele\r\nMunicipality & others v President of the RSA & others (No\r\n2).\n5\nNeither decision\r\nsupports the argument. In both matters the court was faced with\r\nconstitutional issues that needed to be decided\nin the interests of\r\njustice.\n[30] The very\r\nwording of section 172 (1) imposes a duty upon a court that is\r\napproached to decide a matter said to be constitutional\nin nature to\r\nconsider whether an order should be granted or not: ‘\nWhen\ndeciding\r\na constitutional matter . . .’\n[31] In its context\r\nthe word ‘when’ means ‘in the, or any, case or\r\ncircumstances in which’ (The Shorter\nOxford English Dictionary\r\non Historical Principles Oxford University Press 1988 reprint p\r\n2534). A court faced with an unmeritorious\nforensic finesse, clothed\r\nin constitutional garb, designed to delay or avoid the necessity of\r\nhaving to plead in a criminal trial,\nor to pre-empt a consideration\r\nby the trial court of the admissibility of evidence in terms of s\r\n35(5) of the Constitution, has\na duty to refuse an order that would\r\nencourage preliminary litigation. In\nNational\r\nDirector of Public Prosecutions v King\n6\nHarms DP said:\n'Fairness\r\nis not a one-way street conferring an unlimited right on an accused\r\nto demand the most favourable possible treatment,\nbut also requires\r\nfairness to the public as represented by the State. This does not\r\nmean that the accused's right should be subordinated\nto the public's\r\ninterest in the protection and suppression of crime; however, the\r\npurpose of the fair trial provision is not to\nmake it impracticable\r\nto conduct a prosecution. The fair trial right does not mean a\r\npredilection for technical niceties and ingenious\nlegal stratagems,\r\nor to encourage preliminary litigation - a pervasive feature of white\r\ncollar crime cases in this country. To\nthe contrary: courts should\r\nwithin the confines of fairness actively discourage preliminary\r\nlitigation. Courts should further be\naware that persons facing\r\nserious charges - and especially minimum sentences - have little\r\ninclination to co-operate in a process\nthat may lead to their\r\nconviction and 'any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of\r\nexploitation to obstruct and delay'.\n7\nOne\r\ncan add the tendency of such accused, instead of confronting the\r\ncharge, of attacking the prosecution.’\nAnd in\nThint\r\n(Pty) Ltd v National Director of Public Prosecutions & others;\r\nZuma & another v National Director of Public Prosecutions\n&\r\nothers\n8\nLanga CJ said:\n‘\nI\r\nnevertheless do agree with the prosecution that this court should\r\ndiscourage preliminary litigation that appears to have no purpose\n\nother than to circumvent the application of s 35(5). Allowing such\r\nlitigation will often place prosecutors between a rock and a\nhard\r\nplace. They must, on the one hand, resist preliminary challenges to\r\ntheir investigations and to the institution of proceedings\nagainst\r\naccused persons; on the other hand, they are simultaneously obliged\r\nto ensure the prompt commencement of trials. Generally\ndisallowing\r\nsuch litigation would ensure that the trial court decides the\r\npertinent issues, which it is best placed to do, and\nwould ensure\r\nthat trials start sooner rather than later. There can be no absolute\r\nrule in this regard, however. The courts' doors\nshould never be\r\ncompletely closed to litigants.’\nIn\nKey\r\nv Attorney-General, Cape Provincial Division, & another\n9\nKriegler J\r\nemphasized that, if evidence is tendered to which the accused\r\nobjects, it is for the trial court to decide in the light\nof all the\r\ncircumstances of the case whether fairness requires the evidence to\r\nbe led or to be excluded.\n[32] The same\r\nconsiderations must apply in this case. It was well-established\r\nbefore the present constitutional era that a criminal\ntrial is not to\r\nbe conducted piecemeal, and that continues to apply today. An accused\r\nis not entitled to have the trial interrupted\n– or to have it\r\nnot even begin – so as to have alleged irregularities reviewed\r\nby another court in the course of the\ntrial. It is important to bear\r\nin mind that while the Constitution guarantees to an accused a fair\r\ntrial that does not mean that\nthe prosecution must satisfy the\r\naccused in advance that the trial will indeed be fair. It is the duty\r\nof the trial court to try\na charge, and to ensure that the trial is\r\nfair, and if it turns out that it was not, then any conviction that\r\nfollowed might be\nset aside. It might even turn out that the accused\r\nis acquitted, in which case the alleged irregularities will be\r\nirrelevant. Litigation\nof the kind that is before us falls squarely\r\ninto the category of preliminary litigation that ought to be avoided\r\nand discouraged.\nAs Davis J said in\nSapat\r\n& others v The Director: Directorate for Organised Crime and\r\nPublic Safety & others:\n10\n‘\nFor\r\nthese reasons, I find that the essential purpose of applicants'\r\nnotice of motion was directed to the constitutionality and hence\n\nadmissibility of certain evidence which has been extracted by way of\r\nblood, semen and other samples. I consider that these questions\n\nshould be determined by the trial court when appraised of the full\r\nfactual context within which this evidence is sought to be admitted.\n\nIn this way a correct balance between the right to due process and\r\nthe imperative of crime control can be struck.'\n[33] No grave injustice would result\r\nwere the issues raised by applicants to be determined by the trial\r\ncourt. It was said on behalf\nof the appellant that a regional court\r\nhas no jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues, but that is only\r\npartly correct. A\nregional court, as with any criminal court, has the\r\nduty to ensure that a trial is fair, and that duty necessarily\r\nrequires it\nto determine at times whether the accused’s\r\nconstitutional rights have been breached.\n[34] I have pointed out above that a\r\ncourt is not obliged to entertain a constitutional claim in a vacuum\r\nand thus declaratory relief\nis not there for the asking. At this\r\nstage the appellant asks for a declaration to be made in vacuo. No\r\ngood reason commends itself\nwhy a court should consider such a claim.\r\nThe court below was correct in dismissing the claim and the appeal\r\nmust fail.\nTHE CROSS-APPEAL\n[35] The trial court made no costs\r\norder in the light of what it regarded as serious constitutional\r\nissues that the appellant raised.\n[36] The first and second respondents\r\nsubmit that the application was vexatious and purely intended to\r\ndelay the criminal proceedings.\nFor this reason, it was submitted\r\nthat the costs of the proceedings a quo should be awarded to the\r\nrespondents.\n[37] Had this court sat as court of\r\nfirst instance, I would have been strongly minded to grant a costs\r\norder against the appellant.\nHowever, it cannot be said that the\r\ntrial court exercised its discretion not to award costs to the\r\nsuccessful respondents capriciously\nor injudiciously. There are no\r\nexceptional circumstances that might justify interference with the\r\norder.\n[38] The cross-appeal must therefore\r\nbe dismissed.\n[39] As the hearing of the\r\ncross-appeal only occupied a short period of the hearing of this\r\nappeal no costs order will be made in\nrespect thereof.\nTHE CONDONATION AND POSTPONEMENT\r\nAPPLICATION\n[40] While the appeal was pending, the\r\nappellant failed to adhere to the time limits laid down for the\r\nprosecution thereof. The\nrecord was filed late. The appellant\r\nlaunched an application for condonation of the late filing of the\r\nappeal and for a postponement\nthereof, but arranged an extension for\r\nthe filing of the record with the office of the Registrar of this\r\ncourt. The respondents\nopposed the application for condonation and\r\nthe application for a postponement.\n[41] The application for a\r\npostponement was not persisted with, nor was the opposition to the\r\napplication for condonation. The respondents\nare nonetheless entitled\r\nto the costs of those applications as neither was withdrawn and\r\nremained live issues until the matter\nwas called. The respondents are\r\nentitled to have this aspect disposed of in their favour.\n[42] The following orders are made:\n1. The appeal is dismissed with costs\r\nwhich include the costs of two counsel.\n2. The cross-appeal is dismissed.\n3.

    "facts": "The appellant, Gary Walter Van der Merwe, a businessman, was arrested at Cape Town International Airport in July 2004 after foreign currency in his possession was seized under the Exchange Control Regulations. He faced two criminal charges: contravention of the Exchange Control Regulations and defeat of the ends of justice. The investigation was conducted by the Directorate of Special Operations (DSO), formerly known as the Scorpions, which coordinated with the SAPS, SARS and Customs. The DSO’s lead investigator, Senior Special Investigator Phillipus Du Toit Haywood, travelled to the airport, identified the appellant to border officials and facilitated the seizure. Subsequent bail applications and further arrests linked the exchange‑control matter with unrelated fraud investigations. The appellant’s trial was repeatedly postponed, and on 9 June 2008 he lodged an urgent application for a declaratory order alleging that the DSO had acted outside its statutory mandate and that the conduct was unconstitutional, seeking to have the consequences of that conduct declared unlawful and invalid.",
    "issues": "The primary issues were (1) whether the DSO, in investigating the appellant’s exchange‑control offence, acted beyond the powers granted by section 28 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act and therefore engaged in conduct inconsistent with the Constitution; (2) whether, under section 172(1) of the Constitution, a court is obliged to issue a declaratory order once such unconstitutional conduct is found; and (3) whether the court should entertain a declaratory claim in a vacuum, given that it constitutes preliminary litigation that could delay the criminal trial.",
    "principles": "The judgment relied on the constitutional principle that section 172(1) gives courts the power to declare laws or conduct inconsistent with the Constitution invalid, but that the power is discretionary and not mandatory in every case. Precedent cited includes Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority, J.T. Publishing v Minister of Safety and Security, National Director of Public Prosecutions v King, and Thint (Pty) Ltd v NDPP, emphasizing that courts should not grant declaratory relief where it amounts to abstract, hypothetical litigation and may encourage pre‑trial challenges. The court also invoked the fairness principle, noting that criminal trials must not be fragmented and that preliminary litigation should be discouraged to protect the public interest in the efficient administration of justice.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that the appellant had not established that the DSO acted outside its statutory mandate. Even assuming a breach, the court held that section 172(1) does not compel a declaratory order where the claim is raised in a vacuum and serves only to postpone the substantive trial. The court therefore exercised its discretion to refuse the declaratory relief, dismissed the appellant’s application, and upheld the lower court’s decision that the issues should be resolved by the trial court. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, the cross‑appeal was dismissed, and the appellant was ordered to shoulder the costs of the condonation and postponement applications.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal with costs, including costs of two counsel, dismissed the cross‑appeal, and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the applications for condonation and postponement. No costs order was made against the respondents in the original application."
