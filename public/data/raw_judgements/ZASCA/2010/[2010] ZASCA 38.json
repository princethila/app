Albert also failed to\ndisclose that George was survived by three\nchildren from his marriage\nwith the appellantâs mother, Safira Mogale. These children were:\nthe appellant born on 7 April 1959,\nAudrey Mogale born on 17 February\n1953 and Merona Maledu born on 22 August 1955.\n[3]\tOn 18 June 1974 Albert\nexecuted a will in which he bequeathed the disputed property to the\nsecond and third respondents and two\nother persons (now deceased) in\nequal shares as sole and universal heirs. The appellant and his\nsisters, Audrey and Merona, are not\nmentioned in the will.\n[4]\tAlthough Albertâs alleged\nfraud took place on 25 June 1969 the appellantâs summons commencing\naction was only served on the\nfirst to third respondents between 9\nFebruary 2004 and 13 May 2004. The fourth respondent, was only served\non 20 July 2005.\n[5]\tOnly the first respondent\npleaded to the summons, the others elected to abide by the decision\nof the court. The first respondent\nfiled a special plea of\nprescription, in which he alleged that the appellantâs claim had\nbecome prescribed by lapse of time. He\ncontended that as the claim\nfell due on 15 June 1969, when the property was transferred to Albert\n(regard being had to the circumstance\nthat the appellant attained\nmajority on 7 April 1980), the running of prescription against the\nappellant had been delayed until 7\nApril 1981 under the provisions of\ns 13\nof the\nPrescription Act 68 of 1969\n. The first respondent\ncontended further that, as the summons was served more than three\nyears after 7 April 1981, the appellantâs\nclaim had become\nprescribed and accordingly fell to be dismissed with costs.\n[6]\tThe appellant replicated that\nhe could not have instituted action earlier because, until about 6\nAugust 2003, he had had no knowledge\nof âthe identity of the\ndefendants and the facts from which the debt aroseâ. He averred\nthat he only gained knowledge of âthe\nproper identityâ of the\ndefendants and facts giving rise to the cause of action on or about 6\nAugust 2003, after obtaining information\nfrom certain documents in\nthe national archives in Pretoria. The documents referred to are the\nfollowing:\nâ\na copy of the\n\tdecree of divorce between Safira Mogale and George Mogale;\nconfirmation that\n\tthe property in issue belonged to George Mogale;\ndocuments relating\n\tto the winding up of the estate of George Mogale;\na declaration by\n\tAlbert Mogale that he was the sole surviving male heir of George\n\tMogale.â\n[7]\tThe sole question for\ndecision at the trial was therefore whether the appellantâs claim\nhad become prescribed, given that the\nfraud which formed the basis of\nthe claim took place on 25 June 1969 and summons commencing action\nwas only served in February 2004.\nIt is not in dispute that because\nof the appellantâs minority at that stage, (he was only 10 years\nold in 1969) leaving aside the\nquestion of whether or not he knew of\nthe fraud, the completion of prescription was delayed by virtue of\nthe provisions of\ns 13\nof the\nPrescription Act. Section\n13 of the Act\nprovides:\nâ\n(1)\tIf â\n(a)\tthe creditor is\na minor . . .\nthe period of\nprescription shall not be completed before a year has elapsed after\nthe day referred to in paragraph (i).â\nIn the context of this case the\nâdayâ referred to in para (a)(i) is the day the appellant turned\n21, viz 7 April 1980. Thus, in\nterms of\ns 13(1)(a)\n, the completion of\nprescription against the appellant would have been deferred until 7\nApril 1981.\n[8]\tIn this context and for the\npurposes of considering the provisions of the\nPrescription Act, the\nappellant is the âcreditorâ and any obligation on the part of the\nestate of Albert to restore to its rightful owner, property\nwhich he\nfraudulently appropriated is a âdebtâ\n1\nas described in\ns 11(d)\nof that Act. In terms of the section the\nordinary period of prescription for the âdebtâ is three years\nfrom the date upon which\na debt becomes due. However, the matter is\nfurther complicated by\ns 12(3)\nwhich provides:\nâ\nA debt shall not\nbe deemed to be due until the creditor has knowledge of the identity\nof the debtor and of the facts from which the\ndebt arises: P\nrovided\nthat a creditor shall be deemed to have such knowledge if he could\nhave acquired it by exercising reasonable care.â\n(emphasis added)\n[9]\tIt is obviously difficult for\nthe first respondent to get past the appellantâs bald assertion\nthat he only obtained knowledge\nof the fraud on 6 August 2003 when he\nobtained documents from the national archives in Pretoria. It is a\nstatement that can only\nbe tested against the probabilities in the\nlight of the totality of the evidence presented at the trial. The\ntrial judge rejected\nthe appellantâs version that he did not know\nthat the farm belonged to his father, George, and that he only came\nto know about\nthis on 6 August 2003. The learned judge concluded that\nâ[i]n all probability the appellant and his sisters knew or were\ntold even\nbefore they became majors that their right (to the\nproperty) stemmed from the fact that the farm had belonged to their\nfather.â\nThe judge set out grounds for this conclusion. She said:\nâ\n1.\tEven before\nplaintiffâs birth George had been frequenting the farm. According\nto Ntlatseng, on the date of plaintiffâs birth\nGeorge had gone to\nthe farm in Rustenburg.\n2.\tAccording to\nMaureen, George used to visit them at their maternal grandfatherâs\nhome in Rustenburg. He came from the farm driving\nhis tractor;\n3.\tMaureen\napproached Hilda and pieces of corrugated iron and a table were\npointed out as the only remaining items from their home\nbelonging to\nthem. In my view the home referred to then was the one in which\nGeorge lived on the farm. In all probability, Maureen\nwent to see\nHilda, about the farm which belonged to her father.\n4.\tMaureen\naccompanied Hilda to see Hugh Parkes, the attorney. In my view, it is\nunlikely that she would have gone to Johannesburg,\nif not to\nestablish first hand, the reason why they could not inherit the farm.\nThe possibility is there that she was informed of\nAlbertâs Last\nWill and Testament.\n5.\tTheir uncle\nNnakgolo George undertook to ensure that they received what\nrightfully belonged to them to the exclusion of the other\ngrandchildren.\n6.\tIndependently\nthey reported Albertâs estate to the Master in Mmabatho. Hilda,\nAlbertâs surviving spouse or the other grandchildren\ndid not\nfeature.â\n[10]\tAlthough the above reasons\nare in themselves compelling, in my view, the real question for\ndecision in this appeal is whether\non a consideration of the totality\nof the available evidence, it can be said that the appellant could\nnot have acquired knowledge\nof the fraud on the part of Albert on 25\nJune 1969, âby exercising reasonable careâ, as required in the\nproviso to\ns 12(3)\nof the\nPrescription Act.\n[11\n]\tOne only has to look at his\nversion to come to the conclusion that he took no steps at all, let\nalone âreasonableâ steps, to\nenforce his claim in a manner\nenvisaged in\ns 12(3)\nof the\nPrescription Act. The\nappellant and his\nsisters, Audrey and Merona, knew all along that they were going to\ninherit the property, as Albertâs intestate\nheirs. The appellant\nsays he did not know that the property belonged to his late father,\nGeorge, nor was he aware that Albert had\nmade a will bequeathing the\nfarm to the second and third respondents and two other persons (now\ndeceased). Albert died in 1976. Understandably\nhe was too young then\nto do anything about the matter. But after graduating from medical\nschool in 1983 he could have taken steps\nto find out in whose name\nthe property was registered. Instead what did he do? After completing\nhis medical degree, he set up practice\nin Thaba Nchu in 1984 and\nlater went to practise in Bloemfontein in 1985. Subsequently he moved\nto Potchefstroom during 1986 and\nfinally settled in Springs during\n1987.\n[12]\tThe appellant testified that\nhe only started applying his mind to the property issue in 1986 and\n1987 when he returned to practise\nin Gauteng. In reply to a question\nin cross-examination he said it did not strike him as strange that\nafter 11 years the property,\nwhich was his entitlement, had not yet\nbeen transferred and remarked somewhat curiously:\nâ\nIt was not\nstrange for me at that point because at that point there was no\ndispute / I came back from my studies and I needed to inquire\nwho was\nthen taking care of the property.â\nIt is clear from the above remark\nthat claiming the property was the least of his priorities. He was\nmore concerned about who was\ntaking care of the farm because he had\nobtained information that there was a company that was carrying on\nmining operations on it\nand another person who had planted sunflowers\nthere. It is not clear from the record what those enquiries yielded.\n[13]\tTwo years later in 1989 the\nappellant and his sister Merona went to consult an attorney, Mr\nMakhambeni, to seek advice on how\nto deal with the âpeople that\nwere mining graniteâ on the farm and those âwho had planted\nsunflower for the tradingâ purposes.\nThere is no indication that\nthe appellant sought to instruct Makhambeni to enforce his\nentitlement to the farm. Makhambeni requested\nthem to obtain the\nmarriage certificate of their parents, confirming that they were born\nof George and their mother, Safira Mogale.\nThey were also asked to\nobtain copies of death certificates of George and Albert and some\nconfirmation that George was the son of\nAlbert.\n[14]\tMerona obtained the\nrequested documents from the Department of Home Affairs, Rustenburg,\nand when she returned to Makhambeniâs\noffice with them in 1990 she\ndiscovered that he had been struck off the roll of attorneys.\n[15]\tIn the meantime the\nappellant was having discussions with members of the family and the\npurpose and details of these meetings\nis far from clear from the\nrecord. Be that as it may, they culminated in the appellant meeting\none of his aunts, Ms Nthlaseng Mogale,\nfrom whom he went to âcheckâ\nwho was actually taking care of the farm. His aunt referred the\nappellant to her brother, George\nNagole Mogale, who was âthe one\nwho had been taking care of the farmâ. The appellant and his\nsister, Merona, went to visit the\ngentleman concerned and he assured\nthem that he would see to it that the farm was returned to them. It\nappears from the record that\nthis meeting took place around 1999.\nArrangements were then made for the appellant and his sisters to go\nto Tlhabane Magistratesâ\ncourt, presumably for the purpose of\nwinding up the estate of Albert who died in 1976. The appellantâs\nuncle, George Nagole Mogale,\nmost unfortunately died in 2001 before\nthe visit to the Tlhabane Magistrateâs court.\n[16]\tMerona ended up going to the\nmagistrate together with her and the appellantâs half brother,\nSipho Leketi. On 21 September 2001\nthey were issued with a letter of\nauthority which authorized them to take control of the assets of the\nestate of Albert. On 29 November\n2002 the said letter of authority\nwas withdrawn, when it was discovered that Albert had in fact died\ntestate and consequently the\nfirst respondent was appointed the\nexecutor of the estate of Albert.\n[17]\tThe appellant is not an\nordinary lay person. He is a medical practitioner, who qualified as\nsuch in 1983. He commenced his practice\nin 1984 and was certainly at\nthat stage in a position to engage an attorney to secure transfer of\nthe farm into his name. On his\nown version as early as 1978 there was\nnever any dispute as to whom the farm (the property) was to go to.\n[18]\tObtaining a deed of transfer\nfrom the Deeds Registry would have provided the appellant with the\nrequired minimum facts for the\ninstitution of a claim against the\nestate of his grandfather, Albert, much earlier than on 6 August\n2003. It seems to me that the\nadverse operation of\ns 12(3)\nis not\ndependent upon a creditorâs subjective evaluation of the presence\nor absence of âknowledgeâ or minimum facts sufficient\nfor the\ninstitution of a claim. In terms of\ns 12(3)\nof the\nPrescription Act\nthe\nâdeemed knowledgeâ imputed to the âcreditorâ requires the\napplication of an objective standard rather than a subjective one.\nIn\norder to determine whether the appellant exercised âreasonable\ncareâ his conduct must be tested by reference to the steps\nwhich a\nreasonable person in his or her position would have taken to acquire\nknowledge of the âfraudâ on the part of Albert.\n(See\nDrennan\nMaud & partners v Pennington Town Board\n.\n2\n)\nOn the application of that objective standard, it is clear that if\nthe appellant had exercised reasonable care he could have acquired\nknowledge of the fraud, long before the claim prescribed, and thus\nthe requisite minimum facts to enable him to institute his claim\ntimeously.\n[19]\tOn the evidence, it is clear\nthat the appellantâs failure to institute action timeously was not\ndue to his lack of or inability\nto obtain knowledge but rather to his\ndilatoriness as correctly found by Thlapi AJ. It took him 6 years\n(1981 â 1987) after his\nclaim had prescribed to begin to make\nenquiries. It seems that he was more concerned about establishing the\nidentity of the person\nwho was âtaking care of the farmâ so as to\ntake up the issue as to who was conducting mining operations on the\nproperty and who\nwere planting sunflowers. It then took him another 3\nyears (1987 â 1990) to consult an attorney for the first time. The\nappellant\nwas not indigent and had the means to instruct an attorney.\nThen some 14 years passed before the appellant made enquiries about\ndocuments,\nwhich were ultimately retrieved from the National\nArchives, Pretoria on 6 August 2003. In these circumstances it is\ndifficult to\ndisagree with the judge a quoâs finding that the\nappellantâs dilatory and nonchalant conduct was the key\ncontributory factor\nto his purported inability to obtain âknowledgeâ\ntimeously.\n[20]\tA further ground advanced by\nthe appellant for his contention that his claim has not prescribed is\nthat the fraud committed by\nhis grandfather, Albert, on 25 June 1969\nwas a continuing wrong. Mr Bokaba for the appellant, argued that for\nas long as the property\nremained registered in the name of Albert,\nthe claim remains alive. No authority was cited for the submission\nthat a claim based\non fraud does not become prescribed.\n[21]\tThe point is clearly without\nmerit. Fraud is an act of deceit which resulted in a single act of\ntransfer and registration which\nwas completed on 25 June 1969. It is\nthat single act which constitutes the appellantâs cause of action\nand does not amount to a\ncontinuing wrong. (cf\nBarnett\n& others v Minister of Land Affairs & others\n3\n)\n[22]\tIn the result and on either\nbasis the appellant fails. The following order is made:\nâ\nThe appeal is dismissed with\ncosts.â\n________________________\nK\nK Mthiyane\nJudge\nof Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT:\t\t\tT J B Bokaba SC\n(with him D C Mpofu)\nInstructed by Noko Inc,\nPretoria\nNaudes, Bloemfontein\nFIRST RESPONDENT:\t\tF J Erasmus\nInstructed by Rooth Wessels Motla\nConradie, Pretoria\nRosendorff Reitz Barry,\nBloemfontein\n1\nIn\nBarnett\n\t& others v Minister of Land Affairs & others\n2007 (6) SA 313\n(SCA) it was said at para 19: âThough the Act does\n\tnot define the term âdebt,â it has been held that, for purposes\n\tof the\nAct, the term has a wide and general meaning and that it\n\tincludes an obligation to do something or refrain from doing\n\tsomething.â\nAfter referring to other relevant authorities Brand JA\n\twent further to say there is no reason why the term âdebtâ would\n\tnot\ninclude âa claim for the enforcement of an ownerâs right to\n\tproperty.â He cited with approval\nEvins\n\tv Shield Insurance Co Ltd\n1979 (3) SA 1136\n(W) at 1141F-G where King J said: âThe word\n\tâdebtâ in the\nPrescription Act must\nbe given a wide and general\n\tmeaning denoting not only a debt sounding in money which is due, but\n\talso, for example, a debt for\nthe vindication of property.â\n2\n[1998] ZASCA 29\n;\n1998 (3) SA 200\n(SCA) at 209F-G.\n3\nAt 320I-321A.",

    "facts": "The appellant, Stanley Leketi, claimed that on 25 June 1969 his grandfather Albert Mogale fraudulently transferred immovable property (Nooitgedacht No. 287) into his own name by falsely representing himself as the sole male heir of George Mogale. The appellant alleged that the property originally belonged to his father, the late George Mogale, who died in 1966, and that Albert failed to disclose the existence of three children (the appellant and his sisters). Albert later executed a will in 1974 bequeathing the property to other persons, excluding the appellant and his sisters. The appellant only became aware of the details of the transfer in August 2003 after retrieving archival documents. He instituted proceedings in February 2004, more than three decades after the alleged fraud.",
    "issues": "The central issue was whether the appellant's claim was prescribed under the Prescription Act 68 of 1969. Specific questions included: (1) When did the cause of action become due, considering the appellant was a minor at the time of the fraud? (2) Whether the appellant could be deemed to have acquired knowledge of the fraud earlier by exercising reasonable care as required by s12(3) of the Act. (3) Whether the fraud constituted a continuing wrong that would postpone prescription.",
    "principles": "The Court applied s13 of the Prescription Act, which delays prescription for a minor until one year after attaining majority. It also applied s12(3), which imputes knowledge to a creditor if it could have been acquired by exercising reasonable care, using an objective standard. The Court reiterated that a \"debt\" under the Act includes a claim for vindication of property. It rejected the notion that fraud on a single act creates a continuing wrong, citing Barnett v Minister of Land Affairs. Relevant authorities on the definition of debt and reasonable care were also considered.",
    "application": "The Court held that, after the appellant turned 21 on 7 April 1980, prescription would have expired on 7 April 1981. The appellant could have discovered the fraud earlier by obtaining a deed of transfer and investigating the registration, steps a reasonable person in his position would have taken. Evidence showed the appellant delayed inquiries for many years, focusing on ancillary matters such as mining on the farm rather than securing his entitlement. Consequently, the Court found the appellant’s dilatory conduct prevented him from acquiring the requisite knowledge in time, and the claim was therefore prescribed. The argument that the fraud was a continuing wrong was dismissed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The court affirmed the lower court’s order upholding the special plea of prescription, finding that the appellant’s claim had prescribed."
