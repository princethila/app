Section 21A of the Supreme Court Act 59 of\n1959 provides that appeals\nagainst cost orders alone should be\nentertained only in exceptional circumstances. (See\nTrustees for the Time Being of the Biowatch Trust v Registrar,\nGenetic Resources & others\n;\n1\nPresident, Ordinary\nCourt Martial & others v Freedom of Expression Institute &\nothers\n.\n2\n)\nBut for prayer (a) of the order of the court a quo declaring r 38(1)\nof the Regulations in terms of the\nLocal Government: Municipal\nSystems Act 32 of 2000\ninvalid, we would have struck the appeal from\nthe roll.\n[2]\tThe litigation giving rise to\nthis appeal has its genesis in the second respondentâs council\nchamber which had to consider an\napplication by the first respondent,\nMr M S Yengwa, for the post of Municipal Manager. The post was\nadvertised during February 2007.\nIt was stated as a requirement that\nthe prospective applicant should have âa recognised B degree in\nPublic Administration, or relevant\nfieldsâ. This provision was in\nthe job description prescribed by r 38(1) of the Regulations.\n[3]\tAlthough the first respondent\ndid not have the Bachelorâs degree mentioned in r 38(1) the\nMunicipal Council resolved to appoint\nhim, despite the opposition by\nthe appellant, the Member of the KwaZulu-Natal Executive Council for\nLocal Government, Housing and\nTraditional Affairs, as they considered\nYengwa to be appropriately qualified to do the job.\n[4]\tThe third to the thirteenth\nrespondents, councillors of the second respondent, voted in favour of\nthe resolution appointing Mr\nYengwa despite the fact that the Town\nClerk, Mr Pienaar, had, prior to the vote being taken, drawn their\nattention to the provision\nof r 38(1) which required the Bachelorâs\ndegree qualification.\n[5]\tOn 22 May 2007 the appellant\nbrought an application in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court,\nPietermaritzburg on an urgent basis seeking\nan order declaring void\nand setting aside the resolution taken by the second respondent on 16\nApril 2007 to appoint Mr Yengwa as\nits Municipal Manager. The\nappellant also asked for an order that the third to thirteenth\nrespondents, namely those councillors of\nthe second respondent who\nsuccessfully voted in favour Mr Yengwaâs appointment, pay the costs\nof the application. In the alternative\nthe appellant asked that the\nsecond respondent pay such costs.\n[6]\tOn 25 May 2007, some three\ndays after the institution of the application, it was brought to the\nappellantâs attention, through\nthe second respondentâs notice of\nopposition, that Mr Yengwa, for personal reasons, could not and did\nnot accept his appointment\nand that the necessity for the main relief\nsought by appellant had accordingly fallen away. The notice also\nadvised that should the\napplication be withdrawn the second\nrespondent would not seek any costs associated with its opposition\nbut, if not, it would seek\nan order for the appellant to pay the\ncosts thereof. The notice also advised that as a matter of law and\nprinciple the second respondent\nopposed the costs order sought\nagainst the third to thirteenth respondents, its councillors.\n[7]\tBecause the second\nrespondent, in its opposition, placed in dispute the constitutional\nvalidity of r 38(1), on which the appellant\nrelied for its relief,\nthe fourteenth respondent, the Minister for Provincial and Local\nGovernment, was joined as a party. The respondents\nalso filed a\nNotice of Intention to seek an order in terms of s 172(1) of the\nConstitution declaring r 38(1) invalid and having it\nset aside. The\nfourteenth respondent elected to abide the decision of the court.\n[8]\tDespite the fact that there\nwas no longer a lis between the parties, Mr Yengwa having indicated\nthat he was not taking up the\npost, the appellant decided to press on\nwith its application and insisted on its costs being paid by the\nthird to thirteenth respondents,\nalternatively by the second\nrespondent.\n[9]\tThe matter came before Van\nHeerden AJ who, while accepting that the substratum of the\napplication had fallen away and that the\napplication had in essence\ndeveloped into a fight about costs, considered himself bound to\ndetermine what the âliveâ issues were\nâat the time the\napplication was launched, irrespective of whether someâ of those\nissues were at that stage only of academic\ninterest.\n[10]\tThere is no doubt that in\norder to decide the question of costs the learned judge would have\nbeen entitled to have regard to\nthe merits, but he appears to have\ngone further than that in the present matter: he ended up making an\norder declaring r 38(1) invalid\nand setting it aside, as if there was\nstill a live issue between the parties.\n[11]\tIn my view, once the\nsubstratum of the application had fallen away it was no longer\nnecessary to make an order declaring r 38(1)\nconstitutionally\ninvalid. The weight of authority is totally against deciding matters\nwhich have no practical effect on the parties.\nAs a matter of\njudicial policy constitutional issues are generally to be considered\nonly if and when it is necessary to do so (\nS\nv Dlamini\n;\nS\nv Dladla & others\n;\nS v Joubert\n;\nS v Schietekat\n;\n3\nUthukela District\nMunicipality & others v President of the RSA & others\n;\n4\nIndependent Electoral\nCommission v Langeberg Municipality\n.\n5\n)\nMr Pillemer for the respondents did submit â without any degree of\nconviction, it must be said â that the retention of the order\nmight\nbe of assistance to the second respondent and other similar councils,\nwho would know where they stand in relation to r 38(1),\nif the order\nwere to remain. Mr Stewart for the appellant joined issue, contending\nthat there was no uncertainty in the regulation.\nIn any event it is\nnot the function of this court to give advice but rather to hand down\ndecisions on matters which have a practical\neffect on the parties.\nThe doors of counsel and attorneys are open to those who seek advice\nand other similar services. In conclusion\nI consider that the order\nof invalidity should not have been made and falls to be set aside.\n[12]\tI turn to the question of\ncosts. In the court a quo the appellantâs application was dismissed\nwith costs. Although the appellant\nhad throughout persisted in asking\nthat the councillors should pay the costs of suit, on appeal he\nindicated that a costs order was\nno longer sought against them\npersonally. But he still asked that each party pay its own costs of\nthe application. Subsequently,\nhowever, during the hearing of the\nappeal Mr Stewart for the appellant received instructions to concede\nthat the councillors were\nentitled to their costs but in respect of\nthe second respondent, he submitted that both the appellant and the\nsecond respondent should\neach bear their own costs.\n[13]\tIn my view the appellantâs\nearlier insistence that the councillors should pay the costs was\nfutile and ill-conceived in the\nlight of the decision in\nSwartbooi\n& others v Brink & others\n6\nwhich laid down that councillors cannot be held personally liable for\ncosts incurred in the performance of their functions as councillors.\nThe appellant would also have been aware of the protection they enjoy\nunder\ns 28(1)(b)\nof the\nLocal Government: Municipal Structures Act\n117 of 1998\nfrom personal liability for the costs of legal\nproceedings. It is difficult to understand why the appellant pressed\non and insisted\non payment of costs in the light of the\nabovementioned authority on the point. He surely would have had\naccess to legal advice in\nthe matter. I do not see any reason why the\nappellant should not be ordered to pay the costs of the councillors\neven though the appeal\nis decided substantially in his favour.\n[14]\tAs to the second respondent\nand the appellant one is confronted with a head-to-head contest\nbetween two state entities; the costs\npayable by both are drawn from\nthe public purse. In such a case the court has cautioned that organs\nof state must âavoid legal\nproceedings against one anotherâ and\nmust make every reasonable effort to resolve inter governmental\ndisputes before having recourse\nto the courts. (See the\nUthukela\ncase supra.\n7\n)\nFor that reason it seems that a fair decision would be that each\nparty pay its own costs. In my view, however, such an order would\nnot\nbe appropriate. There is a need for the court to show its disapproval\nof the conduct of the appellant in brazenly embarking on\na futile\nmission, when the lis between him and the second respondent had\nfallen away. This information was conveyed to him three\ndays after\nthe application had been launched. The appellantâs obduracy led to\nconsiderable costs being incurred. There is no reason\nwhy this court\nshould not depart from the normal rule, and by way of marking its\ndisapproval of the appellantâs conduct, make an\norder that he\nshould pay the second respondentâs costs. Accordingly, that order\nwill issue.\n[15]\tIn the result the appeal\nsucceeds partially and the following order is made:\n1\tThe order of the court a quo\ndeclaring invalid r 38(1) of the Regulations Published in terms of\nthe\nLocal Government Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000\nis set aside.\n2\tThe appellant is ordered to pay\nthe costs of the second to thirteenth respondents.\n___________________\nK K\nMthiyane\nJudge of\nAppeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT:\tA M Stewart SC (with\nhim T S I Mthembu)\nInstructed by PKX Attorneys,\nPietermaritzburg\nMcIntyre & Van der Post,\nBloemfontein\nSECOND TO THIRTEENTH\nRESPONDENTS:\t\t\t\tM Pillemer SC\nInstructed by Kathy James\nAttorneys, Mayville\nHoney Attorneys, Bloemfontein\nFOURTEENTH RESPONDENT:\nInstructed by State Attorney,\nKwaZulu-Natal\nState Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\n2009\n\t(6) SA 232\n(CC);\n[2009] ZACC 14\npara 11.\n2\n[1999] ZACC 10\n;\n1999 (4) SA 682\n(CC) para 13.\n3\n[1999] ZACC 8\n;\n1999 (4) SA 623\n(CC) para 27.\n4\n[2002] ZACC 11\n;\n2003 (1) SA 678\n(CC) paras 11-17.\n5\n[2001] ZACC 23\n;\n2001 (3) SA 925\n(CC) paras 9-14.\n6\n2006 (1) SA 203\n(CC) paras 17-23.\n7\nPara 13.",

    "facts": "The KwaZulu‑Natal MEC for Local Government applied to the High Court to set aside a council resolution that appointed Mr M S Yengwa as Municipal Manager of Umvoti Municipality, despite the fact that the job description required a recognised B degree in Public Administration under regulation 38(1) of the Municipal Systems Act. The council voted for the appointment against the MEC’s objection. Three days after the application, Yengwa withdrew, removing the substantive dispute. The MEC nevertheless persisted, seeking costs from the councillors who voted for the appointment and, alternatively, from the municipality. The High Court declared regulation 38(1) invalid and awarded costs, a decision appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the High Court’s order declaring regulation 38(1) invalid should stand when the underlying dispute had disappeared. 2) Whether the councillors who voted for the appointment can be held personally liable for the costs of the MEC’s litigation, in light of the Swartbooi precedent and section 28(1)(b) of the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act 117 of 1998. 3) How costs should be allocated between the MEC (appellant) and the municipality and councillors (respondents).",
    "principles": "The court reiterated that appeals against cost orders are only entertained in exceptional circumstances (s 21A Supreme Court Act). Councillors are protected from personal liability for costs incurred in the performance of their official duties (Swartbooi & others v Brink & others; s 28(1)(b) LGC Act). Constitutional issues should be decided only when necessary for the resolution of the case. State entities should avoid litigating against each other and, where disputes arise, each should bear its own costs unless conduct warrants a departure from the ordinary rule.",
    "application": "The court found that once Yengwa withdrew, there was no live controversy requiring a declaration of invalidity of regulation 38(1); consequently, the order should be set aside. Regarding costs, the appellant’s insistence on holding the councillors personally liable was deemed unfounded in view of the Swartbooi rule and statutory protection. While the usual rule would be that each party bears its own costs, the court ordered the MEC to pay the costs of the second to thirteenth respondents to signal disapproval of the MEC’s pursuit of a futile claim after the dispute had collapsed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was partially successful. The Supreme Court of Appeal set aside the High Court’s order declaring regulation 38(1) invalid. The MEC (appellant) was ordered to pay the costs of the second to thirteenth respondents (the municipality and its councillors)."
