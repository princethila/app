The issue in the\r\ncourt below was the validity or otherwise\nof the decision to award\r\nthe remainder of the contract to Tansnet Bus Service (Pty) Ltd.\n[2] Prior to October 2003, first\r\nand third appellants provided a bus service to the public of the\r\ngreater Durban and surrounding\nareas, as they were obliged to do, the\r\nthird appellant having been responsible, in terms of s 9 of the\r\nNational Land Transport\nTransition Act 22 of 2000 (‘Transport\r\nTransition Act’), for overseeing land public transport within\r\nthe province of\nKwaZulu-Natal. However, earlier in the same year, the\r\nfirst and third appellants decided to outsource public land transport\r\nin\nthe greater Durban and surrounding areas. Tenders for the\r\nprovision of the service were invited in terms of s 47(2) of the\r\nTransport\nTransition Act.\n[3] Consequent upon the tender\r\nprocess and on or about 30 September 2003, the first and third\r\nappellants concluded a contract with\nRemant/Alton Land Transport\r\n(Pty) Limited (‘Remant’) for the provision of public\r\npassenger bus transport services in\nthe greater area of Durban as\r\nfrom 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2010. The service was intended to\r\nprovide transport for about\nten thousand commuters daily.\n[4] During March 2009, the Metro\r\nGroup of companies (which incorporates the first, second and third\r\nrespondents as well as KZT Bus\nServices (Pty) Ltd) represented by\r\ntheir general manager, Mr Vikesh Maharaj (‘Maharaj’),\r\nreacted to newspaper reports\nand rumours of Remant’s impending\r\ntermination of the contract. Maharaj then addressed various letters\r\nto the first and third\nappellants in which he explained the\r\ncapabilities of the companies he represented to provide the necessary\r\nbus services, which\nwere being provided by Remant.\n[5] On 17 March 2009,\r\nrepresentatives of the first and third appellants convened a meeting\r\nwith the bus operators of the greater\narea of Durban, to discuss how\r\none or more of them could assist in providing bus services in areas\r\nwhere Remant was unable to do\nso. The meeting ended with the bus\r\noperators being invited to submit proposals to the offices of the\r\nthird appellant indicating\ntheir capacity to accommodate Remant’s\r\ncommuters on short notice, in areas where Remant was unable to\r\nprovide the service.\n[6] On 1 June 2009 Remant gave\r\nwritten notice to the first appellant of its intention to terminate\r\nthe contract on 30 June 2009.\nThe termination was accepted and Remant\r\nwas requested to source an alternate operator as provided for in\r\nterms of the contract.\nOn 17 June 2009 Remant informed the first\r\nappellant that it was unable to find an alternate operator and that\r\nthe agreement would\nstill be terminated with effect from 30 June\r\n2009.\n[7] It is common cause that by 6\r\nJuly 2009 the third appellant had decided to appoint the eighth\r\nrespondent as an alternate operator\nuntil 30 September 2010, being\r\nthe remainder of the period that the contract with Remant was\r\nscheduled to run. It is also common\ncause that no tenders were\r\ninvited for the appointment of a bus operator to provide the bus\r\nservices for the remainder of the period\nof the contract.\n[8] On 16 July\r\n2009, the first to sixth respondents launched an urgent application\r\nin the Pietermaritzburg High Court seeking an\norder, firstly,\r\ninterdicting the appellants and the eighth and ninth respondents from\r\nimplementing the award of the contract and\nsecondly, reviewing and\r\nsetting aside the decision of the first and third appellants to award\r\nthe contract to the eighth respondent\non the basis of non-compliance\r\nwith the provisions of subsections 47(1) and (2) of the Transport\r\nTransition Act,\n2\nwhich read as\r\nfollows:\n‘\n47\r\nSubsidised service contracts\n(1) After the expiry\r\nof any interim contract or current tendered contract or any extention\r\nthereof, whether provided for in such\ncontract or negotiated, if the\r\npublic transport service that had been operated in terms thereof will\r\ncontinue to be subsidised,\nthat service must be operated in terms of\r\na subsidised service contract.\n(2) Only a\r\nprovincial department, a transport authority and a metropolitan\r\nmunicipality may enter into a subsidised service contract\nwith a\r\npublic transport operator, and subject to subsection (3), only if ─\n(a) the service to\r\nbe operated in terms thereof, has been put out to public tendering in\r\naccordance with a procedure prescribed\nby or in terms of a law of the\r\nprovince;\n(b) the tender has\r\nbeen awarded by the tender authority, in accordance with that\r\nprocedure, and\n(c) the contract is\r\nentered into with the successful tenderer.\n(3) . . .’\nTo justify their failure to put\r\nthe service out tender, the respondents relied on certain provisions\r\nin the contract which allowed\nfor the appointment of an alternate\r\noperator, by either party. The application was successful and the\r\ndecision to award the remainder\nof the contract to the eighth\r\nrespondent was set aside.\n[9] By the time the appeal was\r\nheard on 15 November 2010, the contract in question had run its full\r\ncourse ─ to 30 September\n2010. In his heads of argument,\r\ncounsel for the respondents submitted that the issue of the validity\r\nof the agreement had become\nmoot, that a decision on the merits of\r\nthe appeal will have no practical effect and the appeal should\r\ntherefore be dismissed on\nthat ground alone, in terms of s 21A of Act\r\n59 of 1959) (‘the Act’). Counsel were accordingly invited\r\nto first address\nus on the question of mootness.\n[10] Section 21A(1) of the Act\r\nreads:\n‘\n(1)\r\nWhen at the hearing of any civil appeal to the Appellate Division\r\n[Supreme Court of Appeal] or any Provincial or Local Division\nof the\r\nSupreme Court [High Court] the issues are of such a nature that the\r\njudgment or order sought will have no practical effect\nor result, the\r\nappeal may be dismissed on this ground alone.’\n[11] Where the relief sought on\r\nappeal is moot and would be of academic interest only, the merits of\r\nthe appeal will not be entertained\nand the appeal will be dismissed\r\non that ground alone. (See\nPort Elizabeth Municipality v Smit\n2002 (4) SA 241\n(SCA);\nRadio Pretoria v Chairman, Independent\r\nCommunications Authority of South Africa & another\n2005 (1)\r\nSA 47\n(SCA)).\n[12] Counsel for the third\r\nappellant contended on behalf of all the appellants that the appeal\r\nwas not moot because the question\nof the validity of the contract is\r\na live issue and could have the following consequences viz (a) the\r\nappellants may be sued for\ndamages by the respondents; (b) there may\r\nbe outstanding amounts due to the eighth respondent for services\r\nrendered in terms of\nthe contract, and (c) the matter of subsidies\r\nmight have to be assessed.\n[13] Section 21A however confers\r\na discretion on this court to deal with the merits of the appeal.\r\nThis would be done where an appeal\ninvolves a question of law and\r\nwhich is likely to arise again. (See\nLand &\r\nLandbouontwikkelingsbank van Suid-Afrika v Conradie\n2005 (4) SA\r\n506\n(SCA).\n[14] It is clear that the\r\ncontract in question no longer exists and its validity or otherwise\r\nis therefore no longer a live issue.\nConsequently, deciding that\r\nissue will have no practical effect or result.\n[15] The factors raised on behalf\r\nof the appellants are all speculative. There is no evidence that\r\nsimilar matters, based on similar\nfacts, will arise in future. As was\r\nsaid in\nRadio Pretoria\npara 41:\n‘\n.\r\n. . Courts of appeal often have to deal with congested court rolls.\r\nThey do not give advice gratuitously. They decide real disputes\nand\r\ndo not speculate or theorise . . .’.\n[16] In any event the Transport\r\nTransition Act has since been repealed and the wording of the\r\nequivalent section in the\nNational Land Transport Act 5 of 2009\nis\r\ndifferent. Consequently there is no likelihood of the circumstances\r\nin this case being repeated.\n[17] In\nNational Coalition for\r\nGay and Lesbian Equality & others v Minister of Home Affairs &\r\nothers\n2000 (2) SA 1\n(CC), Ackermann J in referring to\nJT\r\nPublishing (Pty) Ltd & another v Minister of Safety and Security\r\n& others\n[1996] ZACC 23\n;\n1997 (3) SA 514\n(CC) said at para 21 (footnote 18):\n‘\nA\r\ncase is moot and therefore not justiciable if it no longer presents\r\nan existing or live controversy which should exist if the\nCourt is to\r\navoid giving advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.’\n[18] Clearly the matter is moot\r\nand there is no factual basis for the exercise of the discretion to\r\nentertain the appeal. The appeal\ntherefore falls to be dismissed.\n[19] The appeal is dismissed with\r\ncosts.\n___________________\nR Pillay\nActing\r\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFIRST APPELLANT: ABG Choudree\nInstructed by Linda Mazibuko and\r\nAss, Durban\nMatsepes Inc, Bloemfontein\nTHIRD APPELLANT: DJ Shaw SC (with\r\nhim R Padayachee)\nInstructed by Ngcobo Poyo\r\nDiedricks Inc, Pietermaritzburg\nBezuidenhouts Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nST\nto 6\nTH\nRESPONDENTS: RAK Vahed SC\nInstructed by Livingston Leandy\r\nInc, Durban\nMcIntyre & van der Post,\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nThird\r\n\tappellant is the member of the executive council for the portfolio\r\n\tof Transport in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal and consequently\nthe\r\n\tpolitical head of the department.\n2\nThe\nNational Land Transport Transition Act 22 of 2000\nwas repealed and\r\n\treplaced by the\nNational Land Transport Act 5 of 2009\n.",

    "facts": "The first and third appellants were responsible for public land‑transport in greater Durban. In 2003 they outsourced the service via a tender under s 47(2) of the Transport Transition Act and entered a contract with Remant/Alton Land Transport (Pty) Ltd covering 1 Oct 2003 to 30 Sep 2010. In March 2009 Remant indicated it might terminate the contract. Remant gave formal notice on 1 June 2009 and terminated on 30 June 2009. The appellants then appointed Tansnat Bus Service (Pty) Ltd as an alternate operator for the remaining fifteen months without conducting a new tender. The respondents filed an urgent application seeking an interdict and a review, arguing non‑compliance with subsections 47(1) and (2) of the Transport Transition Act. The High Court set aside the award to Tansnat. By the time of appeal the original contract had already expired on 30 Sep 2010.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the appointment of Tansnat Bus Service (Pty) Ltd as an alternate operator without a public tender complied with the requirements of s 47(1) and (2) of the Transport Transition Act. 2) Whether the appeal was moot under s 21A of the Supreme Court Act because the contract in dispute had already terminated and any decision would have no practical effect.",
    "principles": "The court applied s 47 of the Transport Transition Act, which requires that subsidised public‑transport services be awarded only after public tendering and that only a provincial department, transport authority or metropolitan municipality may enter such contracts. It also relied on s 21A(1) of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959, which allows dismissal of an appeal where the sought order would have no practical effect. The court cited precedent on mootness, including Port Elizabeth Municipality v Smit, Radio Pretoria v Chairman, and National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs, emphasizing that courts must avoid advisory opinions on abstract or dead controversies.",
    "application": "The court observed that the specific contract had fully expired, rendering the question of its validity a non‑live issue. No evidence suggested that similar circumstances were likely to recur, especially since the Transport Transition Act had been repealed and replaced by the National Land Transport Act 5 of 2009, which contains different provisions. Consequently, ruling on the validity of the award would have no practical effect. The speculative consequences argued by the appellants (potential damages, outstanding payments, subsidy assessments) were deemed insufficient to sustain a non‑moot appeal.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Court held that the matter was moot and there was no factual or legal basis to entertain the appeal."
