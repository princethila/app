He instituted\naction against the appellant, Mr P P Maree, in the Kroonstad\nMagistratesâ Court, for\npayment of an amount of R47 638.27, being\ncommission he alleged would have been paid to him over a period of\ntime had the latter\nnot cancelled an insurance policy procured on his\nbehalf. The claim was based on a written agreement between them, the\nprovisions\nof which will be dealt with in due course.\n[2]\tMr Maree opposed the action and in\na counterclaim sought a statement and debatement of account. The\nMagistratesâ Court dismissed\nMr Booysenâs claim with costs, on\nthe basis that the written agreement on which the claim was based\ncontravened s 49 of the Long-term\nInsurance Act 52 of 1998 (the Act),\nread with the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Magistrate\ngranted Mr Mareeâs counterclaim.\nThe applicable statutory\nprovisions will be examined later.\n[3]\tMr Booysen appealed the\nMagistratesâ court decision to the Free State High Court in\nBloemfontein, which (Kruger J, Mocumie J\nconcurring) upheld the\nappeal with costs, substituting the Magistrateâs order as follows:\nâ\n1.Verweerder word\ngelas om eiser R47 738, 27 te betaal plus rente teen 15, 5% per jaar\nvanaf 4 April 2006 tot op datum van finale\nvereffening.\n2. Verweerder se teeneis\nword met koste van die hand gewys.â\n[4]\tIt is against that decision and\norder that Mr Maree appeals, with the leave of the court below. The\nbackground facts are largely\nuncontested and are set out hereafter.\n[5]\tMr Booysen had rendered advisory\nservices to Mr Maree, a successful businessman, for approximately 20\nyears. The seeds of the\npresent antagonism between them were sown\nwhen, during July 2006, Mr Booysen advised Mr Maree to have a\ncurrent Sanlam annuity\npolicy âpaid upâ\n1\nand to replace it with a Momentum Life policy. Mr Maree\ninitially proceeded to follow that advice.\n[6]\tOn 17 July 2006, Sanlam, as it was\nstatutorily obliged to, sent Mr Maree a document in which it set out\nthe impact of causing\nthe policy to be âpaid upâ. It appears\nthat, following on a further discussion with another Insurance\nadvisor based at a local\nbank, Mr Maree came to the conclusion\nthat he had been wrongly advised by Mr Booysen and that the\nlatter had been motivated\nby the commission to be earned on the\nMomentum Life policy. This, of course, is denied by Mr Booysen, who\ntestified that the advice\nhe gave was based on the fact that\ncontinued premiums on the Sanlam policy was not tax-effective for Mr\nMaree and that, in the long\nterm the former would earn less in\ncommission on the new policy. For reasons that will become apparent\nit is not necessary to resolve\nthis subsidiary dispute.\n[7]\tOn 21 July 2006 in a very curt\nletter to Mr Booysen, Mr Maree wrote the following:\nâ\nHiermee stel ons u in\nkennis dat M.C. Ingenieurswerke BK\n2\nen P.P. Maree, nie meer van N V M Beleggings & versekerings\nadviseurs se dienste gebruik sal maak nie.\nOns wil nie redes verskaf\nnie en versoek dat u dit so sal respekteer. Ons kan u verseker dat\ndie besluit nie ligweg geneem is nie\nen dit sal nie heroorweeg word\nnie.â\n[8]\tOn 25 July 2006 Mr Maree wrote to\nMomentum Life cancelling the policy that Mr Booysen had procured on\nhis behalf.\n[9]\tOn 31 August 2006, Mr Maree wrote\na further letter to Mr Booysen, stating that he had decided to\nreplace him with ABSA brokers.\nThe following are the relevant parts\nof Mr Mareeâs letter:\nâ\nMy besluit om ABSA\nMakelaars (Neels Greeff) as my nuwe makelaar aan te stel is my keuse\nwat ek hoop jy sal respekteer.\nEk het slegs ân tweede\nopinie ingewin nadat ek ân skrywe vanaf Sanlam, waarvan die opskrif\nas volg was: âImpak om ân polis\nvolopbetaald te maakâ ontvang\nhet.\nNadat ek ân tweede,\nderde en vierde opinie ingewin het, het ek besluit om by Sanlam te\nbly.â\n[10]\tAs a result of Mr Mareeâs\ncancellation of the Momentum Life policy Mr Booysen lost the\ncommission he would otherwise have\nearned. This led to further\nacrimonious exchanges between them and ultimately to the litigation\nculminating in the present appeal.\nIt is clear from Mr Booysenâs\nevidence that he took the view that he was entitled to compensation\nbecause of the effort he had\nexpended in advising the appellant and\nprocuring the best available new policy for him.\n[11]\tIn his particulars of claim the\nfollowing is stated on behalf of Mr Booysen:\nâ\n3.\tEiser en verweerder\nhet ân ooreenkoms aangegaan waarvolgens eiser aan verweerder sekere\nadvies gelewer het in verband met sy\npolis portefeulje, welke advies\ndeur verweerder aanvaar is en is daar sekere polisse uitgeneem in\nterme van die advies.\n4.\tAs gevolg van die\nadvies is Eiser geregtig op sekere kommissie ten bedrae van\nR47 638, 27.â\n[12]\tAt this stage it is necessary to\nhave regard to the agreement on which Mr Booysenâs claim is based.\nThe following is the material\npart of the agreement:\nâ\nEk begryp en aanvaar\ndat enige versekeringsbesigheid namens my, deur my tussenganger\ngeplaas, voorsiening maak dat my tussenganger\ndeur die betrokke\nversekeraar vergoed sal word volgens die aard van die produk deur my\naanvaar, en soos op die kwotasie van die versekeraar/s\naan my\nvoorgelÃª, aangedui word. Ek en my tussenganger kom ooreen dat\nsodanige vergoeding deur ons beide aanvaar sal word as vergoeding\nvir\ndie dienste aan my gelewer. Indien my tussenganger se vergoeding\nteruggevorder word deur die versekeraar as gevolg van my eie\n(die\npolishouer) se optrede tot nadeel van die tussenganger, aanvaar ek,\ndie ondergetekende dat ek steeds verantwoordelik sal wees\nvir\ngenoemde, ooreengekome vergoeding.â\nThe âtussengangerâ (intermediary)\nis a reference to Mr Booysen.\n[13]\tI turn to deal with the manner in\nwhich the court below dealt with the Magistrateâs findings.\n[14]\t      Kruger J recorded that Mr\nBooysen accepted that he was not entitled to any commission from\nMomentum Life because of Mr\nMareeâs cancellation of the policy.\n3\nThe learned judge noted that the Magistrate had decided the matter on\nthe basis that the agreement on which Mr Booysen relied was\nin\ncontravention of the Act and that Mr Mareeâs assent amounted to a\nwaiver which was not competent.\n[15]\tThe court below found that Mr\nBooysen, as intermediary, had expended time and energy in procuring\nthe Momentum Life policy and,\nas a result of Mr Mareeâs\ncancellation, was now deprived of the commission he would otherwise\nhave earned. In considering\nthe statutory provisions the Free State\nHigh Court held that there was no prohibition against an agreement\nbetween an intermediary\nand his client, in this case, between Mr\nMaree and Mr Booysen in terms of which the latter was able to look to\nthe former for compensation.\nIt held that the Act did not deprive the\nintermediary of his right to recover commission that was his or her\ndue. Consequently the\ncourt below made the order set out in para 3\nabove. The question before us is whether these conclusions were\ncorrect.\n[16]\tAt this stage it is\nnecessary to consider the relevant statutory provisions, beginning\nwith Mr Mareeâs entitlement to cancel\nthe Momentum Life policy. In\nterms of Rule 6.1 of the Policyholder Protection Rules\n4\n(Long-Term Insurance), promulgated under s 62 of the Act, a new\npolicyholder has, what is commonly referred to as a âcooling-offâ\nperiod, within which to cancel any policy under appropriate\nqualifying circumstances. It is undisputed that Mr Maree was\nentitled\nin terms of this rule to cancel the policy.\n[17]\tSection 49 of the\nAct, the applicability of which was debated in the Magistratesâ\nCourt, in the court below and before us,\nprovides:\nâ\nNo consideration shall\nbe offered or provided by a long-term insurer or a person on behalf\nof the long-term insurer or accepted by\nany independent intermediary\nfor rendering services as intermediary as referred to in the\nregulations, other than commission contemplated\nin the regulations\nand otherwise than in accordance with the regulations.â\n[18]\t Importantly, s 56 of the Act\nprovides that an agreement, in terms of which a person who has\nentered into a long-term policy\nwaives a right to which he or she is\nby virtue of the Act entitled, is void.\n[19]\tSection 72(1)\n(d)\nof the Act empowers the Minister to make regulations âprohibiting\nany consideration from being offered or provided, or limiting\nthe\nconsideration which may be offered or provided, from, by or on behalf\nof a long-term insurer to any person for rendering services\nas\nintermediary. . .â.\n[20]\tThe material parts of regulation\n3.2 of the Regulations, promulgated in terms of s 72 of the Act,\n5\nechoes s 49 and reads as follows:\nâ\n3.2\nGeneral\nlimitations.â\n(1) No consideration shall, directly or indirectly, be provided to,\nor accepted by or on behalf of, an independent intermediary for\nrendering services as intermediary, otherwise than by way of the\npayment of commission in monetary form.\n(2)\tNo commission shall\nbe paid or accepted otherwise than in accordance generally with this\nPart and more particularly as specified\nin the Table.â\n[21]\tRegulation 3.8, consonant with s\n56 of the Act, provides as follows:\nâ\n3.8\nVoidness\nof certain agreements.â\nAny\nagreement,\nscheme or arrangement\nto provide consideration for the rendering of services as\nintermediary otherwise than in accordance with this Part shall be\nvoid.â\n(My emphasis.)\n[22]\tâRendering services as\nintermediaryâ is defined in the regulations as follows:\nâ\n[T]he performance by a\nperson other than a long-term insurer or a policyholder, on behalf of\na long-term insurer or a policyholder,\nof any act directed towards\nentering into, maintaining or servicing a policy or collecting,\naccounting for or paying premiums or\nproviding administrative\nservices in relation to a policy, and includes the performance of\nsuch an act in relation to a fund, a member\nof a fund and the\nagreement between the member and the fund.â\n[23]\t  Rule 19.1 of the Long-Term\nInsurance Policy Protection Rules, in line with s 56 of the Act and\nregulation 3.8, provides:\nâ\nNo insurer or\nintermediary may request or induce in any manner a policyholder to\nwaive any right or benefit conferred on the policyholder\nby or in\nterms of a provision of these Rules, or recognise, accept or act on\nany such waiver, and any such waiver is null and void.â\n[24]\tIt was submitted on behalf of Mr\nBooysen that s 49 was designed to regulate the relationship between\ninsurer and intermediary\nand not the relationship between\nintermediary and insured. Counsel on behalf of Mr Booysen contended\nthat s 49 ought to be read so\nas to limit its operation so as to\nensure that it does not intrude upon the common-law right of parties\nto provide separately for\nâconsiderationâ as between intermediary\nand insured.\n6\nIt was submitted that, at the very least, s 49 was ambiguous and that\ncourts should strive to avoid an interpretation that would\nbe absurd.\n[25]\tIt was contended further that the\nregulations and rules should be read in the light of the\ninterpretation of s 49 set out in\nthe preceding paragraph.\n[26]\tIt was submitted that an\nabsurdity flowed from holding that the agreement in question was\nprohibited in terms of the statutory\nprovisions referred to above The\nabsurdity, so it was submitted, was that an intermediary, such as\nMr Booysen would be deprived\nof his commission, notwithstanding\nthe efforts expended in procuring a new policy. No other example of\nan absurdity was provided\nby counsel on behalf of Mr Booysen.\n[27]\tThe stated purpose of the Policy\nProtection Rules is to ensure that intermediaries and insurers\nconduct their business honestly,\nfairly and with due care and\ndiligence.\n7\nSeveral provisions of the Act are designed to protect consumers.\n8\nThe âcooling-offâ period is clearly designed to afford proper\ntime to consider the full implications and impact of the policy\nin\nquestion, without the consumer incurring any financial penalty.\n[28]\tIn my view s 49 is not ambiguous.\nIt limits the consideration to be offered by a long-term insurer to\npersons such as intermediaries\nto commission as contemplated in the\nregulations. Furthermore, it restricts the consideration that may be\naccepted by an independent\nintermediary for rendering services as\nsuch, to commission as contemplated by the regulations.\n[29]\tRegulation 3.2, set out in para\n18 is equally clear and echoes the provisions of s 49. Regulation 3.8\nreferred to in para 18,\nin even clearer terms, renders void, â\nany\nagreement, scheme or arrangement to provide consideration for the\nrendering of services as intermediaryâ other than in accordance\nwith the regulations. (My emphasis.) It has not been suggested that\nthese regulations, in their emphatic and unambiguous terms are\nultra\nvires\n.\n[30]\tIt is common cause that in the\ncircumstances of this case, namely, the cancellation within the\nâcooling-offâ period, no commission\nis payable by Momentum  Life\nto Mr Booysen, in terms of the tables and formulae provided for in\nthe regulations.\n[31]\tIn my view, the provisions of s\n49, read with the regulations referred to in preceding paragraphs,\nprohibit agreements of the\nkind on which Mr Booysen relies.\n[32]\tIf such agreements were to be\nenforced it would have the effect of penalising a consumer\nfinancially for exercising the statutory\nright to cancel a policy\nwithin the âcooling-offâ period. The result of enforcing the\nagreement would be to hold a consumer liable\nfor the loss of a\ncommission that never accrued. It is that very situation that the\nlegislature was keen to avoid.\n[33]\tMr Booysen is aggrieved that he\nhas not been compensated for the effort expended in procuring the\nMomentum Life policy. The evidence\nadduced shows that this grievance\nis exaggerated. Furthermore, Mr Booysen was not unaware of the\nconsumerâs right to cancel a policy\nwithin the âcooling-offâ\nperiod. The statutory provisions relating to restrictions on\ncommission set out above are provisions\nwhich should be familiar to\nintermediaries.\n[34]\tOne final aspect remains. The\nMagistrateâs order granting Mr Mareeâs counterclaim was, in the\nlight of his conclusion in\nrespect of the agreement on which Mr\nBooysen relied, unnecessary and unjustified and liable to be set\naside with an attendant costs\norder. Before us no time was spent on\nthis issue, save that Mr Maree, in heads of argument, submitted that\nthe Magistrateâs order\non this aspect should be set aside. In the\ncourt below some time was devoted to the appellantâs counterclaim.\nThe parties are agreed\nthat 20 per cent is a fair estimate in this\nregard and that in the event that Mr Maree is successful in the\npresent appeal his entitlement\nto costs should be reduced in that\npercentage.\n[35]\tFollowing on the conclusions\nreached above the following order is made:\n1.\tThe appeal is upheld with costs.\n2.\tThe order of the court below is set\naside and substituted as follows:\nâ\n(a)\tThe appeal is dismissed and the\nappellant is ordered to pay 80 per cent of the respondentâs costs.â\nThe Magistrateâs order is changed to\nthe following extent:\nâ\n(a)\tThe plaintiffâs claim is\ndismissed with costs.\n(b)\tThe defendantâs counterclaim is\ndismissed with costs.â\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\nAppellant:\tB Knoetze SC\nInstructed\nby\nHSL\nDu Plessis Attorneys Kroonstad\nHoney\nAttorneys Bloemfontein\nFor\nRespondent:\tP R CronjÃ©\nInstructed\nby\nThabo\nGrimbeek Attorneys Kroonstad\nNaudes\nBloemfontein\n1\nThis means that the policy holder ceases paying premiums and the\n\tpolicy then holds a reduced value upon maturity, relative to\n\npremiums paid plus the investment value.\n2\nM C Ingenieurswerke CC is one of Mr Mareeâs businesses.\n3\nMr Maree was entitled in terms of the rules promulgated in terms of\n\tthe Act to cancel the policy within a 30 day-period of receipt\nof\n\tsummarised information from Momentum Life â see para 16 infra.\n4\nGovernment Gazette No 26854, Government Notice No 1129, Regulation\n\t8070.\n5\nGovernment Gazette No 19495, Government Notice 1492 of 27 November\n\t1998 as amended.\n6\nIn this regard Mr Booysen relied on Directive 132.A.ii (LT) of 30\n\tJanuary 2004 issued by the Registrar of Long-Term Insurance\n\n(Financial Services Board). In this Directive approving of this\n\tinterpretation the Registrarâs office nevertheless indicated that\n\tit intended to promote a legislative amendment to place this matter\n\tbeyond doubt.\n7\nSee Rule 2 and Peter Havenga\nThe\n\tLaw of Insurance Intermediaries\n(2001) p 55.\n8\nSection 45 of the Act for example is designed to protect the\n\tconsumer against unscrupulous salespersons who offer the prospective\n\tpolicyholder inducements to enter into policies. The golden thread\n\trunning through the history of insurance legislation in South\nAfrica\n\tis a commitment to consumer protection and to provide protection\n\tagainst undesirable business practices. Section 48 provides\nfor\n\tmaterial information to be made available to a policyholder. Section\n\t49 referred to above bears the heading\nLimitation\n\tof remuneration to intermediaries\n.",

    "facts": "Mr Chris Booysen, an insurance broker trading as NVM Beleggings & Versekeringsadviseurs, advised Mr P P Maree to cancel a Sanlam annuity and replace it with a Momentum Life policy in July 2006. Maree later cancelled the Momentum policy within the statutory cooling‑off period. Booysen claimed R47,638.27 in commission under a written agreement that said he would be compensated for services even if the policy was later cancelled. The Magistrates' Court dismissed the claim, the Free State High Court reversed that decision, and the matter was appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised whether an agreement that entitles an intermediary to commission for a policy that is cancelled within the cooling‑off period is enforceable, in light of s 49 and s 56 of the Long‑Term Insurance Act 52 of 1998, the accompanying regulations and the Policy Protection Rules, and whether such an agreement constitutes an unlawful waiver of the policyholder’s statutory right to cancel without penalty.",
    "principles": "Section 49 limits any consideration offered by a long‑term insurer to an independent intermediary to commission as contemplated in the regulations. Section 56 renders void any agreement that waives a statutory right conferred on a policyholder. Regulation 3.2 echoes s 49, and Regulation 3.8 expressly voids any agreement providing consideration beyond the permitted commission. Rule 19.1 of the Policy Protection Rules bans any waiver of a policyholder’s rights. These provisions are designed to protect consumers and to prevent financial penalties for exercising the cooling‑off right.",
    "application": "The Court examined the agreement between Booysen and Maree and found that it sought commission despite the policy’s cancellation within the cooling‑off period, which is prohibited by the regulations. No commission is payable under the prescribed tables for a cancelled policy. Enforcing the agreement would penalise the consumer for lawfully cancelling the policy, contrary to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, the agreement is void, and Booysen is not entitled to the claimed commission. The Court also considered the costs orders, noting that the Magistrate’s order granting Maree’s counterclaim was unjustified.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal is upheld. The order of the lower court is set aside and substituted: the appeal is dismissed and the appellant (Maree) is ordered to pay 80 % of the respondent’s costs. The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs, and the defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed with costs."
