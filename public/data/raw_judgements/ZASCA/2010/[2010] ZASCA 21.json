According to\n\tthe particulars of claim, De Lange, acting in the course of\nhis\n\temployment, gave certain financial and investment advice to various\n\tclients, which advice was âincorrect or incompleteâ\nand that, in\n\tgiving such advice, De Lange acted intentionally or, alternatively,\n\tnegligently. The clients in question allegedly\nsuffered loss as a\n\tresult of De Langeâs advice, for which they were compensated by\n\tABSA. Relying on the provisions of clause\n16.6, ABSA sued De Lange\n\tfor recovery of the amounts paid to these clients by ABSA. There\n\twere 15 claims in all, but following\na special plea of prescription,\n\tABSA abandoned the first three claims. At the outset of the trial,\n\tthe parties agreed that only\ntwo of the claims â claims 4 and 10 â\n\twould be placed before the trial court for determination as âtest\n\tcasesâ and that\nthe fate of the remaining claims would follow the\n\toutcome of the trial in respect of claims 4 and 10; in other words,\n\tif ABSA succeeded\nwith these two claims, then the remaining claims\n\twould also succeed, and vice versa. ABSAâs claims 4 and 10 did\n\tindeed succeed\nin the court a quo, hence this appeal, which comes\n\tbefore us with the leave of the court below.\nFactual background\nDe Lange was\n\temployed by ABSA as a broker from 1995 to 2001. On 6 December 2001,\n\tthe parties concluded a written contract of employment,\neffective\n\tfrom 1 September 2000, clause 2.1 of which provided that any\n\tprevious agreement, whether of employment or otherwise,\nbetween the\n\tparties was cancelled, subject to certain provisos, none of which is\n\trelevant to this appeal.\nDuring the course\n\tof his employment with ABSA, De Lange gave financial and/or\n\tinvestment advice to various clients of ABSA, including\na Mr Loubser\n\t(claim 4) and a Mr and Mrs Honiball (claim 10). All three clients\n\ttestified at the trial.\nAccording to Mr\n\tLoubser (âLoubserâ), he was 62 years old at the time of the\n\ttrial. He had formerly been a member of the South\nAfrican Police\n\tService (âSAPSâ) and had invested the cash amount which he\n\treceived upon his retirement from SAPS. As the investment\nturned out\n\tnot to be a good one, causing him to lose a considerable portion of\n\this capital, he consulted De Lange in about January\n2001 (at which\n\ttime he would have been about 54 years of age) and requested him for\n\tinvestment advice. He wanted a safe investment\nwhich would also\n\tprovide him with a monthly income for living expenses. On the\n\tstrength of De Langeâs advice, he took out a number\nof policies,\n\tinvesting his capital of R320 000 in a cashbuilder (annuity) policy\n\twhich gave him a monthly income, more than half\nof which was used to\n\tfund the premiums on three endowment policies with Liberty Group Ltd\n\tand two further endowment policies with\nMomentum Ltd. The term of\n\tthe latter two policies was ten years, while that of the former\n\tthree policies was five years. All the\nendowment policies were\n\tinvested in overseas shares, with no distribution of risk amongst\n\tvarious different investment âdestinationsâ.\nDuring August 2003,\n\tLoubser realised that the greater part of his capital had been\n\teroded. He thus made a statement which was given\nto ABSA, setting\n\tout the background to his taking out the various policies and\n\tpointing out that he had suffered loss as a result\nof De Langeâs\n\tadvice.\nLoubserâs\n\tposition was investigated on behalf of ABSA by a Mr van Reenen (âVan\n\tReenenâ), an accountant in ABSAâs employ.\nVan Reenen testified\n\tthat, although he interviewed Loubser, he did not contact De Lange\n\tand afford him the opportunity to explain\nhis version of events\n\t(first, because De Lange was no longer employed by ABSA and,\n\tfurther, because he did not regard it as his\nduty, or within the\n\tambit of his authority as investigator, to do so). Van Reenen\n\tfurther testified under cross-examination that,\nhad De Lange still\n\tbeen in ABSAâs employ, then the process of investigation would\n\talso have required obtaining a statement from\nDe Lange. Moreover,\n\talthough he tried to access Loubserâs ABSA client file, it was\n\tmissing and he was thus unable to âverifyâ\nthe information in\n\tthat file. He also indicated under cross-examination that a client\n\tfile should contain an analysis of the clientâs\ninvestment needs\n\tand risk profile, as well as the reasons for the brokerâs\n\târecommendationâ to the client.\nIn his report to the ABSA Head Office dated 12 May 2004, Van Reenen\n\tconcluded that De Lange had provided poor advice (âswak adviesâ)\n\tto Loubser and had given him a wrong impression (â[het] klient . .\n\t. onder ân wanindruk geplaasâ). He recommended that ABSA\n\tcompensate Loubser in the amount of R81 208.55 for the loss which he\n\thad sustained. This amount was calculated by taking the capital\n\tamount initially invested by Loubser, adding to it interest at the\n\tmoney market rate over the relevant period, then subtracting\nthe\n\ttotal income paid out to Loubser in terms of the annuity policy, as\n\twell as the total amount ultimately paid out under the\nendowment\n\tpolicies.\nThis recommendation was accepted by Mr le Roux, the managing (and\n\tfinancial) director of ABSA, who was the person with the authority\n\tto make the decision (in terms of clause 16.6)\n2\nwhether ABSA would compensate a client for loss allegedly suffered.\n\tIn making the decision that ABSA was indeed legally liable\n(âregtens\n\taanspreeklikâ) for Loubserâs loss, Le Roux also did not afford\n\tDe Lange any opportunity to give his version of\nevents. The\n\tabovementioned amount of R81 208.55 was paid out to Loubser on about\n\t14 May 2004. This was the amount that ABSA claimed\nfrom De Lange\n\tunder claim 4.\nAs regards claim 10, Mr Honiball was a 68-year-old pensioner at the\n\ttime of the trial. He had previously worked for LTA as a\n\tconstruction\nforeman and, upon his retirement, he had received a\n\tlump sum pension payment of about R285 000. He had been a client of\n\tAbsa Bank\nfor some 35 years and thus, in about May 2000 (when he\n\twould have been about 59 years old), he sought advice from the\n\tMossel Bay\nbranch of ABSA, in the person of De Lange, concerning the\n\tinvestment of this lump sum in a manner which would provide the\n\tHoniballs\nwith a monthly income, as well as ensure that the capital\n\tremained intact.\nDe Lange recommended that the Honiballs cash in their other\n\tinvestments (Absa Bank shares and several policies with Sanlam) and\n\tthat the proceeds thereof, together with the lump sum pension payout\n\t(a total amount of R503 000), be invested in five Sanlam cashbuilder\n\t(annuity) policies for a period of five years. Of the monthly income\n\tgenerated by these policies, approximately two-thirds was\nused to\n\tpay the premiums on five endowment policies with Sanlam, two in the\n\tname of Mr Honiball and three in the name of Mrs Honiball,\nthe\n\tbalance being paid to the Honiballs as a monthly income. The term of\n\tall five endowment policies was 10 years. As in Loubserâs\ncase,\n\tall the endowment policies were invested in overseas shares, with no\n\tdistribution of risk.\nIn due course, Mr Honiball realised that his capital was diminishing\n\tand made enquiries with ABSAâs Mossel Bay Branch, only to\ndiscover\n\tthat De Lange was no longer employed by ABSA and that their files\n\thad been âfrozenâ. Thereafter, on 15 October 2004,\nMr and Mrs\n\tHoniball wrote to ABSA, demanding that ABSA (and Sanlam) investigate\n\tthe matter and that they be compensated, at the\nvery least, for the\n\tcapital which they had invested on De Langeâs advice.\nThe Honiballâs matter was then investigated on behalf of ABSA by\n\tMs Joubert (âJoubertâ), also an accountant in ABSAâs employ.\n\tPart of the information which Joubert considered in the course of\n\ther investigation was the letter written to ABSA by the Honiballs.\n\tShe also telephoned the Honiballs to enquire whether they had\n\tadditional information and they telefaxed to her several pages in\nDe\n\tLangeâs handwriting which were apparently used by De Lange to\n\texplain various investment options to the Honiballs at the time\nthey\n\tsought his advice. She did not, however, ask De Lange for his\n\tversion of events or even for an explanation of his handwritten\n\tnotes â in her opinion any âinputâ by De Lange would not have\n\tchanged the facts of the matter and she did not deem it necessary\n\tfor the purposes of her investigation. She conceded that she could\n\thave contacted the Honiballs to ascertain the meaning of certain\nof\n\tthe handwritten pages (which she was unable to explain to the\n\tcourt), but that she did not. According to Joubert, she did not\ntake\n\tthese pages into account in making her âdecisionâ. She also did\n\tnot access the ABSA client files of the Honiballs, although\nshe\n\tconceded that a client file should contain an analysis of the\n\tclientâs existing investments, as well as a risk analysis by\nthe\n\trelevant broker to determine what the clientâs risk profile was.\nIn a report and memorandum addressed to the ABSA Head Office (both\n\tdated 22 November 2004), Joubert concluded that De Lange was\n\tâguiltyâ, giving as her reasons the fact that the term of the\n\tannuity policies was five years while that of the endowment policies\n\twas ten years, meaning that the client would not be able to fund the\n\tlatter policies for the second five-year period. She also\npointed\n\tout the latter policies were invested in high-risk overseas shares,\n\twith no distribution of risk. She thus recommended\nthat an amount of\n\tR188 809.77 be paid to the Honiballs as compensation for the\n\tloss they had sustained. This amount was calculated\nin exactly the\n\tsame manner used in respect of claim 4 (ie Loubserâs claim).\n3\nJoubertâs\n\trecommendation was forwarded to Le Roux, who decided (in terms of\n\tclause 16.6) that ABSA was legally liable to the Honiballs\nand thus\n\taccepted Joubertâs recommendation. As in Loubserâs case, Le Roux\n\tsimply relied on the documents sent to him by the\ninvestigator\n\t(Joubert) and made no further enquiries himself. On or about 24\n\tNovember 2004, Le Roux approved payment of the abovementioned\namount\n\tto the Honiballs. This was the amount claimed by ABSA from De Lange\n\tin terms of claim 10.\nThe\n\thigh court\nIn interpreting\n\tclause 16.6 of the contract of employment, the court below\n\temphasised that the question was not whether ABSA was,\nas a fact,\n\tâlegally liableâ vis Ã  vis the relevant clients, but rather\n\twhether ABSA had\nreasonably\nformed the opinion that it was\n\tindeed legally liable.  ABSAâs opinion was thus not unfettered,\n\tbut had to be based on reasonable\ngrounds. In other words, ABSAâs\n\tdiscretion in this regard had to be exercised\narbitrium boni\n\tviri\n, âwith the judgment of a fair-minded personâ. This set\n\tan objective standard, with which the court would not normally\n\tinterfere\nunless it was of the view that the decision was so\n\tunreasonable, improper, irregular or incorrect that it would give\n\trise to obvious\nunfairness.\n4\nAccording to the\n\thigh court, the\naudi alteram partem\nprinciple was not\n\tâautomaticallyâ included in the concept of\narbitrium boni\n\tviri\n.\n5\nThe high court agreed with the argument advanced by counsel for\n\tABSA, pointing out the distinction drawn in our law between\narbitri\n(arbitrators), on the one hand, and\narbitratores\n(valuers\n\tor\naestimatores)\n, on the other. With reference to\nEstate\n\tMilne v Donohoe Investments (Pty) Ltd & others\n6\nand\nPerdikis v Jamieson\n,\n7\nthe high court appeared to regard ABSAâs role, in the context of\n\tclause 16.6, as that of a ârefereeâ acting as a âvaluerâ\n\t(\narbitrator\nor aestimator), and not that of an arbitrator\n\t(\narbiter\n) who performs a quasi-judicial function.\n8\nAccording to the court, therefore, ABSA could decide the question\n\tbefore it without hearing either party, and could form its opinion\n\tindependently on its own knowledge and experience.\n9\nIn my view, this\n\tapproach was incorrect. The matter is not simply one of\n\tclassification. In given circumstances valuers may, by\nvirtue of a\n\ttacit term, have at least to hear both sides. In any event, in this\n\tcase ABSA was neither an arbitrator nor a valuer.\nIt was called upon\n\tto judge an issue and create a liability. Having regard to the main\n\tdefence raised by De Lange,\n10\nthe first question to be asked in interpreting clause 16.6 was\n\twhether it contained the tacit term relied on by De Lange. If it\n\tdid, then\ncaedit questio.\nTacit\n\tterm\nIn his plea, De Lange contended that it was a tacit term of the\n\tcontract of employment that, when ABSA was âheld liableâ\n\t(âaangespreek\nwordâ) for loss or damage, in accordance with\n\tclause 16.6 of the contract, then, as part of the process of forming\n\tan opinion\nin regard to the question whether ABSA was legally liable\n\tto the relevant third party, ABSA â\nâ\n1.\n\talle relevante feite in ag sal neem, insluitende maar nie beperk nie\n\ttot die omstandighede wat geheers het tydens die verskaffing\nvan\n\tadvies deur [De Lange] aan derdes asook [De Lange] se weergawe van\n\tgebeure; en\n2.\n[ABSA] die\naudi\n\talteram partem\n-reÃ«l\n\tsal eerbiedig deur [De Lange] die geleentheid te gee om sy kant van\n\tdie saak te stel voordat [ABSA] ân mening vorm met\nbetrekking tot\n\tdie vraag of [ABSA] regtens aanspreeklik is teenoor ân spesifieke\n\tderde.â\n11\nThe test for establishing the existence of a tacit term, which this\n\tcourt has recognised and applied in many cases, is the so-called\n\tâbystanderâ or âofficious bystanderâ test.\n12\nIn\nCity of Cape Town (CMC Administration) v Bourbon-Leftley &\n\tanother NNO\n,\n13\nBrand JA set out the legal principles governing tacit terms as\n\tfollows:\nâ\n[19] .\n\t. . [A] tacit term is based on an inference of what both parties\n\tmust or would necessarily have agreed to, but which, for\nsome reason\n\tor other, remained unexpressed. Like all other inferences,\n\tacceptance of the proposed tacit term is entirely dependent\non the\n\tfacts. But, as also appears from the cases referred to, a tacit term\n\tis not easily inferred by the courts. The reason for\nthis reluctance\n\tis closely linked to the postulate that the courts can neither make\n\tcontracts for people nor supplement their agreements\nmerely because\n\tit appears reasonable or convenient to do so (see eg\nAlfred\n\tMcAlpine & Son (Pty) Ltd v Transvaal Provincial Administration\n1974 (3) SA 506\n(A) at 532H). It follows that a term cannot be\n\tinferred because it would, on the application of the well-known\n\tâofficious bystanderâ\ntest, have been unreasonable of one of the\n\tparties not to agree to it upon the bystander's suggestion. Nor can\n\tit be inferred because\nit would be convenient and might therefore\n\tvery well have been incorporated in the contract if the parties had\n\tthought about it\nat the time. A proposed tacit term can only be\n\timported into a contract if the court is satisfied that the parties\n\twould\nnecessarily\nhave agreed upon such a term if it had been suggested to them at the\n\ttime (see eg\nAlfred McAlpine\n(supra)\nat 532H-533B\n\tand\nConsol Ltd t/a Consol Glass (supra)\nat para [50]). If the inference is that the response by one of the\n\tparties to the bystander's question might have been that he\nwould\n\tfirst like to discuss and consider the suggested term, the\n\timportation of the term would not be justified.\n[20]\n\tIn deciding whether the suggested term can be inferred, the court\n\twill have regard primarily to the express terms of the contract\nand\n\tto the surrounding circumstances under which it was entered into.\nIt has also been recognised in some cases, however,\n\tthat the subsequent conduct of the parties can be indicative of the\n\tpresence\nor absence of the proposed tacit term (see eg\nWilkins\n\tv Voges (supra)\nat 143C-E;\nBotha\n\tv Coopers & Lybrand (supra)\nat para\n\t[25].â\n14\nAn examination of the express provisions of clause 16.6 makes it\n\tclear that these do not âimmediately exclude the possibility\nof\n\timportingâ\n15\nthe tacit term pleaded by De Lange. Clause 16.6 effectively makes it\n\tpossible for ABSA to impose a potentially unlimited liability\nupon\n\tDe Lange simply by forming the âopinionâ that ABSA is legally\n\tliable vis Ã  vis a client who has allegedly suffered loss\nor damage\n\tas a result of intentional or negligent incorrect or incomplete\n\tadvice given by De Lange, and by paying out to the client\nsuch loss\n\tor damage as ABSA may determine the client has sustained. In my\n\tview, the importation of the tacit term pleaded by De\nLange would\n\tensure that clause 16.6 âfunctions efficientlyâ\n16\nand fairly. Indeed, the form for the so-called âreportâ\n\t(âverslagâ) to the ABSA Head Office, which must be completed by\n\tthe ABSA employee doing the investigation (and making the\n\trecommendation) â in this case, Van Reenen and Joubert,\n\trespectively\nâ and submitted to Le Roux to enable him to make a\n\tdecision (âform an opinionâ) in terms of clause 16.6, makes\n\tprovision\nfor various documents/information to be annexed to it.\nThese include âtoestemming tot debitering van\n\trekening â makelaarâ; âappÃ¨l teen bevinding â makelaarâ;\n\târeÃ«lings\nvir afbetaling met makelaarâ; âdissiplinÃªre stappe\n\tword geneemâ; âdatum waarop verhoor plaasvindâ and âklagstaat\n\tvan\ndissiplinÃªre verhoorâ.\n17\nAll this documentation/information presupposes the\n\tinvolvement of the broker in the process of investigation and, in my\n\tview, indicates\nthat, at the time of concluding the contract of\n\temployment, ABSA itself thought that, before a decision could be\n\tmade in terms\nof clause 16.6, the broker concerned would have had to\n\tbe involved in the investigative process.\nCounsel for ABSA argued that, while clause 16.6 may well contain a\n\ttacit term of the kind relied upon by De Lange, this tacit term\n\twould be limited to the situation where the âoffendingâ broker\n\twas still in ABSAâs employ.\nIn my view, there is no indication in clause 16.6 or in any of the\n\tother provisions of the contract of employment that, should\nthe\n\trelevant tacit term be imported into clause 16.6 of the contract, it\n\twould be limited in this way. It is true that, in terms\nof clause 27\n\tof the contract, if the broker in question is still in ABSAâs\n\temploy, he or she can dispute the decision taken by\nABSA in terms of\n\tclause 16.6 and, if the dispute cannot be resolved through the\n\tmediation and/or conciliation process of the Commission\nfor\n\tConciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, then the broker can refer\n\tthe dispute to the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa\nfor\n\tarbitration.\nIt is also true that certain of the documents/information referred\n\tto in paragraph 19 above as possible annexures to the report\n(and\n\trecommendation) form submitted by the relevant âinvestigatorâ to\n\tLe Roux appear to presuppose that the broker is still\nin ABSAâs\n\temploy (eg the reference to disciplinary steps, a disciplinary\n\thearing, the charge sheet of the disciplinary hearing),\nbut this is\n\tnot the case with other documents/information referred to (such as\n\tthe consent by the broker to debiting his or her\naccount, an appeal\n\tby the broker against the finding, arrangements with the broker for\n\tpaying the âdebtâ off). All the latter\ndocumentation would seem\n\tto apply equally to a situation where the broker is no longer in\n\tABSAâs employ. The mere fact that,\nif still in ABSAâs employ,\n\tthe broker concerned may have additional remedies open to him or\n\ther, certainly does not justify the\ncontention by counsel for ABSA\n\tthat, while a tacit term of the kind pleaded by De Lange may well\n\tform part of the contract, it\ndoes\nnot\napply to the situation\n\twhere the broker is no longer in ABSAâs employ.\nIn considering the surrounding circumstances under which the\n\tcontract was entered into â\nâ\nOne\n\tis certainly entitled to assume, in the absence of indications to\n\tthe contrary, that the parties to the agreement are typical\nmen of\n\taffairs, contracting on an equal and honest footing, without hidden\n\tmotives and reservations.â\n18\nIn\n\tthis regard, the following evidence given by Le Roux under\n\tcross-examination is particularly relevant:\n19\nâ\nHet dit ooit oor u gedagtes gekom dat u miskien net\n\tvir die ondersoeker moet vra wat sÃª mnr De Lange van hierdie\n\tbeleggings? â\nEk kan nie onthou of ek so iets gedink het en dalk\n\tgevra het nie.\nHier\n\tskryf mnr Van Schalkwyk vir u ses maande voor die Honiball besluit\n\tdaar is geen inligting voor hom van die maakelaar nie. Toe\ndie\n\tHoniball aanbeveling voor u dien, het u nie gesÃª maar verskoon my\n\tnet, wat sÃª mnr De Lange van hierdie saak nie? â Ek weet\nnie. Ek\n\tkan nie onthou wat ek gesÃª het of gedink het nie.\nSal u met my saamstem, mnr Le Roux, dat ân volledige\n\tondersoek sal insluit dat die ondersoeker beide kante van die saak\n\tondersoek\nen nie net een kant nie? â Dit maak vir my sin dat ja.\nDit\n\tis wat redelikerwys verwag word of verstaan word onder die woord\n\tâondersoekâ? â Korrek.â\n20\nThe allusion to the communication sent to Le Roux by Mr van\n\tSchalkwyk (âVan Schalkwykâ) refers to an e-mail dated 13 May\n\t2004,\nsent by Van Schalkwyk to, inter alia, Le Roux. Le Roux\n\ttestified that Van Schalkwyk was a legal services consultant, the\n\thead of\nABSAâs legal services division. The e-mail dealt with the\n\tcomplaint by Loubser (claim 4) and seems to have been sent around\n\tthe\ntime Le Roux decided to accept Van Reenenâs recommendation and\n\tpay âdamagesâ to Loubser. In this e-mail, Van Schalkwyk\n\tindicated\nthat he had perused the file relating to Loubserâs\n\tcomplaint and highlighted various aspects which he thought required\n\tattention.\nThese included the following:\nThere was no form of comment from the broker concerned. Van\n\tSchalkwyk stated that he was aware of the fact that the broker was\n\tno longer in ABSAâs employ, but that he could not find any attempt\n\tmade by ABSA to obtain the brokerâs âside of the matterâ.\nIn spite of the fact that the broker concerned was plainly not given\n\ta hearing in the course of the investigation, a decision was\ntaken\n\tto pay an amount of more than R80 000 to the client.\nMoreover, despite the fact that the brokerâs version of events was\n\tnot obtained, it was nonetheless decided to hold him liable\nfor this\n\tamount. Van Schalkwyk pointed out that ABSA would have to sue the\n\tbroker and the relevant court would certainly take into\naccount the\n\tfact that ABSA had obtained no explanation from the broker and\n\tâpossibly hold this fact againstâ ABSA (âmoontlik\nteen ons\n\thouâ). It was possible that the broker would be able to give the\n\tcourt a good explanation of why he gave the advice\nin question to\n\tthe client and, in this case, ABSA would have paid the client\n\twithout needing to do so.\nFinally, Van Schalkwyk expressed the view that there was in any\n\tevent not enough information to form a âgoodâ opinion as to\n\twhether the broker acted negligently/intentionally or was\n\tâinnocentâ.\nAs indicated above, these concerns expressed by Van Schalkwyk had\n\tbeen sent to Le Roux at about the same time that he took the\n\tdecision to pay Loubserâs âclaimâ, and more than six months\n\tbefore he took the decision to pay the Honiballsâ âclaimâ.\nIn\n\tspite of this (and of his testimony set out in paragraph 23 above),\n\the did not require the respective investigators to give\nDe Lange the\n\topportunity to furnish ABSA with the latterâs side of the story,\n\tnor did he find it necessary to do so himself,\nbefore âforming his\n\topinionâ in terms of clause 16.6 and taking the decision to pay\n\tâdamagesâ to the respective clients.\nAll the above must also be seen in the light of the fact that, in\n\tboth cases, the so-called investigation did not include perusing\nthe\n\tclient files of either Loubser or the Honiballs. In the case of the\n\tformer, it would appear from Van Reenenâs evidence that\nLoubserâs\n\tfile had gone missing, whereas in the case of the latter, Joubertâs\n\tevidence was to the effect that she made no attempt\nto access the\n\tHoniballâs client file at the Mossel Bay branch as she was of the\n\tview that the information she had obtained from\nSanlam about the\n\tpolicies taken out by the Honiballs was âsufficient proofâ to\n\tmake a decision. This despite the fact that,\nlike Loubser, she\n\ttestified that the client file should contain a risk analysis done\n\tby the broker to ascertain the risk profile\nof the client in\n\tquestion. She also conceded that it would not be inappropriate for a\n\tpensioner to make the kind of investment\ntaken out by the Honiballs\n\ton De Langeâs advice, if his or her risk profile allowed it.\nConsidering, as I am required to do, the express terms of the\n\tcontract and the surrounding circumstances under which it was\n\tentered\ninto, as well as the subsequent conduct of the parties, I am\n\tfirmly of the view that the tacit term pleaded by De Lange can, and\n\tshould, indeed be imported into the contract of employment between\n\tABSA and De Lange. To use the words of Scrutton LJ in the frequently\n\tquoted case of\nReigate v Union Manufacturing Co\n,\n21\nit can certainly be said that this tacit term â\nâ\n.\n\t. . is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the\n\tcontract; that is . . . it is such a term that you can be confident\n\tthat if at the time the contract was being negotiated someone had\n\tsaid to the parties: âWhat will happen in such a case?â they\n\twould have both replied: âOf course so-and-so. We did not trouble\n\tto say that; it is too clear.â â\nAs it is common cause that this tacit term was not complied with by\n\tABSA in forming its opinion and making its decision in terms\nof\n\tclause 16.6, it follows that ABSAâs claims against De Lange, based\n\tentirely on the provisions of this clause, should have\nbeen\n\tdismissed by the high court.\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary to deal with any of the other\n\targuments advanced by counsel for each party and I do not\npropose to\n\tdo so.\nOrder\nThe following order\n\tis therefore made:\nThe appeal succeeds with costs.\nThe order of the high court is set aside and replaced with the\n\tfollowing:\nâClaims\n\t4 to 15 are dismissed with costs.â\n______________________\nB\nJ\n\tVAN HEERDEN\nJUDGE OF APPEal\nCounsel For Appellant:\t\tD J Coetzee\nInstructed by:\t\t\tNico\n\tSmit Inc\nGEORGE\nCorrespondents:\t\t\tHoney\n\tAttorneys\nBLOEMFONTEIN\nCounsel for\n\tRespondent:\t\t\tB C Stoop\nInstructed\n\tBy:\t\t\tErasmus Inc\np/a Bisset Boehmke\n\tMcBlain\nCAPE TOWN\nCorrespondents:\t\t\tNaudes\n\tAttorneys\nBLOEMFONTEIN\n1\nâThe Company is not liable for any loss or\n\tdamage which may be suffered as a result of intentional or negligent\n\tincorrect or incomplete\nadvice given by the Employee or the\n\tEmployeeâs agents and if the Company is held liable for any such\n\tloss or damage, the Company\nwill accordingly have a right of\n\trecovery against the Employee for any such damage or loss as is paid\n\tby the Company if the Company\nis of the opinion that the Company was\n\tlegally liable therefor.â (My translation).\n2\nThe provisions of which are quoted in full in para 2 above.\n3\nSee para 9 above.\n4\nSee the judgment of the Western Cape High Court\n\t(Case No. 10367/06), delivered on 10 March 2009, para 20.\n5\nIbid p\nara 24, read with paras 21-22.\n6\n1967 (2) SA 359\n(A) at 373H-374C.\n7\n2002 (6) SA 356\n(W) para 5.\n8\nSee the j\nudgment of the high court para 23.\n9\nSee the judgment of the high court para 23-24,\n\tciting\nEstate Milne\nloc\n\tcit.\n10\nSee the next paragraph.\n11\nâ1. will take into account all relevant facts,\n\tincluding but not limited to the circumstances prevailing at        \n\t         \n                         the time [De Lange] gave advice\n\tto third parties, as well as [De Langeâs] version of events; and\n2.\n\twill respect the\naudi alteram\n\tpartem\n-rule by giving [De Lange] the\n\topportunity to present his side of the matter before [ABSA] forms an\n\topinion in respect of the question\nwhether [ABSA] is legally liable\n\tto a specific third party.â (My translation).\n12\nSee eg\nAlfred McAlpine & Son (Pty) Ltd v Transvaal Provincial\n\tAdministration\n1974 (3) SA 506\n(A) at 532H-533B;\nWilkins NO v\n\tVoges\n[1994] ZASCA 53\n;\n1994 (3) SA 130\n(A) at 136H-137D;\nBotha v Coopers &\n\tLybrand\n2002 (5) SA 347\n(SCA) paras 22-25 and\nConsol Ltd t/a\n\tConsol Glass v Twee Jonge Gezellen (Pty) Ltd\n2005 (6) SA 1\n(SCA)\n\tparas 50-51.\n13\n2006 (3) SA 488\n(SCA).\n14\nParas 19-20.\n15\nR H Christie, assisted by Victoria McFarlane\nThe\n\tLaw of Contract in South Africa\n5ed\n\t(2006) p 169.\n16\nWilkins NO v Voges\nabove\n\tn 12 at 137B-C.\n17\nâConsent to debiting of account â brokerâ;\n\tâappeal against finding â brokerâ; âarrangements with broker\n\tfor paying\n[the brokerâs debt to ABSA] offâ; âdisciplinary\n\tsteps are takenâ; âdate on which hearing takes placeâ and\n\tâcharge\nsheet of disciplinary hearingâ (all my translation).\n18\nWilkins NO v Voges\nabove\n\tn 12 at 141C-D.\n19\nCf in this regard\nRichard\n\tEllis South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Miller\n1990\n\t(1) SA 453\n(T) at 460B-461B.

    "facts": "Johan de Lange was employed by ABSA Makelaars (Edms) Bpk as a broker from 1995 to 2001. While employed he gave investment advice to clients, notably Mr Loubser (claim 4) and Mr and Mrs Honiball (claim 10). The advice was later judged to be incorrect or incomplete, leading to client losses. ABSA paid compensation to the clients (R81,208.55 to Loubser and R188,809.77 to the Honiballs) and then sought recovery from De Lange under clause 16.6 of his employment contract, which makes the employee liable for losses the company pays out if it deems itself legally liable. The investigations were carried out by ABSA staff (Van Reenen and Joubert) who did not interview De Lange or obtain his version of events, and the decision makers (Le Roux) formed an opinion and approved payment without giving De Lange a hearing.",
    "issues": "The central issue was whether clause 16.6 contains a tacit term obligating ABSA to afford De Lange a hearing (audi alteram partem) before forming the opinion that the company was legally liable and before seeking recovery from him. Related sub‑issues included whether the court should import such a tacit term into the contract and whether ABSA’s exercise of discretion was unreasonable or contrary to the principle of arbitrium boni viri.",
    "principles": "The court applied the test for a tacit term (the \"officious bystander\" test) as articulated in City of Cape Town v Bourbon‑Leftley and other authorities. It considered the need for a fair‑minded standard (arbitrium boni viri) and the non‑automatic inclusion of the audi alteram partem rule. The judgment also referenced case law on the distinction between arbitrators and valuers (Estate Milne v Donohoe Investments, Perdikis v Jamieson) and the principle that a tacit term may be implied where both parties would inevitably have agreed to it at the time of contracting.",
    "application": "The court examined the express wording of clause 16.6 and found nothing excluding the possibility of a tacit term requiring the employee’s input. It noted that the investigation forms contemplated the broker’s involvement, and that the parties, as typical commercial actors, would have expected a hearing before liability was imposed. The court rejected ABSA’s argument that the tacit term, if any, would only apply while the broker remained employed. Consequently, ABSA’s failure to obtain De Lange’s version of events breached the implied term, rendering its decision to hold him liable unreasonable.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed. The High Court’s order was set aside and replaced with an order dismissing claims 4 to 15 against De Lange with costs. The court held that the tacit term requiring a hearing should be implied into clause 16.6, and ABSA’s claims based solely on that clause were therefore untenable."
