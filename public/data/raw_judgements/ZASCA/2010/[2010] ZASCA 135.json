The appeal is allowed\r\nwith costs, including the costs of two counsel.\n2. The order of the court\r\nbelow is set aside and replaced with the following:\n'The appplication is\r\ndismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.'\n________________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\n________________________________________________________________\nBERTELSMANN AJA (Mpati P,\r\nCloete, Lewis and Tshiqi JJA concurring)\n[1] The appellant is the\r\nCommissioner for the South African Revenue Service, appointed in\r\nterms of the\nSouth African Revenue Service Act 34 of 1997\n. He is\r\nresponsible for inter alia the administration of the Customs and\r\nExcise Act 91 of 1964. The respondent is Plasmaview Technologies\n\n(Pty) Ltd (Plasmaview) a company.\n[2] The Commissioner\r\nappeals against a judgment and order of the court below (Prinsloo J\r\nNorth Gauteng High Court Pretoria) which\nreviewed and set aside what\r\nwas said to be a determination, dated 27 July 2006, allegedly made by\r\nhim in the exercise of the powers\nconferred upon him by the Act.\n[3] Plasmaview had\r\nimported fully assembled televisions sets with plasma or liquid\r\ncrystal display (LCD) screens from Korea during\n2006. These sets were\r\ndeclared under tariff heading 8528.21.20 which allowed a full rebate\r\nunder rebate item 460.16.\n[4] Plasmaview relied on\r\na tariff determination dated 20 December 2005 as justification for\r\ndeclaring the television sets in the\nabove manner. The tariff\r\ndetermination was made at a stage when it imported the screens and TV\r\ntuners separately. This determination\nwas referred to as 'Plasma 1'\r\nin the court below and this nomenclature will be retained in this\r\njudgment. The fully assembled TV\nsets were only imported once a copy\r\nof 'Plasma 1' was made available to the respondent.\n[5] On 27 July 2006, the\r\nauthor of that tariff determination, Mr Pool, amended his reasons for\r\nclassifying the screens without tuners\nunder tariff heading\r\n8528.21.20, but did not amend the determination that that tariff\r\nheading applied to the screens in the condition\nhe had considered\r\nthem. He did not inform the respondent of this amendment, which is\r\nreferred to as 'Plasma 2'.\n[6] When the Commissioner\r\ninvestigated the importation of the assembled television sets through\r\nhis Post Clearance Inspection (PCI)\nteam from about May 2006, his\r\nofficials concluded that the fully assembled television sets had been\r\ncleared incorrectly and assessed\nthe respondent by issuing two\r\nschedules in the amounts of R 8 924 191, 69 and R\r\n6 591 987, 90 respectively,\nrepresenting both underpaid\r\nduty and VAT.\n[7] Believing that\r\n'Plasma 2' had formed the basis upon which these assessments were\r\nmade, Plasmaview lodged an appeal against them\nand at the same time\r\nlaunched a review application to have this supposed determination set\r\naside. In the same proceedings, Plasmaview\napplied for a declaratory\r\norder that the amounts assessed were not owing to the appellant.\n[8] The court below\r\naccepted that 'Plasma 2' represented a determination that, in the\r\nabsence of prior notice to Plasmaview, amounted\nto administrative\r\naction that was unfair to it and granted the relief sought. The\r\nCommissioner was ordered to pay costs, including\nthose of senior\r\ncounsel.\n[9] The Commissioner on\r\nappeal disputes the finding that 'Plasma 2' is a determination;\r\nargues that it therefore does not constitute\nadministrative action\r\nand submits that the declaratory order should not have been granted.\r\nThe appeal is with the leave of the\nhigh court.\nThe salient facts\n[10] During 2005, the\r\nrespondent imported eight consignments of LCD screens from Korea into\r\nSouth Africa. The port of entry was\nEast London. The screens were\r\ndescribed by the respondent as computer monitors with 81cm or 94 cm\r\nscreens. They were cleared as\n'input display units for automatic data\r\nprocessing' under tariff heading 8471.60, under which they would not\r\nhave attracted any\ncustoms duty.\n[11] One of the SARS\r\nofficials, Mr Putter, inspected the eight consignments. He found\r\nscreens that were not fitted with TV tuners\non importation, but were\r\nequipped with the tuners very soon after they had been delivered to\r\nthe respondent’s agents in East\nLondon.\n[12] Putter was of the\r\nview that the LCD screens were dutiable. He referred the question of\r\nthe tariff applicable to these items\nto his head office, which\r\ndetermined that the screens were incomplete reception apparatus for\r\ntelevision sets, attracting customs\nand\nad valorem\nduty. They\r\nwere classified under tariff heading 8528.21.30. This classification,\r\nit was common cause, constituted a determination\nin terms of s\r\n47(9)(a)(i)(aa)of the Act ('the LCD determination'). Plasmaview duly\r\namended the tariff heading under which these\nscreens became subject\r\nto duty by submitting correcting vouchers in respect of the eight\r\nconsignments.\n[13] While importing LCD\r\nscreens, Plasmaview also imported 11 consignments of plasma screens.\r\nIts agent requested Pool, a tariff\nspecialist employed at that time\r\nat the Commissioner's head office, to determine the correct tariff\r\napplicable to these screens.\nPool concluded on 20 December 2005 that\r\nthe plasma screens were 'reception apparatus for television' and\r\nought to be cleared under\ntariff heading 8528.21.20.\n[14] This tariff heading\r\nreads:\nHead-ing\nSub-Heading\nCD\nArticle\r\n\t\t\tDescription\nStatistical\nUnit\nRates\r\n\t\t\tof Duty\nReference\nGeneral\nEU\nSADC\n85.28\n8528.2\n8528.21\n.10\n.20\n2\n5\nReception\r\n\t\t\tApparatus for Television, Whether or Not Incorporating\r\n\t\t\tRadio-broadcast Receivers or Sound or Video Recording or\n\n\t\t\tReproducing Apparatus; Video Monitors and Video Projectors:\n*\r\n\t\t\tRefer to General Rebates of Customs Duties and Fuel Levy\n460.16\r\n\t\t\tTemporary Rebates of Customs Duties\n*\r\n\t\t\tRefer to Ad Valorem Excise Duties from Page 691\n▬\nVideo\r\n\t\t\tmonitors:\n=\r\n\t\t\tColour:\nWith\r\n\t\t\t\ta screen size exceeding 3m x 4...........\n-\r\n\t\t\tWith a screen size not exceeding 3 m x 4 m\nu\nu\nfree\n25%\nfree\n22%\nfree\nfree\nA1/1/1273\nw.e.f.\r\n\t\t\t1/1/05\n[15] Pool added that it\r\nwas the view of his office that 'television monitors are video\r\nmonitors' and that 'television receivers\nincorporating screens . . .\r\nqualify as video monitors’. He motivated his determination in\r\npart as follows:\n'CLASSIFICATION:\nTo qualify as a television set, a\r\nvideo monitor must either incorporate a tv tuner or be otherwise\r\ndesigned for completion into\na television set. No evidence of this\r\nnature has been presented by your office. Classification within TH\r\n8528.21.20 cannot be challenged\non the basis of the available\r\ninformation.\nIt should be noted that it is in any\r\nevent the position of this office, in line with the Explanatory Note\r\nto heading 85.28, that\ntelevision monitors are video monitors and\r\nwould qualify for entry under rebate item 460.16, providing that they\r\ncomply with all\nthe other requirements of the rebate item. EN 85.28\r\nreads in pertinent part: \"This heading covers television\r\nreceivers (including\nvideo monitors and video projectors)\" . . .\r\n. The meaning of this syntax could hardly be plainer: included under\r\ntelevision\nreceivers are video monitors and video projectors.\n. . . .\nHOLDING\nTH8528.21.20 applies to the goods at\r\nissue. They are admissible under rebate item 460.16 insofar as they\r\ncomply with all the other\nrequirements of this rebate item.\nTariff Determination\nTariff Code 8528.21.20/460.16\nDetermination\nReception apparatus for television,\r\nwhether or not incorporating radio-broadcast receivers or sound or\r\nvideo recording or reproducing\napparatus; video monitors and video\r\nprojectors: Video monitors: Colour: With a screen size not exceeding\r\n3m x 4m Video monitors:\nProvided that a certificate from the South\r\nAfrican Bureau of Standards is presented at the time of entry that\r\nthe video monitors\nhave more than 600 resolution lines.\nDescription\nPlasma screens (42 inch) not\r\nincorporating tv tuners: PV 4201 S and PV 4201\n. . . .'\n[16] By virtue of this\r\ndetermination, these screens qualified for a full rebate of duty\r\nunder rebate item 460.16. Pool’s advice\nwas sent to the\r\nrespondent’s clearing agents by way of an e-mail on 3 January\r\n2006. Plasmaview then applied to the Controller\nat East London on 5\r\nJanuary 2006 for leave to substitute the bills of entry of the LCD\r\nscreens to reflect tariff heading 8528.21.20\nrather than 8528.21.30,\r\nin order to qualify for the full rebate. This request was granted on\r\n13 March 2006 subject to the payment\nof penalties.\n[17] It must be\r\nemphasised that the plasma screens to which Plasma 1 applied were\r\nimported, as the LCD screens had been up to that\ntime, without TV\r\ntuners. Upon receiving Pool’s determination, Plasmaview\r\narranged with the manufacturer in Korea to fit both\nthe LCD as well\r\nas the plasma screens with TV tuners, so that they were imported as\r\nfully assembled television sets. The assembled\nsets were imported\r\nfrom January 2006. The full rebate was claimed under rebate item\r\n460.16 as before.\n[18] Pool’s view\r\nthat television receivers were screens that without tuners qualified\r\nas video monitors for a full rebate\nwas not uncontroversial and was\r\ndebated with him by his colleagues. On 27 July 2006, Pool amended the\r\n'Law and Evidence' portion\nof 'Plasma 1'. This document is 'Plasma\r\n2'. In essence, Pool changed his stance that television receivers\r\ncould be classified under\ntariff heading 8528.21. This change in his\r\napproach was not communicated to Plasmaview until October 2006.\n[19] The determination\r\nmade on 20 December 2005, identifying the applicable tariff heading\r\nas 8528.21.20 for screens that had not\nbeen equipped with TV tuners,\r\nwas not affected by Pool's amended comments.\n[20] During May 2006,\r\nunaware of Pool’s original determination and unaware of 'Plasma\r\n2', Ms Spies of the SARS PCI in Johannesburg\nbegan an inspection and\r\naudit process into Plasmaview’s imports of television sets and\r\nthe possible underpayment of duty\nand tax in respect thereof. These\r\nimports came to Spies' notice as part of an ongoing investigation\r\ninto imports of television\nsets generally, when the repayment claims\r\nlodged by the respondent with the Controller in East London after\r\nPool’s determination\nwere inspected.\n[21] Suspecting that duty\r\nhad been underpaid, Spies telephoned a Plasmaview representative to\r\ninform her of the inspection and pending\naudit and to request\r\nrelevant documentation from the company. This call was made on 23 May\r\n2006. The discussion was confirmed by\ne-mail the same day. The\r\nrespondent provided the documentation Spies had called for.\n[22] Further literature\r\non the screens was requested in writing on 9 June 2006. Some of it\r\nwas delivered to Spies the next day.\nThe balance was to be supplied\r\nat a personal meeting between Spies and Plasmaview's representatives.\r\nThis meeting was held on 5\nJuly 2006. Spies informed the respondent\r\nof her prima facie\nview that duty had been\r\nunderpaid. Respondent handed a copy of 'Plasma 1' to Spies, placing\r\nreliance upon this document for the\nproposition that complete\r\ntelevision sets could be imported under full rebate of duty.\n[23] On 29 September\r\n2006, after having discussed the respondent’s importation of\r\ntelevision sets with her colleague Lester\nMillar, and having been\r\nprovided with a copy of 'Plasma 2', Spies served a notice of\r\nintention to demand outstanding duties on\nPlasmaview, based upon the\r\nprima facie\nevidence in her possession. This\r\nnotice invited the company to make representations in respect of the\r\nalleged liability for underpaid\nduty. On 2 October 2006, Plasmaview\r\nreacted to Spies' notice by letter, placing reliance on Pool's\r\noriginal determination, Plasma\n1, which was annexed to the letter\r\ntogether with the LCD determination.\n[24] On 5 October 2006,\r\nthe customs supervisor of East London gave notice to Plasmaview of\r\nhis intention to revoke the authorisation\nto present substituted\r\nbills of entry relating to the LCD screens because of the fact that\r\nthe Johannesburg PCI Office had discovered\nthat the imported screens\r\nhad been declared under the incorrect tariff and did not qualify for\r\na rebate. Plasmaview was invited\nto make representations before 3\r\nNovember 2006 why this step should not be taken.\n[25] A meeting on 4\r\nOctober 2006 followed at which the respondent was provided with a\r\ncopy of 'Plasma 2'. On 23 October 2006, Plasmaview,\nthrough its\r\nattorneys, gave formal notice in terms of s 47(9)(e), read with s\r\n96(1)(a)(i) of the Act, of its intention to appeal\nagainst 'the\r\ndetermination' of 27 July 2006, which it had identified as the cause\r\nof the demand for underpaid duties. At the same\ntime, representations\r\nwere made to the Commissioner's Pretoria office in an effort to\r\npersuade the latter to abandon the claim.\n[26] Spies was unaware of\r\nthe submissions made to the Pretoria office. She issued the schedules\r\nreflecting the claim for underpaid\nduties and tax on 9 November 2006\r\nand had them delivered on 13 November 2006.\n[27] Although the\r\nrespondent had delivered its notice of appeal and its representations\r\nto SARS in October 2006, almost a year passed\nbefore the review, the\r\nappeal and the application for a declaratory order were launched in\r\none application. Negotiations between\nthe parties conducted prior to\r\nlitigation had come to naught.\n[28] The court below\r\nupheld the respondent's contention that 'Plasma 2' was a\r\ndetermination, constituted unfair administrative action\nand granted\r\nthe orders referred to above. The commissioner challenges these\r\nfindings and contends that 'Plasma 2' is no determination\nat all, but\r\nmerely an amendment of the motivation that Pool provided in 'Plasma\r\n1'. The Commissioner adopts the stance that the\nclaim for underpaid\r\nduties is not based upon 'Plasma 2' but upon the schedules produced\r\nby the PIC team.\nIs 'plasma 2' a\r\ndetermination?\n[29] A determination for\r\npurposes of Chapter V of the Act is the end result of the\r\nclassification of imported goods under the correct\ntariff heading:\nColgate Palmolive (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner,\r\nSouth African Revenue Service\n2007 (1) SA 35\n(N) para 1;\nCommissioner, South African\r\nRevenue Services v Komatsu Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd\n2007\r\n(2) 157 (SCA) para 8 and the authorities there cited.\n[30] The provisions of\r\nChapter V of the Act were summarized by Cloete JA in\nCommissioner,\r\nSouth African Revenue Service v Trend Finance (Pty) Ltd & another\n2007 (6) SA 117\n(SCA) para 5:\n‘\nChapter V\r\ndeals with clearance of goods and liability for payment of duties.\r\nEvery importer of goods is obliged in terms of s 38(1)\nto make due\r\nentry of those goods in terms of s 39. That latter section requires\r\nthe person entering any imported goods for any\npurpose to deliver a\r\nbill of entry to the controller in the prescribed form; to declare\r\nthat the particulars contained in the bill\nof entry are correct; and\r\nto pay all duties due on the goods. Section 40(1) provides that no\r\nentry shall be valid unless the true\nvalue of the goods on which duty\r\nis leviable or which is required to be declared under the provisions\r\nof the Act, has been declared;\na correct invoice has been produced to\r\nthe controller in the case of goods consigned to any person in the\r\nRepublic; and the correct\nduty has been paid. Section 44(6)(c)\r\nprovides that in all cases except those specifically mentioned, the\r\nliability for duty on\nany imported goods is that of the importer or\r\nowner of such goods (or any person who assumes such liability for any\r\npurpose under\nthe provisions of the Act). Section 44(10) provides\r\nthat any duty for which any person is liable in terms of s 44 shall\r\nbe payable\nupon demand by the Commissioner. Section 47 provides that\r\nduty shall be paid on all imported goods in accordance with the\r\nprovisions\nof Schedule 1.’\n[31] 'Plasma 1'\r\nidentifies, through the accepted process of classification –\r\nsee\nInternational Business Machines SA (Pty)\r\nLtd v Commissioner for Customs and Excise\n1985\r\n(4) SA 852\n(A) at 863F–864C – the heading under which the\r\nimported screens should be classified. 'Plasma 2' differs from\r\n'Plasma\n1' only in respect of the amended comment prepared by Pool\r\nunder the heading 'Law and Analysis', in which he suggests that a\r\nplasma\nscreen or a LCD screen incorporating a TV tuner could '…\r\nnever be regarded as a video monitor', and could not qualify for\na\r\nrebate under item 460.16. The tariff determination made in respect of\r\nthe screens (without tuners) in December 2005 was expressly\nnot\r\naltered by the amended comment. The date of the original\r\ndetermination was not affected and the document specifies that it\n\n(still) applies to plasma screens not incorporating TV tuners.\n[32] 'Plasma 2' is\r\ntherefore no tariff determination. Once this fact is established, it\r\nis clear that the claim for underpaid duties\ndoes not, and could not,\r\narise from the amended comment prepared by Mr Pool.\nThe review of 'Plasma\r\n2'\n[33] As 'Plasma 2' is not\r\na determination, it is not a decision capable of being reviewed, nor\r\ncan an appeal be lodged in terms\nof s 47(9)(e) against its contents.\r\nThe court below\nerred in this regard. Counsel for\r\nthe respondent was constrained to concede during argument that the\r\nhigh court's findings could\nnot be supported.\nThe importation of\r\ncomplete TV sets\n[34] 'Plasma 1' was\r\nprepared at a stage at which the respondent imported screens without\r\nTV tuners, with specific reference to plasma\nscreens. Section\r\n47(9)(a)(iii) of the Act reads:\n'Any determination made under this\r\nsubsection shall operate –\n(aa) only in respect of the goods\r\nmentioned therein and the person in whose name it is issued…'\n[35] It is common cause,\r\nas I have said, that the respondent, once it received 'Plasma 1',\r\nimported both LCD and plasma screens\nwith TV tuners already fitted by\r\nthe Korean manufacturer. It therefore began to import complete TV\r\nsets.\n[36] While screens\r\nimported without tuners were at the time correctly classified under\r\ntariff heading 8528.21.20, qualifying for\na full rebate under rebate\r\nitem 460.16 – see\nCSARS v LG Electronics\n(428/09)\n[2010] ZASCA 79\n(28 May 2010) –\r\nthe determination fell away once the nature of the imported item\r\nchanged. Not only did 'Plasma 2' therefore\nnot amend the earlier\r\ndetermination, it simply did not apply any longer to the respondent’s\r\nimports once the tuners were\nfitted prior to shipment of the sets to\r\nSouth Africa. This fact was overlooked in the judgment appealed\r\nagainst.\nThe schedules prepared\r\nby the PIC\n[37] Ms Spies prepared\r\ntwo schedules relating to bills of entry submitted by the respondent\r\nin respect of the screens imported during\n2005 and 2006. The\r\nschedules were prepared in the exercise of the powers granted to the\r\nappellant by section 47(9)(a) and 47(11):\n'(9) (a) (i) The Commissioner may in\r\nwriting determine-\n(aa) the tariff headings, tariff\r\nsubheadings or tariff items or other items of any Schedule under\r\nwhich any imported goods, goods\nmanufactured in the Republic or goods\r\nexported shall be classified; or ….\n(11) (a) Notwithstanding the\r\nprovisions of subsection (10), any determination made under\r\nsubsection (9) (a) as a result of or during\nthe course of or\r\nfollowing upon an inspection of the books, accounts and other\r\ndocuments of an importer, exporter, manufacturer\nor user of goods,\r\nshall, subject to the provisions of section 44(11)(c), be deemed to\r\nhave come into operation in respect of the\ngoods in question entered\r\nfor the purposes of this Act two years prior to the date on which the\r\ninspection commenced.\n(b) The expression \"inspection of\r\nany books, accounts and other documents\", or any other reference\r\nto an inspection in\nthis Act shall be taken to include any act done\r\nby an officer in the exercise of any duty imposed or power conferred\r\nby this Act\nfor the purposes of the physical examination of goods and\r\ndocuments upon or after or in the absence of entry, the issue of stop\n\nnotes or other reports, the making of assessments and any pre- or\r\npost-importation audit, investigation, inspection or verification\nof\r\nany such books, accounts and other documents required to be kept\r\nunder this Act.'\n[38] The schedules\r\nprepared by Spies are determinations as intended in the Act.\nAlternative relief\n[39] Once it was clear\r\nthat the appeal had to succeed, respondent’s counsel sought to\r\nrely on alternative relief envisaged\nduring the hearing before the\r\ncourt below when Plasmaview was granted an amendment of the notice of\r\nmotion. Prayer 5 was amended\nto include the words 'Annexures FA 17\r\nand FA 18 [Spies' schedules] are hereby set aside and'\nbefore\r\nthe original prayer 'it is declared that the amounts demanded by the\r\nrespondent [the present appellant] from the applicant\n[the present\r\nrespondent] in Annexures “FA 17” and “FA 18”\r\nto the founding affidavit, being respectively\nR8 924 191,69 (together\r\nwith interest thereon) and R 6 591 987,90 (together with interest\r\nthereon), are not owing by the applicant\nto the respondent.' Although\r\nthe amendment was granted\n'provisionally',\nthe court below couched its declaratory order in the\r\nform in which it was worded originally.\n[40] The Commissioner’s\r\nreliance on the schedules was introduced into the court below by an\r\nadditional affidavit filed without\nopposition. Although Plasmaview\r\ndid file a further affidavit in reply to the additional affidavit,\r\nthe schedules were not dealt\nwith at all.\n[41] Faced with these\r\ndifficulties, Plasmaview's counsel requested the indulgence of a\r\npostponement in order to supplement the papers\nto enable it to deal\r\nwith the schedules. The Commissioner objected. The schedules were not\r\ndisputed in the court below, either\nin respect of the correctness of\r\nthe calculations of duty and tax, or in respect of the validity of\r\nthe decision to prepare them.\nThere is no explanation before this\r\ncourt why, if these aspects were in issue, the dispute was not\r\nventilated before and why available\nevidence was not placed on\r\nrecord. There is consequently no basis upon which a postponement\r\ncould be granted.\n[42] Finally, Plasmaview\r\nargued that the commissioner does have a discretion whether or not to\r\napply the provisions of s 47(11)\nonce an underpayment of duty is\r\nestablished. It sought a postponement for the purpose of making\r\nrepresentations to the appellant\nto persuade him not to exercise the\r\npowers given to him in terms of this section. Again, the Commissioner\r\nopposed the request.\n[43] From the wording of\r\nthe section quoted above it would appear prima facie that the\r\nappellant has no discretion that would allow\nhim not to apply its\r\nprovisions. No postponement could alter this fact. But even if the\r\nappellant could exercise a discretion not\nto apply s 47(11), this\r\nissue was not raised in the court below. There is no basis upon which\r\nthe appeal could be postponed to\naccommodate a request to make\r\nfurther representations at this stage. The remarks by Schutz JA in\nMcCarthy Retail Ltd v Short Distance Carriers\r\nCC\n2001 (3) SA 482\n(SCA) paras 27 to 33 are\r\napplicable in this case. The postponement was sought at the last\r\nmoment after the appeal had been conceded;\nno satisfactory reasons\r\nwere advanced for the lateness of the hour at which it was sought;\r\nand the Commissioner has a right to\nhave the appeal disposed of. The\r\nprincipal reason for refusing the postponement is the fact that it\r\nwas sought in order to allow\nthe respondent to create a cause of\r\naction where none existed when the appeal was heard. The request for\r\na postponement could therefore\nnot be entertained.\n[44] 1. The appeal is\r\nallowed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.\n2. The order of the court\r\nbelow is set aside and replaced with the following:\n'The application is\r\ndismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.'\n___________________\nE BERTELSMANN\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor appellant: C Puckrin\r\nSC\nT Khatri\nInstructed\r\nby:\nThe State Attorney,\r\nPretoria\nThe State Attorney,\r\nBloemfontein\nFor\r\nrespondent: J P Vorster SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nWolvaardt Inc, Pretoria\nMatsepes Inc,\r\nBloemfontein",

    "facts": "Plasmaview Technologies imported fully assembled television sets with plasma or LCD screens from Korea in 2006. The sets were initially classified under tariff heading 8528.21.20 based on a tariff determination dated 20 December 2005 (referred to as 'Plasma 1'), which allowed a full customs duty rebate under item 460.16. After the imports began, the tariff specialist Mr Pool amended the explanatory comments of his earlier determination on 27 July 2006 (referred to as 'Plasma 2'), stating that screens with TV tuners could not be regarded as video monitors and would not qualify for the rebate. The Commissioner’s Post Clearance Inspection team later assessed Plasmaview for under‑payment of duty and VAT, issuing two schedules totaling roughly R15.5 million. Plasmaview appealed the assessments and sought a declaratory order that the amounts were not payable, arguing that 'Plasma 2' was an administrative determination that had been applied unfairly.",
    "issues": "The primary issues were (1) whether the amendment known as 'Plasma 2' constitutes a tariff determination within the meaning of Chapter V of the Customs and Excise Act and therefore a form of administrative action subject to review; (2) whether the Commissioner’s claim for under‑paid duties could be based on the schedules prepared under s 47(9)(a) and s 47(11) rather than on 'Plasma 2'; and (3) whether the lower court erred in setting aside the Commissioner’s order and granting the declaratory relief sought by Plasmaview.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the definition of a \"determination\" as the final classification of imported goods under the correct tariff heading, relying on precedents such as Colgate Palmolive v Commissioner and Komatsu Southern Africa v Commissioner. Sections 47(9)(a) and 47(11) of the Act were identified as conferring the power to make tariff determinations and to deem them operative retrospectively. The Court clarified that a mere amendment of explanatory comments (as in 'Plasma 2') does not alter the original determination and therefore does not create a new decision capable of review. Unfair administrative action requires a determinate decision, which was absent in this case.",
    "application": "The Court found that 'Plasma 2' was only an amendment to the reasoning behind the original 'Plasma 1' determination and did not change the tariff classification of the goods at the time of import. Consequently, it was not a tariff determination and could not be the basis of a review or a declaratory order. The schedules prepared by the PCI officer, however, were true determinations made under s 47(9)(a) and s 47(11) and formed the proper basis for the Commissioner’s claim for under‑paid duty and VAT. The lower court’s finding that 'Plasma 2' was unfair administrative action was therefore erroneous.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed with costs, including the costs of two counsel. The order of the North Gauteng High Court was set aside and replaced with a dismissal of the application, also with costs. The Commissioner’s assessment of under‑paid duties stands, and Plasmaview’s claim for a declaratory order was rejected."
