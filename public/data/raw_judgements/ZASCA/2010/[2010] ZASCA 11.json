The Commissioner\nassessed Defy for STC in the sum of\nR28 811 074 for the dividend cycle 16 May 2004 to 27\nJanuary 2005. Defy objected to\nthe assessment but the Commissioner\ndisallowed the objection. An appeal to the tax court (Murphy J and\nMessrs Crafford-Lazarus and\nMatlala) failed and thus the present\nappeal.\n[2]\tSTC is a tax on dividends\ndeclared by resident companies. It is imposed by s 64B (forming\npart of Part VII) of the Income\nTax Act 58 of 1962. It is as well to\nset out the material provisions of that section and to outline their\ngeneral effect before turning\nto their application to the facts of\nthis case.\n[3]\tPart VII was introduced into\nthe Act in 1993\n1\nand has since been amended from time to time. At the time that is\nmaterial to this appeal s 64B took the following form (omitting\nprovisions that are not now relevant):\nâ\n(2)\tThere shall\nbe levied and paid for the benefit of the National Revenue Fund a\ntax, to be known as the secondary tax on companies,\nwhich is\ncalculated at the rate of 12,5 per cent of the net amount, as\ndetermined in terms of subsection (3), of any dividend declared\non or\nafter 14 March 1996 by any company which is a resident.\n(3)\tSubject to\nsubsection (3A), the net amount of any dividend referred to in\nsubsection (2) shall be the amount by which such dividend\ndeclared by\na company exceeds the sum of any dividends which have accrued to that\ncompany during the dividend cycle in relation to\nsuch firstmentioned\ndividend: Provided that â\n(a)\tâ¦\n(b)\tin the\ndetermination of the net amount of any dividend distributed in the\ncourse or in anticipation of the liquidation or winding\nup or\nderegistration of a company, there shall be allowed as a deduction\nany dividend contemplated in subsection (5)(c) which has\nduring the\ncurrent or any previous dividend cycle accrued to the company.\n(3A)\n2\nIn\ndetermining the sum of the dividends which have accrued to a company\nas contemplated in subsection (3), no regard must be had\nto â\nany dividend\n\tcontemplated in subsection (5)(b), (c) or (f).\nâ\n(d) â¦\n(4)\tâ¦\n(5)\tThere shall be\nexempt from the secondary tax on companies â\n(a) â (b) â¦\n(c)\tso much of any\ndividend distributed in the course or in anticipation of the\nliquidation or winding up or deregistration of a\ncompany, as is shown\nby the company to be a â\n(i)\tâ¦\n(ii)\tdistribution of\nprofits of a capital nature (other than capital profits attributable\nto the disposal of any asset on or after\n1 October 2001 which capital\nprofits must, in the case of an asset acquired before that date, be\nlimited to the amount of profit\ndetermined as if that asset had been\nacquired on 1 October 2001 for a cost equal to the market value of\nthat asset on that date determined\nin the manner contemplated in\nparagraph 29 of the Eighth Schedule): â¦\n(iii)\tâ¦\nâ\n(e)  â¦\nany dividend\n\tdeclared by a company which accrues to a shareholder (as defined in\n\tPart III) of that company if â\n(i) - (iv) â¦\n(v)\tthe company\ndeclaring the dividend elects the exemption under this paragraph to\napply â¦â\n[4]\tThe word âdividendâ is\ngenerally used to describe a distribution of profits to shareholders\nbut it has an extended meaning\nfor purposes of the Act. The\ndefinition in the Act is lengthy and complex. It is sufficient for\npresent purposes to say that it means,\nsubject to its various\nqualifications, âany amount distributed by a company to its\nshareholdersâ. One of the qualifications is\nthat it does not\ninclude (subject to provisos that are not material) money that is\ngiven by a company to its shareholders âto the\nextent that [it]\nrepresents a reduction of the ... share premium account of a\ncompanyâ.\n3\n[5]\tIt is important to bear in\nmind that STC is a withholding tax. The tax is levied upon a declared\ndividend and the burden of the\ntax will naturally be borne by the\nrecipient of the dividend. The company merely withholds the tax at\nits source and pays it to the\nCommissioner.\n[6]\tOnce a dividend has been\ntaxed, and the remaining amount of the dividend has been paid to a\ncompany shareholder, the recipient\ncompany may wish to pass the\nbenefit of the dividend to its own shareholders. It will do so by\ndeclaring a dividend of its own in\nthe amount of the moneys that it\nreceived. If that dividend were itself to be taxed then the\nbeneficiary of the original dividend\n(the recipient of the second\ndividend) would be burdened by double taxation.\n[7]\tTo avoid that occurring, STC\nis levied on only the ânet amountâ of a dividend that is\ndeclared. Under subsection (3) (leaving\naside for the moment the\nqualification in subsection (3A)) the ânet amountâ of a declared\ndividend is the amount of the dividend\n(the outgoing dividend) less\nthe sum of all dividends that have accrued to the company (the\nincoming dividends) during the same dividend\ncycle.\n[8]\tThus if a company pays R100\nto its holding company in settlement of a declared dividend (after\nwithholding STC), and the holding\ncompany distributes that income to\nits own shareholders by declaring a dividend of R100, the ânet\namountâ of the holding companyâs\ndividend will be nil. The\nultimate beneficiary of the original dividend will bear the burden\nonly of the tax that was withheld at\nits source.\n[9]\tSubsection (5) exempts\ncertain dividends from STC. The effect of the various exemptions will\ndiffer according to their purpose.\nI confine myself in this judgment\nto the exemption under subsection (5)(c)(ii).\n[10]\tA dividend qualifies for\nexemption under subsection 5(c)(ii) if it is distributed â\nin\nthe course or in anticipation of the liquidation or winding up or\nderegistration of a companyâ and if it is shown by the company\nto\nbe a âdistribution of profits of a capital natureâ (subject to a\nqualification that is not directly material\n4\n).\n[11]\tI deal later in this\njudgment with what is meant by âprofits of a capital natureâ. For\nthe moment I deal with the effect\nthat is brought about by exempting\na profit of that kind. (For convenience I will abbreviate the phrase\nâprofit of a capital natureâ\nto âcapital profitâ.)\n[12]\tIf a shareholder (assuming\nit to be a company) were to receive a dividend that has been exempted\nfrom STC, and it were to pass\nthe benefit of that dividend to its own\nshareholder, then on the ordinary application of the mechanism of\nsubsection (3), that shareholder\nwould enjoy the benefit of the\ndividend free from tax. The qualification in subsection (3) prevents\nthat occurring by bringing subsection\n(3A) into play. That subsection\nprovides that âno regard must be hadâ to a dividend that was\nexempt under subsection (5)(c) when\nâdetermining the sum of the\n[incoming] dividends which have accrued to a companyâ for the\npurpose of calculating the ânet amountâ\nof its dividend.\n[13]\tThus if a capital profit of\nR100 is distributed by a company in anticipation of its winding up it\nwill be exempt from tax. But\nif the recipient company were to\ndistribute that receipt (and no more) to its own shareholder by\ndeclaring a dividend of R100, the\nânet amountâ of its dividend\nwill be R100 (the dividend, less incoming dividends, but leaving out\nof account the exempt incoming\ndividend) and will attract tax. The\neffect is to allow a subsidiary to distribute its capital profits to\nits holding company in anticipation\nof its winding up, but to levy\nthe tax on a further distribution of the money by the holding\ncompany.\n[14]\t However, a holding company\nthat has received such a capital profit from its subsidiary might\nitself be wound up. Naturally,\nany moneys that are earned by it as a\ncapital profit in anticipation of its winding up may be distributed\nto its shareholder free\nof tax (because it is exempt under subsection\n5(c)(ii)). But the proviso to subsection (3)(b) enables it also to\npass on to its shareholder\nthe benefit of the capital profit that was\nmade by the subsidiary. It does so by allowing the holding company to\ndeduct the dividend\nreceived from the subsidiary from the ânet\namountâ of the dividend that the holding company declares.\n[15]\tThus, if the subsidiary has\nearned and distributed to its holding company a capital profit of\nR100 (free of tax), and the holding\ncompany has itself earned a\nseparate capital profit of R200 in anticipation of its winding up,\nand it distributes all those moneys\n(and no more) to its shareholder,\nthe net amount of its R300 dividend will be nil,\n5\nand the dividend will be received by the shareholder free of tax. If\nthat shareholder were to distribute those moneys further by\ndeclaring\nits own dividend then that dividend will attract the tax.\n[16]\tI think the examples\ndemonstrate that, when a series of companies in a hierarchy are to be\nwound up, the exemption and its related\nprovisions operate to enable\nthe ultimate shareholder in the series to receive, free of tax, the\ncapital profits made by all of them\nin anticipation of their winding\nup. But any further distribution of the moneys is treated as a\ntaxable dividend and will be taxed\nupon that distribution occurring.\n[17]\tIn this case we are\nconcerned with a subsidiary and a holding company that have both made\ndistributions in anticipation of their\nwinding up, which is the\nexample in paragraph 15 above.\n[18]\tIt will be apparent from\nthat example that if the capital profit of R100 that was earned by\nthe subsidiary and distributed to\nthe holding company is, upon\nreceipt by the holding company, equally a capital profit earned by\nthe holding company (assuming that\nis capable of occurring), then\nupon distribution of that R100 by the holding company (without more)\nthe ânet amountâ of its dividend\nwill be minus R100.\n6\nThe shareholder will thus receive the dividend not only free of tax,\nbut together with what I might call a âtax creditâ.\n[19]\tIf that is the only\ndistribution that the shareholder receives then the existence of the\nâtax creditâ will not be significant.\nBut if the holding company\nwere simultaneously to distribute a taxable amount of R100 then the\nshareholder will receive both portions\nof the dividend free of tax.\nIn effect, the tax that is payable on the taxable portion will be set\noff against what I have called\nthe âtax creditâ.\n[20]\tIt would be curious indeed\nif a shareholder who receives R100 that is taxable were to be\nrelieved of that tax on account of simultaneously\nreceiving R100 that\nis not taxable. Needless to say, that will occur only if the capital\nprofit that it receives from the subsidiary\nwere equally to be a\ncapital profit earned by the holding company. The Commissioner says\nthat is not possible. Defy says that it\nis possible, and that it has\noccurred in this case. The tax court agreed with Defy (but\nnonetheless found for the Commissioner, which\nis another curiosity in\nthis case).\n[21]\tThat is what this case is\nabout. Defy received from its subsidiary a distribution, in\nanticipation of the winding up of its subsidiary,\namounting to\nR343 811 457 (excluding an amount that it received in\nrepayment of a loan). Included in that amount was R206 080 509\nthat was earned by the subsidiary as a capital profit. Defy\ndistributed that sum of R343 811 457 to its shareholders,\ntogether\nwith other money that was taxable. It says that the R343 811\n457 that it received from its subsidiary, after deduction of the\ncost\nof acquiring the subsidiary, was a capital profit that it earned (and\nthus exempt from tax\n7\n).\nIf that is so then, naturally, the deduction from that amount, under\nsubsection (3)(b), of the capital profit that it received\nfrom its\nsubsidiary yields a negative sum of R206 080 509, and that\nproduces what I have called a âtax creditâ. That\nâtax creditâ\nsets off the tax that is payable on the taxable moneys that were\ndistributed, and that is why no tax is payable\non the dividend.\n[22]\tIf that sounds internally\ncontradictory it is nonetheless the case that is advanced by Defy.\nBut let me say immediately that\nI do not suggest that Defy has acted\nimproperly in any way. It says that if the statute, upon its proper\nconstruction, has that effect,\nthen the Commissioner can have no\nproper cause for complaint, and that must be correct. The question in\nthis case is whether it has\nproperly construed the statute.\n[23]\tThe dispute arises from a\ndecision by the shareholders of Defy to dispose of its business to\nClidet No 553 (Pty) Ltd and then\nto wind up the company. Defy was an\ninvestment company. Its assets comprised all the shares in a number\nof subsidiaries and it can\nbe accepted that those shares were capital\nassets. One of the subsidiaries was Defy Appliances (Pty) Ltd, which\nwas the main operating\ncompany in the group. (I will refer to that\ncompany as Appliances.) The identity of the other subsidiaries is not\nmaterial.\n[24]\tThe objective of winding up\nDefy might ordinarily have been achieved by causing Defy to sell to\nClidet the shares in all the\nsubsidiaries and to distribute the\nproceeds of the sale to the shareholders, and then winding up the\nremaining shell. Indeed, that\nwas the approach that was adopted in\nrelation to the subsidiaries other than Appliances.\n8\nBut so far as Appliances was concerned the shareholders chose instead\nthat Appliances should sell the whole of its business to Clidet\nas a\ngoing concern, that Appliances should then distribute the proceeds to\nDefy (after paying liabilities), leaving Appliances as\na shell. Upon\nreceipt of the proceeds Defy would in turn distribute them to its\nshareholders and Defy would be wound up (presumably\nafter dissolving\nAppliances).\n[25]\tTo achieve those objectives\nan indivisible agreement of sale was concluded between the relevant\nparties. In terms of that agreement\nDefy sold to Clidet all its\nshares in the subsidiaries other than Appliances for R550 298 138,\nand Appliances sold to Clidet\nthe whole of its business as a going\nconcern. After settling its liabilities Appliances then paid to Defy\nthe balance of the proceeds\nof the sale of its business amounting to\nR426 152 780 thereby denuding itself of all its assets.\n[26]\tOf that amount R82 341 323\nwas paid in settlement of Defyâs loan account, R68 811 457\nwas paid in reduction\nof Applianceâs share premium account, and the\nbalance was a distribution to Defy of profits made by Appliances â\nrevenue profits\nof R68 919 490 and capital profits of\nR206 080 510.\n[27]\tIt is not in dispute that\nthe distribution by Appliances, which was made in anticipation of its\nwinding up, did not attract STC.\nOf the moneys that were paid by\nAppliances to Defy R82 341 was the repayment of a loan (which is\nnot a dividend), R68 811 457\nwas paid in reduction of its\nshare premium account (which is not a dividend), the revenue profit\nof R68 919 490 was exempt\nfrom STC under subsection 5(f)\n(why that was so is not material), and the capital profit of\nR206 080 510 was exempt\nfrom STC under subsection 5(c)(ii).\n[28]\tDefy then distributed to its\nshareholders the sum of R498 000 000 as a dividend. The\nCommissioner takes the view that\nR230 488 595 of that\ndividend was subject to STC and he assessed Defy for tax on that\namount in the sum of R28 811 074.\n[29]\tThe Commissioner accepts\nthat the sale by Defy of its shares in the subsidiaries yielded an\nexempt capital profit of R61 430 895.\nHe also accepts that\nthe amount of R206 080 510 that was exempt from STC when\ndistributed by Appliances is deductible from\nthe dividend under\nsubsection (3)(b). Thus his calculation of the ânet amountâ of\nthe dividend can be tabulated as follows:\nDistribution\tR498 000 000\nCapital profit on sale of shares\nexempt under subsection\n(5)(c)(ii)\t(\n61 430 895)\nTaxable Dividend\tR436 569 105\nIncoming exempt dividend\ndeductable\nunder subsection\n(3)(b)\t(\n206 080 510)\nNet Amount of\nDividend\tR230 488 595\n[30]\tDefy naturally agrees with\nthe Commissioner that its profit on the sale of the subsidiaries is\nexempt under subsection (5)(c)(ii)\nthough initially it calculated the\nprofit to be R59 824 897. The difference between Defy and\nthe Commissioner on that score\nis not significant. Defy accepts the\nfigure calculated by Commissioner. In what follows I will nonetheless\nuse Defyâs figure of\nR59 824 897 to avoid introducing\nconfusion. Defy and the Commissioner are also at one that the exempt\ndividend received\nfrom Appliances (R206 080 510) is\ndeductible under subsection (3)(b). But Defy says that R305 311 541\n9\nof its dividend was a distribution of a capital profit that it earned\nand is therefore exempt from tax under subsection (5)(c)(ii).\nThus it\ntabulates the calculation of the ânet amountâ of its dividend as\nfollows (I have simplified the language that it used):\nDistribution\tR498 000 000\nCapital profit on sale of shares\nexempt under subsection\n(5)(c)(ii)\t(59 824 897)\nCapital profit on investment in\nAppliances\nexempt under Subsection\n(5)(c)(ii)\n(305 311 541)\nTaxable Dividend \tR132 863 562\nIncoming exempt dividend\ndeductable\nunder subsection\n(3)(b)\t(\n206 080 510)\nNet Amount (negative)\t(R73 216\n948)\n[31]\tThe various tabulations that\nhave been presented by or on behalf of Defy from time to time reflect\nthe ânet amountâ of its\ndividend to be nil. No doubt that was\nbecause only R132 863 562 of the deduction has practical\nsignificance for the purpose\nof calculating STC. But I have presented\nthe true outcome to illustrate the point that I made earlier, which\nis that the effect of\nboth exempting its distribution of R206 080 590\nand deducting the equivalent amount that was received from\nAppliances,\nresults in what I have called a âtax creditâ. Portion\nof the âtax creditâ offsets the tax that would ordinary have been\npayable\non the taxable portion of the dividend.\n[32]\tIn its grounds of appeal to\nthe tax court Defy tabulated the calculation of its alleged capital\nprofit as follows (once more\nI have simplified the language):\nDividend received from\nAppliances\tR275 000 000\nShare Premium received from\nAppliances\n68 811 457\nTotal Distribution from\nAppliances\tR343 811 457\nLess: Original cost of [Defyâs]\ninvestment\nin Appliances\n(28 451 459)\nTotal Capital Profit Realised by\nDefy\tR315 359 998\nIt went on to attribute the\nearning of that profit to the periods before and after 1 October 2001\n(as envisaged by the qualification\nin subsection v(5)(c)(ii))\nand attributed R305 311 541 to the latter period. We need\nnot concern ourselves with that\npart of its calculation. The real\ndispute is whether it earned a capital profit of R315 359 998\nin the first place.\n[33]\tIt will be seen that the\ncase advanced by Defy is relatively straightforward. Put simply, Defy\nsays that it paid R28 451 459\nto acquire the shares of\nAppliances, and has received R343 811 457 in return, thus\nit has profited on its capital investment\nin the amount of\nR315 359 998.\n[34]\tIt might indeed be said, in\ngeneral terms, that Defy has profited on its investment, but that is\nnot what we are concerned with\nin this case. Moneys are not exempt\nfrom STC merely because an arithmetic profit was made by the company\nin an equivalent amount.\nThe subsection identifies money that is\nexempt from STC with reference to the character of the moneys\nconcerned. The moneys are exempt\nfrom tax if they have been yielded\nto the company as a capital profit, and it is as well to have clarity\non what that means.\n[35]\tThe word âprofitâ is\ncapable of being used in various ways to describe a gain, or\nadvantage, or benefit of some kind,\n10\nwhich is how Defy uses it. But like all language that is used in a\nstatute, it must be construed in its particular context. Subsection\n(5)(c)(ii) is concerned with companies that divest themselves of\ntheir residual assets in preparation for the dissolution of the\ncompany. They do that by converting the assets into cash (or other\ndistributable form), so far as that is necessary, and then\ndistributing\nthe cash to their shareholders. In that context I think\nit is clear that the word âprofitâ has meaning 5. assigned to it\nby the\nShorter Oxford Dictionary â âthe pecuniary gain in any\ntransactionâ â and that the transactions to which it relates are\nthe\ndisposal of assets. It goes without saying that the profit so\nearned will be âof a capital natureâ if the asset that yielded\nthe profit was a capital asset.\n11\nIn short, the subsection exempts from taxation the pecuniary gain\nthat is earned upon disposal by the company of a capital asset.\n[36]\tWhile offering no\nalternative meaning of the phrase counsel for Defy nonetheless\nsubmitted that the disposal by the company of\nan asset is not a\nprerequisite for the earning of a capital profit. In support of that\nconstruction much was made in the heads of\nargument of the reference\nto the âdisposal of any assetâ in the parenthesised qualification\nin subsection (5)(c)(ii) (the\nqualification relating to the\ndisposal of assets after 1 October 2001) in contradistinction to the\nabsence of any such reference\nin the preceding words. The argument,\nas I understand it, was that the inference to be drawn from the\nabsence of a reference to assets\nin those preceding words is that the\nsubsection contemplates that a âprofit of a capital natureâ might\nbe earned without disposing\nof assets. It is only if assets are\ndisposed of, so the argument went, that the qualification comes into\nplay.\n[37]\tI do not think that\ninference is warranted. The qualification describes the basis upon\nwhich a capital profit is to be attributed\nto the periods before and\nafter 1 October 2001. The basis that has been chosen for that\nattribution could not have been described\nwithout reference to the\nassets that yielded the profit. And if a capital profit is, by\ndefinition, yielded only by the disposal\nof an asset, then a\nreference to the disposal of assets in the language that precedes the\nqualification would be superfluous.\n[38]\tFar from supporting Defy,\nthe qualification seems to me to operate against it. For if a capital\nprofit as envisaged by the subsection\nis capable of being earned\nwithout disposing of an asset, then I think it is remarkable that the\ndrafter did not provide for how\nthe profit was to be attributed if it\nwas earned over a period before and after 1 October 2001, bearing in\nmind the purpose of the\nqualification.\n[39]\tWe were also referred to\nBailey v Commissioner\nfor Inland Revenue\n,\n12\nNew Mines Limited v\nCommissioner for Inland Revenue\n,\n13\nand\nIncome Tax Case No.\n101,\n14\nwhich were said to support the proposition that a profit of a capital\nnature might be earned other than by the disposal of an asset.\nThe\ncourts were concerned in those cases with the question whether the\nmoneys concerned were revenue\nâ\nand not profits\nâ\nof a capital nature, for purposes of normal income tax. In the\npresent context those words are not interchangeable, though they were\ntreated as such in some of the submissions that were made before us.\nWe are not concerned with whether the moneys that were received\nby\nDefy constitute revenue of a capital nature for purposes of normal\nincome tax. We are concerned with whether they were earned\nas a\ncapital profit for purposes of STC.\n[40]\tI have already said that\ncounsel for Defy offered no alternative meaning of the phrase. Nor\nwas he able to proffer an example\nof a capital profit that is earned\nother than by the disposal of a capital asset (leaving out of account\nthis case). In my view that\nis because there is none. I think it is\nclear that the term is used in the subsection to mean, as I expressed\nit earlier, the pecuniary\ngain from the disposal of a capital asset\n(the proceeds after deduction of the cost of acquiring the capital\nasset).\n[41]\tIn this case the money was\nnot a gain from the disposal by Defy of an asset. Defy retained the\nshares that it held in Appliances.\nThe court below said that Defy\nâ\nrealised the value in\nthe shares by selling the business as a going concernâ and that âas\nsuch the profits from the realization\nof that value were profits of a\ncapital natureâ. It was, of course,\nAppliances,\nand not Defy, that sold the business, but that is by the way. So far\nis it was suggested that Defy disposed of the âvalueâ\nof its\nasset that is not correct. The âvalueâ of an asset is not\nproperty that is capable of being bought and sold. It is an\nattribute\nthat is inherent in the asset. Its value might rise or fall,\ndepending upon the market for the asset, and its value might\neven be\nnil if the asset has no market at all, but an asset and its value are\ninseparable. It is true that the money compensated\nfor the fall in\nvalue of the shares but that is another matter.\n[42]\tNo doubt it was because Defy\ncould not be said to have earned a profit, in the proper sense of the\nword, that the moneys were\ndescribed variously by counsel for Defy,\nand by the court below, as having the âeffectâ of a capital\nprofit, or âamounting\ntoâ a capital profit. The court below said\nthat the approach taken by the Commissioner was âtoo formalisticâ.\nIt said that\nthere was âin effect a disposal of the assets\nunderpinning the value of the sharesâ and âthere was in substance\na disposal\nof the sharesâ. But none of that is good enough. The\nsubsection exempts moneys that are a capital profit. It does not\nexempt, in\naddition, moneys that are not a capital profit, but have\nthe effect of being one.\n[43]\tThose attempts to liken the\nmoneys to a profit seem to me only to draw attention to an\ninsurmountable hurdle for Defy. I have\npointed out that the\nsubsection identifies money that is exempt from taxation with\nreference to the character of the money, and that\nis determined by\nthe nature of the transaction that yielded it. The subsection does\nnot have one meaning on one occasion and a different\nmeaning on\nanother occasion. Moneys cannot be exempt when received by one\ncompany, and also exempt when received by another company,\nunless the\nnature of the transaction that yielded it on each occasion is the\nsame. The insurmountable difficulty for Defy is that\nit received its\nmoney in payment of a dividend, and Appliances did not. It follows\ninexorably that the moneys received by each cannot\nboth be exempt.\n[44]\tThe moneys earned by\nAppliances were exempt because they were the gain that was yielded\nfrom the disposal of capital assets.\nThe moneys received by Defy were\nnot yielded in the same way. Defy received its moneys in extinction\nof its claim to be paid a declared\ndividend in an equivalent amount.\nIt might be said that the claim was an asset that was disposed of in\nreturn for the money but Defy\nmade no gain on the exchange and the\nclaim was in any event not a capital asset.\n[45]\tThere is a matter that I\nneed deal with only briefly before I conclude. The court below found\nthat the money received by Defy\nas a distribution of the revenue and\ncapital profits of Appliances, after deduction of the cost of the\ninvestment, had the effect\nof being a capital profit and was\ntherefore exempt. (It found that the money received in reduction of\nthe share premium was not.)\nOne might have thought that in those\ncircumstances it would have found against the Commissioner. But it\nwas concerned at the result\nthat its conclusions had led it to, which\nwas what it called âdouble favourable treatmentâ of the\nexemption. The grounds upon\nwhich it found for the Commissioner\ninstead were expressed as follows (in para 41):\nâ\nThe problem of\ndouble favourable treatment was not adequately canvassed by counsel\nfor the Commissioner during argument, even though\nwe invited\nsubmission on the question. To us the matter is of critical\nimportance. It strikes us that the provisions of section 64B\nread\ncontextually and purposively as a whole disclose a policy consistent\nwith the Commissionerâs submission that double favourable\ntreatment\nof the same amount is intended only to the limited extent of a\ndeduction as opposed to a second exemption, whenever the\nholding\ncompany that has received an exempt liquidation dividend in turn\nchooses to go into liquidation.â\n[46]\tI have some difficulty with\nthe idea that a construction of the parts of a statute can produce\none result but a construction\nof the sum of its parts can produce\nanother. It needs to be born in mind that a statute is not a\nstatement of policy by the legislature\nthat leaves the detail to be\nfilled in by a court. It is policy that has been translated into law.\nIf it has not been adequately\ntranslated I do not think that it is\nfor courts to rewrite the statute. That would seem to me to strike at\nthe heart of the rule\nof law.\n[47]\tIt seems to me that the\nerror of the court below was to treat the subsection as if it\nexempted moneys that were yielded to a\ncompany as a capital profit\n(the moneys yielded to Appliances) as well as moneys that had an\nequivalent effect (the moneys received\nfrom Appliances), whereas the\nsubsection does not exempt both. It was by overlooking the\ndistinction â formalistic though the distinction\nmight be thought\nto be â that the court was driven to the result at which it rightly\nbaulked.\n[48]\tI agree with the submission\nby counsel for Defy that the reasons given by the court below for its\norder do not withstand scrutiny.\nBut an appeal lies against the order\nmade by a court rather than its reasons for doing so. For the reasons\nI have given I do not\nthink that any of the moneys that are now in\nissue were yielded to Defy as a capital profit and they were thus not\nexempt from STC.\nThat they had the effect of earning it a profit is\nimmaterial. The subsection exempts capital profits and not also\nmoneys that are\nnot capital profits but look much the same. In those\ncircumstances the order of the court below was correct, albeit for\nthe wrong\nreasons.\n[49]\tCounsel for Defy reminded us\nthat the tax court (and by extension this court) is confined by Rule\n12 to the issues defined in\nthe statement of the assessment read with\nthe grounds of appeal. He submitted that the grounds upon which I\nhave reached my conclusion,\nwhich were the subject of debate in\nargument before us, were not the grounds upon which the Commissioner\ndisallowed the objection.\nI find that submission to be astonishing.\nHis own heads of argument were directed substantially to the matters\nthat I have dealt\nwith in this judgment, as were those that were\nfiled on behalf of the respondent. So was Defyâs notice of appeal\nto the tax court,\nand the judgment of that court.\n[50]\tAs for the ground upon which\nthe Commissioner disallowed the objection, he said that a dividend\nis, by its nature, not a capital\nprofit. It needs to be borne that\nthe case might have been dealt with in either of two ways. If apples\nare exempt from tax, but pears\nare not, and a\npear\nis presented for exemption, one might examine the characteristics of\nan apple to see whether those characteristics are possessed\nby a\npear, which is the approach that I have adopted. The Commissioner\napproached the matter more directly. He said that if what\nhas been\npresented is a pear, then it is certainly not an apple, whatever\ncharacteristics an apple might have. But the two approaches\ncome to\nthe same thing.\n[51]\tThe appeal is dismissed with\ncosts that include the costs of two counsel.\n___________________\nR W NUGENT\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\n:\nFor appellant:\tA R Bhana SC\nJ Boltar\nInstructed by:\nWebber Wentzel, Johannesburg\nMcIntyre & Van der Post,\nBloemfontein\nFor respondent:\tP Ginsburg SC\nT Machara\nG Goldman\nInstructed by:\nThe State Attorney, Pretoria\nThe State Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\nBy s 34(1) of Act 113 of 1993.\n2\nInserted by s 40(1)(b) of Act 32 of 2004 with effect from 24\n\tJanuary 2004.\n3\nSubsection (f) of the definition of a âdividendâ.\n4\nThe qualification is designed to take account of capital gains tax,\n\twhich was introduced by the Eighth Schedule to the Act with\neffect\n\tfrom 1 October 2001.\n5\nThe R200 capital profit of the holding company is exempt from tax.\n\tThe remaining R100 is a taxable dividend, from which the R100\n\tdividend declared by the subsidiary is to be deducted under\n\tsubsection (3)(b).\n6\nThe outgoing dividend will be a capital profit of the holding\n\tcompany that is exempt from tax under subsection (5)(c)(ii), and\n\tfrom the declared dividend of nil the incoming dividend of R100\n\tfalls to be deducted under subsection (3)(b) leaving a negative\n\tbalance of R100.\n7\nSubject to an adjustment that was required to be made in accordance\n\twith the qualification to subsection (5)(c)(ii).\n8\nExcept for certain dormant subsidiaries.\n9\nI deal later with how that amount has been calculated.\n10\nShorter Oxford Dictionary\n: 1.

    "facts": "Defy Ltd, an investment company holding shares in several subsidiaries, entered into a transaction whereby its subsidiary, Defy Appliances (Pty) Ltd (\"Appliances\"), sold its business as a going concern to Clidet No 553 (Pty) Ltd. The sale generated a distribution to Defy of R426,152,780, comprising a loan repayment, a reduction of share premium, revenue profits and a capital profit of R206,080,510. Defy then distributed a total dividend of R498,000,000 to its shareholders. The Commissioner assessed secondary tax on companies (STC) on the net amount of R230,488,595, amounting to R28,811,074. Defy argued that the capital profit received from Appliances was a \"capital profit\" under s 64B(5)(c)(ii) and therefore exempt, contending that the exemption created a tax credit that should offset the tax on the taxable portion of the dividend.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was whether the amount received by Defy from its subsidiary, in anticipation of the subsidiary’s winding up, constituted a \"profit of a capital nature\" within the meaning of s 64B(5)(c)(ii) and was therefore exempt from STC. A subsidiary issue concerned whether the exemption could generate a tax credit that offsets tax on the remaining dividend.",
    "principles": "The Court examined the statutory framework of s 64B, focusing on the definition of a dividend, the calculation of the net amount, and the exemption under subsection 5(c)(ii). It held that the exemption applies only to profit derived from the disposal of a capital asset, i.e., the pecuniary gain realised on disposal of capital assets. The term \"profit\" must be interpreted in its ordinary sense as a gain from a transaction, not merely as an effect or equivalent. The Court rejected the argument that a dividend received could be treated as a capital profit absent a disposal of the underlying asset, emphasizing that statutory language requires an actual disposal for the exemption to arise.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court found that Defy did not dispose of its shareholding in Appliances; instead, it received a dividend that reflected the subsidiary’s capital profit. Because the money was received as a dividend rather than as proceeds of a disposal, it could not be characterised as a capital profit for the purposes of s 64B(5)(c)(ii). Consequently, the exemption did not apply, and the deduction under s 3(b) could not create a tax credit. The Commissioner’s calculation of the net amount and the resulting STC liability were therefore correct.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. Defy was ordered to pay the assessed secondary tax of R28,811,074, with costs including the costs of two counsel. The Court affirmed the Tax Court’s decision."
