For others, like communities who\r\nengage in subsistence\nfishing, they are a means of survival and a\r\nmodest source of income. In South Africa, West Coast rock lobster\r\n(WCRL) is a scarce\nresource, with commercial entities, subsistence\r\nand recreational fishers all competing for access to this rare\r\ncrustacean. Coastal\nfishing communities, including many previously\r\ndisadvantaged individuals, assert an entitlement to this scarce\r\nresource. Established\ncommercial fishing entities, on the other hand,\r\nare equally insistent about maintaining their existing long-term\r\nfishing rights\nand preventing any incursion from new competitors. The\r\nState, in its regulatory role, has to achieve a balance between these\r\ncompeting\ninterests. The litigation leading up to this appeal was\r\nabout whether the State legitimately went about that task.\n[2] The appellants had applied in the\r\nCape High Court for an order reviewing and setting aside decisions by\r\nthe first three respondents\ngranting subsistence fishers generally,\r\nand the fourth to 1 245\nth\nrespondents in particular,\r\nrights to catch and sell WCRL. In addition, the appellants had\nsought a declaratory order in the\r\nfollowing terms:\n‘\n[T]hat\r\nthe First Respondent is precluded from using\nsection 81\nof the\nMarine\nLiving Resources Act 18 of 1998\nin order to grant [subsistence]\r\nfishers generally, and the Fourth to 1 245\nth\nRespondents\r\nin particular, a right to catch and sell West Coast rock lobster for\r\ncommercial purposes.’\n[3] The application was dismissed with\r\ncosts, including the costs of two counsel. This appeal is before us\r\nwith the leave of this\ncourt.\n[4] The first appellant, the West\r\nCoast Rock Lobster Association, describes itself as a non-profit\r\norganisation whose members presently\nall hold long-term fishing\r\nrights in terms of s 18(1) of the Marine Living Resources Act 18 of\r\n1998 (the MLRA), to undertake commercial\nfishing for WCRL. The second\r\nappellant, Stephan Francois Smuts, is the holder of long-term\r\ncommercial fishing rights in the WCRL\nNearshore fishery. The third\r\nappellant is Sahra Luyt, who also holds long-term commercial fishing\r\nrights in the WCRL Nearshore\nfishery. The fourth appellant, Sparkor\r\n(Pty) Ltd, is a company that holds long-term commercial fishing\r\nrights in the WCRL Offshore\nfishery. The meaning of nearshore and\r\noffshore fishing rights will become clear in due course.\n[5] The first three\r\nrespondents are the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism\r\n(the Minister), his Deputy Director-General\nMarine and Coastal\r\nDevelopments, and his Chief Director. The fourth to 1 245\nth\nrespondents are individuals to whom the Minister, purportedly in\r\nterms of s 81 of the MLRA, either granted rights, or who have\nbeen\r\nidentified as possible recipients of rights to catch WCRL. The 134\nth\nrespondent is Kenneth Blaauw, a subsistence fisher, who was\r\nrepresented during the appeal and who, in turn, came to be\r\nrepresentative\nof the remaining respondents.\n[6] Section 81 of the MLRA, under the\r\nheading ‘Exemptions’, provides:\n‘\n(1)\r\nIf in the opinion of the Minister there are sound reasons for doing\r\nso, he or she may, subject to the conditions that he or\nshe may\r\ndetermine, in writing exempt any person or group of persons or organ\r\nof state from a provision of this Act.\n(2) An exemption granted\r\nin terms of subsection (1) may at any time be cancelled or amended by\r\nthe Minister.’\n[7] The decisions by the first three\r\nrespondents sought to be impugned in the court below, referred to in\r\npara 2, are no longer\nin issue because time and circumstance have\r\novertaken them. This appeal is against the refusal by the court below\r\nto grant the\ndeclaratory order set out above. It was submitted on\r\nbehalf of the appellants, both in the court below and before us, that\r\nwhilst\nthe power set out in s 81 may rightly be employed to\r\nexempt persons from requirements such as having to lodge applications\n\nfor fishing rights within a prescribed time, or from having to pay\r\nfees for fishing permits it may not, as happened in this case,\nbe\r\nemployed to grant fishing rights. The appellants sought to persuade\r\nus that by resorting to s 81 of the MLRA, in the manner\nmore\r\nfully described later in this judgment, to grant rights to the fourth\r\nto 1 245\nth\nrespondents to catch and sell WCRL, the\r\nMinister was subverting other applicable provisions of the statute,\r\nmore particularly those\ndealing with the manner in which fishing\r\nrights are to be allocated.\n[8] As will become apparent the appeal\r\nfalls to be determined within a narrow compass. The question whether\r\na decision on the issues\nreferred to in the preceding paragraph will\r\nhave any practical effect and the ambit of the declaratory order are\r\ncrucial in that\nregard and are aspects which I shall deal with in due\r\ncourse. For the benefit of the reader, however, it is necessary to\r\nfirst\nset out the background.\n[9] The MLRA, which was promulgated on\r\n21 May 1998 and came into effect on 1 September 1998, signalled a new\r\nera in marine ecosystem\nconservation. The preamble to the MLRA reads\r\nas follows:\n‘\nTo\r\nprovide for the conservation of the marine ecosystem, the long-term\r\nsustainable utilisation of marine living resources and the\norderly\r\naccess to exploitation, utilisation and protection of certain marine\r\nliving resources; and for these purposes to provide\nfor the exercise\r\nof control over marine living resources in a fair and equitable\r\nmanner to the benefit of all the citizens of South\nAfrica; and to\r\nprovide for matters connected therewith.’\n[10] In line with the MLRA’s\r\nconservation objective s 18 prohibits commercial or subsistence\r\nfishing unless ‘a\nright to undertake or engage in such an\r\nactivity . . . has been granted . . . by the Minister’. The\r\nrelevant parts of s 14(2)\nof the MLRA provide that the Minister\r\n‘shall determine the portions of the total allowable catch, . .\r\n. or a combination\nthereof, to be allocated in any year to\r\nsubsistence, recreational, local, commercial and foreign fishing,\r\nrespectively’.\n[11] As set out in the judgment of the\r\ncourt below the total allowable catch (the TAC) is the maximum\r\nquantity of fish that is legally\navailable during each fishing season\r\nfor combined recreational, subsistence, commercial and foreign\r\nfishing. It is one of the principal\nmeans by which the Minister\r\nensures that fish stocks are not over-exploited. It is within that\r\nTAC that fishing rights granted\nby the Minister are exercised.\r\nSection 18(5) of the MLRA provides that in granting fishing rights\r\nthe Minister ‘shall . .\n. have particular regard to the need to\r\npermit new entrants, particularly those from historically\r\ndisadvantaged sectors of society’.\n[12] WCRL is but one of the many\r\nspecies of marine life requiring protection and in respect of which\r\nthe Minister grants fishing\nrights. WCRL and abalone are very\r\nvaluable and are naturally under intense pressure of\r\nover-exploitation. The pressure arises not\nonly from legitimate and\r\nregulated fishing but also from unregulated illegal fishing\r\noperations and conservation measures are self-evidently\na national\r\nimperative.\n[13] WCRL occurs inside the 200-metre\r\ndepth contour from just north of Walvis Bay in Namibia to East London\r\nin the Eastern Cape.\nFemale size at maturity ranges from\r\napproximately 57 mm carapace length (CL) to 66 mm CL. Male lobsters\r\nattain a larger size and\ngrow faster than females. As a result of the\r\nsize limit of 75 mm CL that is currently imposed on commercial\r\nfishers, male lobsters\nmake up virtually the whole of the catch.\r\nCommercial exploitation of WCRL in South Africa occurs from the mouth\r\nof the Orange River\nin the north-west to Danger Point in the Cape\r\nSouth Coast. Recreational fishing covers the same area, but also\r\nextends further\neastwards towards Mossel Bay.\n[14] Commercial fishing for WCRL dates\r\nback more than a century. Initially there was very little regulation\r\nof the WCRL industry.\nNotwithstanding a minimum size of 89 mm CL\r\nintroduced in 1933 and a tail mass quota limitation in 1946, catches\r\nin excess of 10\n000 tons per annum were maintained from 1950 to 1965\r\nputting enormous strain on the resource and endangering its long-term\r\nsustainability.\nPredictably, by the mid-1960’s WCRL hauls had\r\nbegun to decline appreciably. In response, tail mass production\r\nquotas were\nreduced. In the 1970’s tail mass production quotas\r\nwere replaced by a whole lobster (landed mass) quota, in tandem with\r\na\nTAC limitation. Various other measures were also introduced,\r\nincluding the introduction of area limitations, the stipulation of\n\nsize limitations, the establishment of a closed season and the\r\nbanning of catches of berried or soft-shelled WCRL. These measures\n\ncombined to restore some balance to the WCRL industry, and TAC\r\nstabilised at between 3 500 and 4 000 tons per annum.\n[15] In the 1990/1\r\nseason there was another notable decline in the somatic growth rate\r\nof WCRL.\n1\nThere were fewer\r\nWCRL of legal size. Up until the mid 90s the commercial TAC was\r\ngradually reduced reaching as low as 1 500 tons\nin the 1995/6 season.\r\nThere was a slow recovery of the resource up to the 2004/5 season\r\nwhen the global TAC was 3 527 tons. Unfortunately,\nin recent seasons,\r\nWCRL has been placed under renewed significant pressure. The global\r\nTAC in the 2007/8 season was decreased to\n2 571 tons. WCRL is a\r\nslow-growing crustacean and due to the slow recruitment of the adult\r\npopulation any recovery plan must be\na long-term one.\n[16] In his\r\naffidavit opposing the relief sought by the appellants in the court\r\nbelow, the Minister explained that the short, medium\nand long-term\r\nfishing rights allocation processes with which his department’s\r\nMarine and Coastal Development branch (MCM)\nhad been involved over\r\nthe past decade had focused primarily on the interests of medium and\r\nlarge sized commercial entities. The\ninterests of surrounding coastal\r\ncommunities and subsistence fishers and their access to the use of\r\nthe marine living resources\nhave hitherto been neglected,\r\nnotwithstanding the provisions of s 18(5) set out above.\n2\nOnly in recent\r\nyears have their interests received the necessary attention. The\r\ndispute giving rise to the litigation that culminated\nin the present\r\nappeal arose from that historical imbalance.\n[17] The Minister described the\r\nproblems attendant upon the allocation of fishing rights to\r\nsubsistence and smaller scale users\nof our country’s marine\r\nliving resources. Coastal communities have historically depended and\r\nrelied on fishing along the\ncoast to earn a living. WCRL fishing, as\r\nindicated above, is lucrative and the demand from this category of\r\nusers far exceeds the\nsustainability of the resources. Although the\r\nnumber of participants in this group is large the quantum of fish\r\ninvolved in their\nquota is relatively small compared to that\r\nexploited by medium and large commercial enterprises. It has been\r\ndifficult to assess\ntheir impact on the resources they access,\r\nlegally and illegally.\n[18] Government set in motion a\r\nprocess to develop a management policy in order to deal with the\r\ngrowing clamour by subsistence\nusers and small commercial entities\r\nfor access to a share of the TAC. This process has taken longer than\r\nanticipated. According\nto the Minister this was due to a larger group\r\nof fishers than initially anticipated having to be accommodated in\r\nthe consultation\nprocess.\n[19] One of the\r\nissues facing government in its regulatory function is that it has\r\nobligations towards coastal communities under\ninternational treaties,\r\nprincipally the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nthe Voluntary Code of Conduct for Responsible\nFisheries adopted by\r\nthe Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations on 31\r\nOctober 1995. These instruments oblige\nthe government of the Republic\r\nof South Africa to heed the economic and socio-economic needs of\r\ncoastal fishing communities.\n3\n[20] Problems hampering government in\r\nits attempts to accommodate subsistence and small-scale fishers who\r\nwere seeking access to\nWCRL are largely due to its own making. Around\r\nthe beginning of the new millennium the Ministry had phased out\r\nsubsistence permits\nand restyled them as ‘limited commercial\r\nrights’. In allocating these limited commercial rights the\r\nMinister had failed\nto accommodate a large number of subsistence\r\nfishers from coastal communities seeking access to the limited\r\nresource. The ‘limited\ncommercial rights’ that had been\r\ngranted were part of a medium-term fishing allocation of four-year\r\nduration.\n[21] In 2005 the Minister invited\r\napplications for long-term fishing rights of ten-year duration. The\r\nformer full-term commercial\nrights, which catered for medium and\r\nlarge scale commercial entities, were re-branded as ‘rights in\r\nthe off-shore fishery’\nand comprised rights allocations greater\r\nthat 1.5 tons. The previous ‘limited commercial rights’\r\nwere now known as\ncommercial ‘rights in the near-shore fishery’\r\nand accommodated 820 individuals who were historically dependent on\r\nthe\nresource. They ran relatively small-scale commercial operations,\r\nin inshore areas using smaller boats and hoop-nets. The changes\n\nbrought about by renaming categories were changes in form rather than\r\nsubstance. Thus, the Minister had committed himself to these\n\nright-holders on a long-term basis and was still facing further calls\r\nby a large number of individuals for inclusion in the near-shore\n\nfishery.\n[22] As the calls by subsistence and\r\nsmall scale fishers for inclusion grew ever louder, so too did the\r\nresistance by those already\nin possession of long-term rights. The\r\nbattle lines were drawn and tensions mounted. Consultations with and\r\nrepresentations to\nthe Ministry followed.\n[23] The consultation and policy\r\ndevelopment processes dragged on and the pressure increased on the\r\nMinister to find a means to\naccommodate those who had previously been\r\nexcluded and who desperately sought access to the resource. The\r\nMinister’s problems\nwere compounded when a non-governmental\r\norganisation, Masifundise, assisted subsistence fishers in the\r\nEquality Court to seek relief\nagainst him, based on their alleged\r\nwrongful exclusion from access to WCRL. The present appellants were\r\nnot party to that litigation.\n[24] In May 2007\r\nthe Minister, in settlement of that litigation, and in accordance\r\nwith an agreement which was made an order of\nthe Equality Court,\r\npublicly announced ‘interim measures to accommodate fishers\r\nalong the Western and Southern Cape coastline’.\nIn terms of\r\nthat arrangement Masifundise undertook to identify 1 000 bona\r\nfide ‘artisanal’ (subsistence) fishers\nwho were not\r\nholders of existing commercial fishing rights allocated in terms of s\r\n18 of the MLRA and who could ‘demonstrate\nboth historical\r\ndependence and reliance’. It was agreed that the names of those\r\nso identified would be submitted to the Minister’s\nDepartment.\r\nThose who qualified would be required to apply for a recreational\r\nfishing permit.\n4\nThe Minister, in\r\nturn, after considering whether they met the criteria, would:\n‘\n[B]y\r\nway of exemption, until 31 December 2007 or any earlier date\r\nidentified herein, permit the identified fishers to engage in\nfishing\r\nand to sell the lawfully caught catch under the authority of the\r\nrecreational permit the following: . . .\n4.1 four West Coast rock\r\nlobster per day, every day of the week until 31 May 2007; . . .’.\nIn addition, the persons who qualified\r\nand who were holders of recreational permits were granted the right\r\nto catch stipulated quantities\nof other species of marine life until\r\n30 September 2007.\n[25] The order of the Equality Court\r\nrecords that ‘the exemption may be renewed for a further\r\nstipulated period if necessary.\n. .’. The order of the Equality\r\nCourt is dated 2 May 2007 and, as can be seen from what is set out in\r\nthe preceding paragraph,\nthe initial ‘interim’ right to\r\nfish for WCRL was for a very limited duration.\n[26] Following on the public\r\nannouncement the first appellant and its members, considering this\r\nexercise of the power of exemption\nas an abuse of the provisions of\r\nthe MLRA, engaged the Minister in correspondence and discussions.\r\nThat process dragged on for\nmonths during the latter half of 2007 and\r\nthe beginning of 2008. When the Minister appeared bent on proceeding\r\nwith further interim\nmeasures in the same vein as referred to above,\r\nbut for a longer period the appellants resorted to the litigation in\r\nthe court\nbelow in March 2008.\n[27] The Minister’s own\r\nscientific advice indicated that the further interim measures he\r\nintended proceeding with would result\nin the TAC for WCRL being\r\nexceeded and not being absorbed within the recreational catch, which\r\nwas the Minister’s objective.\nNonetheless, the Minister took\r\nthe view that there were compelling reasons to proceed. The following\r\npart of the Minister’s\nanswering affidavit is significant:\n‘\n[F]rom\r\na humanitarian and socio-economic perspective understood in the\r\ncontext . . . of the MLRA and the considerations that led\nto the\r\nsettlement of the Equality Court case, it was very important that the\r\naffected group of fishers be accommodated, inter alia,\nwith access to\r\nWCRL. Time did not permit a process of rights allocations to them\r\nunder s 18 coupled with a possible re-allocation\nfor commercial\r\nTAC under s 14. The development of the policy had been held up longer\r\nthan expected, not due to the fault of the\ninterim relief fishers.\r\nNot addressing their needs could, and probably would, cause very\r\nsevere hardship for the interim relief\nfishers. . . . In my opinion,\r\nthese were sound reasons for addressing this issue by way of\r\nexemptions under s 81.’\n[28] The following statement by the\r\nMinister is of some importance:\n‘\nTo\r\nthe extent that the small scale fishers would compete with the\r\nexisting commercial rights holders, I considered that their impact\n\nwould probably be minimal and would in any event not be in a market\r\nsector in which the large commercial interests participated\n\nmeaningfully.’\n[29] The court\r\nbelow (Davis J),\n5\nin considering\r\nwhether the Minister had properly used the power of exemption\r\nprovided for in s 81 of the Act, had regard to the\nfull bench\r\ndecision in\nLaingville\r\nFisheries (Pty) Ltd v The Minister of Environmental Affairs and\r\nTourism\n.\n6\nIn that case the\r\npower of exemption provided for in s 81 of the MLRA was described as\r\na ‘wide discretion’ to exempt\na person from any provision\r\nof the Act. The court below concluded that there was no basis for a\r\ncontention that the Minister may\nonly exempt a person from certain\r\nprovisions of the Act but not others. Davis J said the following\r\n(para 31):\n‘\nNo\r\nsection remains untouchable or out of reach of the exemption power\r\ncontained in section 81. That conclusion does not follow from\nthe\r\nwording of the provision and the interpretation of the provision by\r\nthe Full Bench.’\n[30] The learned judge went on to say\r\n(para 34):\n‘\nIn\r\neffect what happened was the following: The respondent fishers were\r\nexempted from the provision that they would not undertake\ncommercial\r\nfishing without having been granted a right thereto by the first\r\nrespondent. To the extent that the exemption letter\nconstituted a\r\npermit, they were also exempted from paying any fee for this permit.’\n[31] The court below held that the\r\nMinister had acted rationally and that the transformative agenda of\r\nthe MLRA, of restructuring\nthe fishing industry to address the\r\nhistorical imbalances of the past, had rightly been taken into\r\naccount. Davis J described the\nMinister’s decision-making as\r\nfollows:\n‘\nThat\r\nhe did so in the fashion set out in the evidence is indicative of a\r\ndecision maker having to make a difficult decision in the\nallocation\r\nof limited resources but doing so in a fashion in which he was\r\ncognisant of the competing interests which, in any event,\nmay be\r\nintrinsic to section 2 of the MLRA.’\nHe held that the Minister had acted\nintra vires\nin his application of s 81 and went on to dismiss\r\nthe application with costs.\n[32] Subsequent to the judgment of the\r\ncourt below the respondents approached the Equality Court once again\r\nand once more an order\nwas made by that court in accordance with an\r\nagreement reached with the Minister. That order is dated 19 November\r\n2008 (approximately\nsix weeks after the judgment of the court below).\r\nIn terms of the order the Minister undertook to finalise the policy\r\ndevelopment\nprocess by publication in the Government Gazette by 31\r\nJuly 2009. Furthermore, subsistence fishers who were identified in\r\nthe same\nway as before and who held recreational fishing permits\r\nwould, by way of exemption by the Minister, be granted the right to\r\ncatch,\ninter alia, 20 WCRL per person per week from 15 November 2008\r\nto 15 April 2009 (on weekdays only).\n[33] In refusing leave to appeal,\r\nDavis J thought it important that the decision by the Minister was\r\n‘buttressed’ by\nthe two orders of the Equality Court,\r\nwhich he reasoned it was not competent for him to overturn. In\r\naddition, Davis J was\nnot persuaded that another court would\r\ncome to a different conclusion on the interpretation and application\r\nof s 81 of the MLRA.\n[34] The facts in\nLaingville\n,\r\nwhere applications for fishing rights were lodged beyond a time\r\ndeadline set by the Minister and where the court held that s 81\ncould\r\nbe employed by him to exempt persons from that requirement, are of\r\ncourse far removed from the facts of the present case.\n[35] It was submitted on behalf of the\r\nappellants that the Minister could not re-categorise subsistence\r\nfishers and pretend they\nwere recreational fishers in order to get\r\naround the seemingly already fully subscribed rights in the\r\nsubsistence sector. The appellants\ncontended that by employing s 81\r\nin the manner referred to above, the Minister was subverting the very\r\npurpose of the Act and that\nthe granting of rights ought to be dealt\r\nwith in terms of s 18 of the MLRA.\n[36] There is some force in the attack\r\nby the appellants on the Minister’s application of s 81 of the\r\nMLRA. There is also\nthe allied concern that permitting such a wide\r\npower of exemption could result in the executive being able to undo\r\nthe structure,\npurpose and principles of the legislation. That\r\nconcern would have as a concomitant that the jurisdictional lines\r\nbetween the various\narms of government would be blurred. It was\r\nargued that the effect of using an exemption provision in the manner\r\nresorted to by\nthe Minister is to subvert not only the definition of\r\nrecreational fishing, referred to above, but also s 20(1) of the MLRA\r\nwhich\nprovides that ‘no person shall sell, barter or trade any\r\nfish caught through recreational fishing’.\n[37] On the other hand, it was\r\nsubmitted on behalf of the respondents that s 81 of the MLRA could\r\nrightly be used, as the Minister\ndid in this case, to grant fishing\r\nrights. It was contended that s 18 militated against the common-law\r\nentitlement to retain a\ncatch from the sea and that by granting an\r\nexemption in terms of s 81 of the MLRA the Minister was restoring the\r\ncommon-law position,\nthereby, in effect, granting the rights\r\nchallenged by the appellants. The counter-submission by the\r\nappellants in that regard was\nthat the MLRA now regulated the fishing\r\nindustry and that its core provisions, in the interests of\r\nconservation, had to be maintained\nand enforced.\n[38] It is unnecessary to deal with\r\nall the submissions in this regard and to decide that issue finally,\r\nbecause the appeal fails\nat two related fundamental preliminary\r\nlevels.\n[39] Before dealing with them it is\r\nnecessary to deal briefly with a submission on behalf of the 134\nth\nrespondent, namely, that the appellants lacked\nlocus standi\n.\r\nIt was contended that the appellants have no direct and substantial\r\ninterest in the interim relief afforded to the subsistence\nfishers: a\r\nmere financial or personal interest did not suffice and that the\r\ninterest had to be related to the relief sought by\nthe appellants.\r\nThey contend that the appellants’ commercial rights were not\r\ninfringed upon by the rights granted to the\nsubsistence fishers. I am\r\nwilling to assume in favour of the appellants, without deciding the\r\nmatter finally, that they have the\nnecessary\nlocus standi\n. I\r\nturn to deal with the two fundamental reasons why the appeal should\r\nfail.\n[40] First, courts will not decide\r\nissues of academic interest only. In\nRadio Pretoria v Chairman,\r\nIndependent Communications Authority of South Africa\n2005 (1) SA\r\n47\n(SCA) this court had regard to s 21A(1) of the Supreme Court\nAct 59 of 1959 which provides:\n‘\n(1)\r\nWhen at the hearing of any civil appeal to the Appellate Division or\r\nany Provincial or Local Division of the Supreme Court the\nissues are\r\nof such a nature that the judgment or order sought will have no\r\npractical effect or result, the appeal may be dismissed\non this\r\nground alone.’\n[41] In that case this court was\r\nconcerned about a proliferation of appeals that had no prospect of\r\nbeing heard on the merits as\nthe orders sought would have had no\r\npractical effect and referred to\nRand Water Board v Rotek\r\nIndustries (Pty) Ltd\n2003 (4) SA 58\n(SCA), at 63H-I, where the\r\nfollowing was said:\n‘\nThe\r\npresent case is a good example of this Court’s experience in\r\nthe recent past, including unreported cases, that there is\na growing\r\nmisperception that there has been a relaxation or dilution of the\r\nfundamental principle . . . that Courts will not make\ndeterminations\r\nthat will have no practical effect.’\n[42] In\nNational Coalition for Gay\r\nand Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs\n2000 (2) SA 1\n(CC) the Constitutional Court said the following (para 21, fn\r\n18):\n‘\nA\r\ncase is moot and therefore not justifiable if it no longer presents\r\nan existing or live controversy which should exist if the\nCourt is to\r\navoid giving advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.’\n[43] As set out above, the time\r\nperiods during which the Equality Court orders operated have passed.\r\nThe measures reflected therein\nwere described as ‘interim’\r\nand it was always understood by all that a policy would some day be\r\nfinalised that would\ninform future conservation measures and the\r\ngranting of fishing rights in the future. The Equality Court orders\r\ncertainly did not\noperate at any time so as to prevent the court\r\nbelow from deciding the dispute. The second Equality Court order,\r\nobtained pending\nan application for leave to appeal, contemplated a\r\ndate for finalisation of the new policy, namely 31 July 2009. That\r\ntime too\nhas come and gone. A further fishing season has passed since\r\nthen and we are unaware of how subsistence fishers were accommodated\n\ntherein, if at all. There is no indication on the record that the\r\ninterim measures contained in the Equality Court orders are to\nbe\r\nrepeated in respect of the new fishing season that begins in November\r\n2010.\n[44] In\nRadio Pretoria\n, at para\r\n40, this court said:\n‘\n[T]here\r\nis no clear indication that another case on identical facts will\r\nsurface in the future.’\nThe same applies here.\n[45] It is true\r\nthat this court said more than four decades ago, in\nEx\r\nparte Nell\n1963\r\n(1) SA 754\n(A), that the absence of an existing dispute was not an\r\nabsolute bar to the grant of a declaratory order. What\nwas\nrequired was that\r\nthere should be interested parties upon whom the declaratory order\r\nwould be binding. In considering whether to\ngrant a declaratory order\r\na court exercises a discretion with due regard to the circumstances.\r\nThe court must be satisfied that\nthe applicant has an interest in an\r\nexisting, future or contingent right or obligation. If the court is\r\nso satisfied it must consider\nwhether or not the order should be\r\ngranted.\n7\nIn exercising its\r\ndiscretion the court may decline to deal with the matter where there\r\nis no actual dispute.\n8\nThe court may\r\ndecline to grant a declaratory order if it regards the question\r\nraised before it as hypothetical, abstract or academic.\nWhere a court\r\nof first instance has declined to make a declaratory order and it is\r\nheld on appeal that that decision is wrong the\nmatter will usually be\r\nremitted to the lower court.\n[46] All interested parties were not\r\nbefore the court below and there was no indication on the record that\r\na declaratory order,\nassuming it to be enforceable in its proposed\r\nform, would have any practical effect. These factors in themselves\r\npresented an insurmountable\nobstacle for the appellants.\n[47] Second,\nand as\r\nfundamentally fatal to the appellants’ case as the first, is\r\nthe nature and extent of the declaratory order sought\nin the court\r\nbelow. In the light of the reasoning of the court below and its\r\nrefusal to review and set aside the Minister’s\ndecision, it was\r\nunnecessary for it to go further and deal specifically with the terms\r\nof the proposed declaratory order. The appellants\nsought thereby to\r\nbar the Minister from using s 81 of the MLRA to grant subsistence\r\nfishers a right to catch and sell WCRL for\ncommercial purposes.\n[48] It appears that insufficient\r\nthought was given to the wording of the order sought. Subsistence\r\nfishers are entitled to engage\nin limited commercial activity. A\r\nsubsistence fisher is defined in s 1 of the MLRA:\n‘\n[A]\r\nnatural person who regularly catches fish for personal consumption or\r\nfor the consumption of his or her dependants, including\none who\r\nengages from time to time in the local sale or barter of excess\r\ncatch, but does not include a person who engages on a substantial\n\nscale in the sale of fish on a commercial basis.’\n[49] The effect of granting the\r\nproposed order would be to bar subsistence fishers as a class from\r\nactivity they can lawfully engage\nin, albeit in a limited manner,\r\nnamely, the sale of a part of their catch. The order proposed does\r\nnot deal with the nub of the\nappellants’ complaint that\r\nsubsistence fishers are being dressed up by the Minister as\r\nrecreational fishers, to get around\nthe already fully-subscribed\r\nsubsistence quota. They point out that by definition recreational\r\nfishers are precluded from selling\nany part of their catch. The\r\nappellants contend, as I have said, that it is this unworkable\r\nfiction that is subversive of the objectives\nand principles of the\r\nAct. The proposed declaratory order does not address the appellants’\r\ncomplaint.\n[50] The problem is compounded for the\r\nappellants by the fact that the proposed order is in substance a\r\nperpetual interdict purporting\nto prejudicially affect a whole class\r\nof persons (subsistence fishers), including persons who are not\r\njoined as parties to the\nlitigation but who might have wanted to say\r\nsomething in opposition to the relief sought. It is a fundamental\r\nprinciple that all\ninterested parties should be joined in an\r\napplication that may affect their rights. See in this regard Farlam,\r\nVan Loggerenberg\nand Fichardt\nErasmus Superior Court Practice\nat A1-33 and the authorities there cited.\n[51] There might\r\nconceivably be circumstances in which subsistence fishers could\r\nrightly be granted an exemption in terms of s 81,\nentitling them to\r\nsell fish that they might otherwise have consumed. There may well be\r\npermutations that do not readily suggest\nthemselves to the parties\r\npresently before us but which might occur to subsistence fishers who\r\nare not parties to the present litigation.\nGranting the declaratory\r\norder in the terms sought would be closing the door forever and a day\r\nto that possibility and would bind\npersons who are strangers to the\r\npresent dispute. A declaratory order cannot affect the rights of\r\npersons who are not parties to\nthe proceedings.\n9\n[52] An attempt was made during the\r\ndying seconds of final submissions in reply on behalf of the\r\nappellants to amend the terms of\nthe declaratory order to deal with\r\nthe problems referred to in paras 47 to 49 above. Alas, it likewise\r\ndid not satisfactorily address\nthe concerns alluded to and for the\r\nvarious reasons set out above, that attempt too must fail.\n[53] There is one\r\nremaining aspect. This court has recently seen a number of cases in\r\nwhich\n10\njurisdictional\r\nquestions have arisen in relation to Equality Court matters. The\r\ndissonance in the interplay between the Equality\nCourt and high\r\ncourts has been brought into sharp focus. In this case Davis J,\r\nsitting as a high court judge, questioned whether\nhe could validly\r\ncut across a decision of the Equality Court in a case not involving\r\nall the parties before him. Parties have sometimes\nresorted to\r\nparallel and cross-cutting litigation. Legal uncertainty arises and\r\nlitigation abounds, the antithesis of what was\nintended by the\nPromotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4\nof 2000\n.\n11\nThese are issues\r\nthat should be of concern to the legislature and other interested\r\nparties. The Registrar is therefore directed\nto bring this judgment\r\nto the attention of the Chief State Law Advisor and the Minister for\r\nJustice and Constitutional Development.\n[54] In light of the conclusions set\r\nout above the following order is made:\n1 The appeal is dismissed.\n2 The appellants are ordered to pay\r\nthe respondents’ costs, including the costs attendant upon the\r\nemployment of two counsel.\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nAppellant: S Burger SC\nE\r\nFagan SC\nInstructed\r\nby\nWebber\r\nWentzel Cape Town\nMatsepes\r\nInc Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nfirst to third Respondent: W R E Duminy SC\nInstructed\r\nby\nThe\r\nState Attorney Cape Town\nThe\r\nState Attorney Bloemfontein\nFor\r\n134\nth\nRespondent: J J Gauntlett SC\nF\r\nB Pelser\nInstructed\r\nby\nLegal\r\nResources Centre Cape Town\nWebbers\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nThis\r\n\tmeans the extent of the physical growth of the creature itself.\n2\nSection\r\n\t2(j)\nof the MLRA provides that the Minister and any organ of State\r\n\t‘shall in exercising any power under this Act have regard to\n.\r\n\t. . the need to restructure the fishing industry to address\r\n\thistorical imbalances and to achieve equity within all branches\nof\r\n\tthe fishing industry’.\n3\nSection\r\n\t2(i) obliges the Minister and any organ of State, in exercising any\r\n\tpower under the MLRA to have regard to ‘any\nrelevant\r\n\tobligation of the national government or the Republic in terms of\r\n\tany international agreement or applicable rule of\ninternational\r\n\tlaw’.\n4\nRecreational\r\n\tfishing is defined in s 1 of the MLRA as ‘any fishing done for\r\n\tleisure or sport\nand not\r\n\tfor sale, barter, earnings or gain\n’\n.\r\n\t(My emphasis.)\n5\n[2008]\r\n\tZAWCHC 123\n(7 October 2008).\n6\n[2008]\r\n\tZAWCHC 28\n(30 May 2008).\n7\nCordiant\r\n\tTrading CC v Daimler Chrysler Financial Services (Pty) Ltd\n2005\r\n\t(6) SA 205\n(SCA) at 213E-G.\n8\nEx\r\n\tparte Nell\n1963 (1) SA 754\n(A) at 760B.\n9\nSee\nSA Mutual Life Assurance Society v Durban City Council\n1948\r\n\t(1) SA 1\n(N) and Farlam\net al op cit\nat A1-33 to A1-34.\n10\nMinister\r\n\tof Environmental Affairs and Tourism v George\n2007 (3) SA 62\n(SCA);\nManong & Associates (Pty) Ltd v Department of Roads\r\n\tand Transport, Eastern Cape (No 1)\n2009 (6) SA 574\n(SCA);\nManong\r\n\t& Associates (Pty) Ltd v Department of Roads and Transport\r\n\tEastern Cape (No 2)\n2009 (6) SA 589\n(SCA).\n11\nSee\r\n\tthe remarks of this court in\nManong (No 2)\nop cit para 53.",

  "sections": {
    "facts": "The West Coast Rock Lobster (WCRL) resource is scarce and contested by commercial, subsistence and recreational fishers. The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism used the exemption power in section 81 of the Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA) to grant interim fishing rights to a large number of subsistence fishers, allowing them to catch and sell a limited quantity of lobsters. These exemptions were intended as temporary measures pending the finalisation of a policy on allocation of the total allowable catch (TAC). Equality Court orders in 2007 and 2008 confirmed the interim nature of the measures. The appellants, holders of long‑term commercial fishing rights, challenged the Minister’s use of section 81 and sought a declaratory order precluding the Minister from using that power to grant commercial‑type rights to subsistence fishers.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the Minister’s reliance on section 81 of the MLRA to grant interim fishing rights to subsistence fishers was intra vires and consistent with the Act’s allocation regime under sections 14, 18 and 18(5). 2) Whether the appellants had standing to challenge the exemptions. 3) Whether the appeal was moot because the interim measures had expired and no practical effect remained. 4) Whether the declaratory order sought was appropriate in scope, given it would bind persons not before the court.",
    "principles": "The court applied the interpretation of section 81 from Laingville Fisheries v Minister, confirming that the exemption power is wide but must be exercised within the purpose of the MLRA. It also relied on the principle that courts will not hear matters with no practical effect (Radio Pretoria v ICA, National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister). Declaratory orders must be limited to parties before the court and cannot affect a whole class of strangers (Ex parte Nell). Locus standi was acknowledged but not determinative. The statutory purpose of the MLRA—to conserve marine resources and allocate rights equitably—was highlighted.",
    "application": "The court held that the Minister’s interim exemptions were lawful and fell within his discretion, especially given the humanitarian and socio‑economic reasons recognised by the Equality Court. The measures were temporary; the Equality Court orders had expired and the TAC for the relevant season had already been set, so the appeal could not produce a practical outcome. Moreover, the declaratory order sought would permanently bar subsistence fishers—a class not before the court—from activities they are statutorily permitted to undertake, exceeding the court’s jurisdiction. Consequently, both substantive and procedural grounds for the appeal failed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The appellants were ordered to pay the respondents’ costs, including the costs of two counsel."
