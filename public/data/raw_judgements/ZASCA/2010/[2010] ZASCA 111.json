This led to the MEC for Local Government, Housing\r\nand\nTraditional Affairs (at the time Mr M Mabuyakhulu, the brother to\r\none of the removed councillors) applying to the High Court,\r\nPietermaritzburg\nfor a declaratory order which, if granted, would\r\noblige the council to accept the two councillors back onto the\r\nexecutive committee.\nAny inference of nepotism on his part caused by\r\nhis action has been dissipated by the problem in this case not being\r\nunique to\nthe first respondent and his successors in office having\r\npersisted with the proceedings in order to obtain guidance from the\r\ncourt.\nIn any event, the application was dismissed and, with the\r\nleave of the court a quo, the appellant (the current MEC) appeals now\n\nto this court against that decision.\n[2]\tEvery municipality must have a\r\ncouncil\n1\nthat is obliged, inter alia, to strive to achieve the objectives\r\ndetailed in s 152 of the Constitution, and to review the needs\nof the\r\ncommunity it serves, its priorities to meet those needs and its\r\nmechanisms for doing so.\n2\nThere are 25 councillors in the first respondent’s council, 15\r\nappointed by local municipalities and ten elected by voters.\nThe\r\ncouncillors are members of different political parties, namely, the\r\nsecond, third, fourth, fifth and sixth respondents in this\nappeal,\r\nalthough at all material times, most were either members of the\r\nsecond respondent, the Inkatha Freedom Party (‘the\nIFP’)\r\nor the African National Congress (‘the ANC’), the third\r\nrespondent. Every municipality must also have a\nchairperson, called\r\n‘the speaker’, elected from among the municipal\r\ncouncillors, either at the council’s first\nsitting after an\r\nelection or when necessary to fill a vacancy.\n3\n[3]\tThe first respondent operates\r\nunder a ‘collective executive system’ as envisaged by the\r\nAct and as mandated by the\nDetermination of Types of Municipality Act\r\n7 of 2000 (KZN). This entails it having an executive committee with\r\nvarious functions\nand powers.\n4\nSection 43 of the Act further provides:\n‘\n(1)\tIf\r\nthe council of a municipality establishes an executive committee, it\r\nmust elect a number of councillors necessary for effective\nand\r\nefficient government, provided that no more than 20 per cent of the\r\ncouncillors or 10 councillors, whichever is the least,\nare elected.\r\nAn executive committee may not have less than three members.\n(2)\tAn executive committee must\r\nbe composed in such a way that parties and interests represented in\r\nthe municipal council are represented\nin the executive committee in\r\nsubstantially the same proportion they are represented in the\r\ncouncil.\n(3)\tA\r\nmunicipal council may determine any alternative mechanism for the\r\nelection of an executive committee, provided it complies\nwith section\r\n160(8) of the Constitution.’\n5\n[4]\tThe first respondent’s\r\nexecutive committee was established on 3 April 2006 at the municipal\r\ncouncil’s inaugural\nmeeting. To give effect to the imperative\r\ncontained in s 43(2) of the Act, it comprised five members: two from\r\nthe ANC, two from\nthe IFP and one representing a minority party.\r\nCouncillors DB Mabuyakhulu and JCN Khumalo of the ANC were elected\r\nboth to the committee\nand as mayor and deputy-mayor,\n6\nrespectively, while councillor AT Zwane, another ANC member, was\r\nelected speaker of the council.\n7\n[5]\tAt the time of this meeting, and\r\nfor some time thereafter, the ANC, together with the support of a\r\nminority party with whom\nit formed a coalition, held a majority in\r\nthe council. However, in the fickleness of politics the minority\r\nparty later left the\nANC in the lurch and allied itself to the IFP\r\nwhich, with its support, then held a majority in the council. The\r\nmajority promptly\ncalled for a council meeting with the view of\r\nremoving the ANC councillors from the posts of mayor, deputy-mayor\r\nand speaker. Presumably\nin an attempt to retain those posts in ANC\r\nhands, the speaker turned a deaf ear to this request and, eventually,\r\nan application\nto compel the holding of a council meeting was brought\r\nin the Pietermaritzburg High Court. In a vain attempt to delay the\r\ninevitable,\nthe executive committee opposed the application. It is\r\nundisputed that councillors Mabuyakhulu and Khumalo (the mayor and\r\nhis deputy)\nwere the guiding hands behind this opposition which was\r\nfunded from the municipality’s coffers. Unfortunately for them,\r\nthe\napplication succeeded, a council meeting was held and, in due\r\ncourse, both they and the speaker were removed from office and\r\nreplaced.\n[6]\tThe council then proceeded to\r\nhold an investigation into the possible waste of municipal funds by\r\nthe council’s opposition\nto the application and, on 13 February\r\n2008, acting under s 53(1) of the Act,\n8\nit removed councillors Mabuyakhulu and Khumalo from the executive\r\ncommittee. Although they remained members of the council, they\nwere\r\nneither disciplined nor sanctioned (under item 14(2) of schedule 1 to\r\nthe\nLocal Government: Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000\nsteps may be\r\ntaken against councillors who breach the code of conduct which, inter\r\nalia, may result in their suspension or removal\nfrom office\n– although the council\r\nmay not suspend or remove them: that may only be done by the MEC\n9\n).\r\nMoreover, no steps were taken to recover the wasteful expenditure\r\nfrom them under the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of\n2003.\n[7]\tSection 53(3) of the Act provides for members of an\r\nexecutive committee who are removed from office to be replaced by way\r\nof\nan election ‘subject to section 43’. The effect of\r\nthis is that the ANC was entitled to have two councillors elected\nto\r\nfill the vacancies created by the removal of councillors Mabuyakhulu\r\nand Khumalo in order to reflect the proportional representation\nof\r\nthe parties in the council. Obdurately, the ANC caucus in the council\r\nnominated councillors Mabuyakhulu and Khumalo once again\nfor election\r\nto fill those vacancies. The majority of the council refused to elect\r\nthem and the ANC councillors, in turn, refused\nto put up any other\r\ncandidates for election. This resulted in a state of deadlock but, as\r\nthe three remaining members of the executive\ncommittee constituted a\r\nquorum, the executive committee continued about its work –\r\nalbeit without ANC representation.\n[8]\tFaced with this situation, the MEC adopted the\r\nposition that the council had enjoyed no right to refuse to approve\r\nwhoever the\nANC nominated to the executive committee. When the\r\ncouncil refused to back down the MEC, relying upon s 139(1) of\r\nthe Constitution\nwhich authorises a provincial executive to intervene\r\nwhen a municipality ‘cannot or does not fulfil an executive\r\nobligation\nin terms of the Constitution or legislation’,\r\nproposed a resolution to the provincial executive council of\r\nKwaZulu-Natal\nthat either an administrator be appointed to run an\r\nelection aimed at the installation of the ANC’s nominees as\r\nmembers of\nthe executive committee of the first respondent’s\r\ncouncil or, alternatively, that the first respondent’s council\r\nbe\ndissolved and fresh elections held with the first respondent’s\r\nfunctions being performed by the administrator until a new\ncouncil\r\nwas established.\n[9]\tThe MEC’s proposal was accepted by the\r\nprovincial executive council on 26 June 2008. Faced with this, the\r\nfirst respondent\nlaunched an application in the Pietermaritzburg High\r\nCourt challenging the provincial executive’s power to intervene\r\nin its\naffairs. As a result, on 14 July 2008 a rule nisi returnable\r\non 15 August 2008 was issued calling upon the premier of the province\n\nof KwaZulu-Natal and certain other parties to show cause why the\r\nresolution of the executive council should not be declared invalid\n\nand why the provincial executive should not be interdicted from\r\nintervening in the council’s affairs as it had resolved to\ndo.\n[10]\tSection 139(2) of the Constitution provides that if\r\na provincial executive intervenes in a municipality’s affairs,\r\nit\nis to give written notice of the intervention to the national\r\nminister responsible for local government affairs. The national\r\nexecutive\ndisapproved of the provincial executive’s\r\nintervention which thus came to naught and the interdict was never\r\nargued to finality.\nPresumably, the rule nisi lapsed with the\r\neffluxion of time.\n[11]\tNotwithstanding this, the ANC councillors in the\r\nfirst respondent’s council persisted in their refusal to\r\nnominate anyone\nexcept councillors Mabuyakhulu and Khumalo to fill\r\nthe two vacancies on the executive committee. At a council meeting on\r\n23 March\n2009, a secret ballot was held in respect of the seat on the\r\nexecutive committee reserved for a minority party which was to be\r\nfilled by a councillor from either the Democratic Alliance (the\r\nfourth respondent) or the Federated Congress (the fifth respondent)\n\nwho had an equal entitlement to it. After this election had been\r\nheld, the ANC was again afforded the opportunity to nominate two\nof\r\nits councillors to sit on the executive committee. Once more, an ANC\r\ncouncillor submitted the names of councillors Mabuyakhulu\nand\r\nKhumalo, this time subject to a condition that they be appointed with\r\neffect from 1 May 2008. Whether this condition vitiated\nthe validity\r\nof the nomination is not necessary to consider for purposes of this\r\njudgment. What is of importance is that once the\nnomination had been\r\nmade, a councillor representing the Democratic Alliance stated that\r\nthe council’s resolution on the removal\nof those councillors\r\nfrom the executive committee still stood and that, in those\r\ncircumstances, the nomination was not acceptable.\nAlthough it is not\r\ndisputed that the majority of the full council voted in favour of\r\nthis view, it has never been contended by\nany party to these\r\nproceedings that the ANC was not entitled to nominate the two\r\ncouncillors concerned and, in truth, the events\nof this meeting\r\namount to no more than a refusal to elect those whom the ANC had\r\nnominated (as was correctly accepted by counsel\nfor the appellant).\n[12]\tIt was in these circumstances that the MEC again\r\ndecided to intervene. This he did on 7 April 2009 by launching the\r\nproceedings\npresently on appeal by way of a notice of motion seeking,\r\ninter alia, the following relief:\n‘\n2.1\tTHAT it be and is\r\nhereby declared that in terms of\nSection 43\nof the\nLocal Government:\nMunicipal Structures Act No. 117 of 1998\nread with Section 160 of the\r\nConstitution:-\n2.1.1\teach party or interest to\r\nbe represented on the Executive Committee of a Municipal Council is\r\nentitled to be represented pro\nrata to its representation in the\r\nMunicipal Council;\n2.1.2\teach party or interest\r\naforesaid is entitled to choose and nominate any sitting Municipal\r\nCouncillor to be elected to the\nExecutive Committee;\n2.1.3\ta Municipal Council is\r\nobliged to accept and elect those sitting Municipal Councillors\r\nchosen and nominated by the party or\ninterest as aforesaid.\n2.2\tTHAT the refusal by the\r\nMunicipal Council of First Respondent to accept the two nominated\r\ncandidates from Third Respondent for\nelection to the Executive\r\nCommittee of First Respondent at its meeting held at Madadeni on\r\nMonday 23\nrd\nMarch 2009 be and is hereby declared to be\r\nunlawful.\n2.3\tTHAT Third Respondent is\r\nentitled to nominate for election any two sitting Municipal\r\nCouncillors of First Respondent of its\nchoice to the two positions\r\nreserved for Third Respondent on the Executive Committee and the\r\nMunicipal Council is thereupon obliged\nto elect them to the Executive\r\nCommittee.’\n[13]\tParagraph 2.1.1 of the notice of motion is,\r\neffectively, a restatement of the provisions of s 43(2) of the Act\r\nand relates\nto an issue about which there has never been a dispute.\r\nIn these circumstances declaratory relief in those terms in\r\nunnecessary\nand was not sought by appellant’s counsel.\r\nSimilarly, the relief set out in paragraph 2.1.2 of the notice of\r\nmotion is also\nunnecessary as there has never been a dispute as to\r\nthe entitlement of any party or interest represented in the municipal\r\ncouncil\nto nominate a councillor for election to the executive\r\ncommittee. Paragraph 2.2, which was formulated in the light of what\r\noccurred\nat the meeting of 23 March 2009, is also unnecessary as\r\nessentially all that occurred at that meeting was a refusal to elect.\r\nCounsel\nfor the appellant therefore correctly confined his argument\r\nto the relief set out in paragraphs 2.1.3 and 2.3 in the notice of\r\nmotion which, essentially, amounts to the same thing viz that the ANC\r\nwas entitled to nominate any two of its municipal councillors\nin the\r\nfirst respondent for the two vacancies on the executive committee,\r\nincluding those councillors whose removal had caused\nthe vacancies in\r\nthe first place, and that the council was thereupon obliged to accept\r\nsuch persons onto that committee.\n[14]\tIn advancing this contention,\r\nthe appellant placed particular emphasis on s 160(8) of the\r\nConstitution which provides both\nthat parties and interests reflected\r\nwithin the municipal council are to be ‘fairly represented’\n10\nand that\nmembers\r\nof a municipal council ‘are entitled to participate in its\r\nproceedings and those of its committees in a manner that\n. . . is\r\nconsistent with democracy’.\n11\nAs was stressed in\nDemocratic\r\nAlliance & another v Masondo NO & another\n,\n12\nthese provisions are designed\r\nto ensure that minority parties can meaningfully participate in the\r\ndeliberative processes of municipal\ncouncils and its committees. This\r\nobjective the legislature clearly sought to achieve in s 43(2) of the\r\nAct by providing for proportional\nrepresentation in the executive\r\ncommittee of the parties and interests represented in the council.\n[15]\tThe appellant argued that s\r\n43(1) of the Act, which requires a municipal council to ‘elect’\r\ncouncillors onto its\nexecutive committee, is to be interpreted in the\r\nlight of these constitutional values and that, in doing so, democracy\r\ncan only\nbe given its full voice if the word ‘elect’ in\r\nthat section is not given the narrow sense of a decision taken by way\n\nof a majority vote, as to do so could result in a majority of the\r\ncouncil, in effect, deciding for a minority party who was to\n\nrepresent it in the committee and denying it its representative of\r\nchoice. This, so the argument went, was anti-democratic and\nled to\r\nunfair representation in the executive committee – and could,\r\nfor example, lead to a minority party’s most competent\n\ncouncillors being excluded from participation in a council’s\r\nexecutive processes. Consequently, the word ‘elect’\n\nshould be interpreted widely to connote ‘select’ in the\r\nsense that the council is obliged to accept the councillor\nput\r\nforward by a party entitled to have a councillor in the executive\r\ncommittee. Accordingly, so the argument continued, as the\ntwo\r\ncouncillors concerned had not been sanctioned by removal from the\r\nmunicipal council, they were in the same position as all\nother\r\nsitting councillors and were to be ‘elected’ in the wide\r\nsense if nominated by the ANC for the two vacant posts.\n[16]\tThe immediate difficulty that I\r\nhave with this argument is that it appears to fly in the face of the\r\nConstitution itself, s\n160(1)(c) of which provides for a municipal\r\ncouncil to ‘elect an executive committee’ subject to\r\nnational legislation\n(which in the present case is clearly the Act).\r\nAll questions concerning the passing of by-laws, the approval of\r\nbudgets, the imposition\nof rates and other taxes, levies and duties,\r\nand the raising of loans, are to be determined by a decision taken by\r\na municipal\ncouncil with the supporting vote of the majority of its\r\nmembers.\n13\nSection 160(3)(c) goes on to provide that al other questions before a\r\nmunicipal council – which includes the election of\nan executive\r\ncommittee – are to be ‘decided by a majority of the votes\r\ncast’. The appellant’s suggestion\nthat the Act should be\r\ninterpreted to mean that a municipal council was obliged to accept a\r\ndecision taken by another on who should\nbe a member of its executive\r\ncommittee, is wholly inconsistent with this constitutional\r\nrequirement.\n[17]\tMoreover, in my view, a\r\nrequirement that the members of the executive committee of a\r\nmunicipal council be elected by a majority\nof the members of that\r\ncouncil does not do violence to democracy or the underlying values of\r\nthe Constitution. An essential element\nof democracy is that effect be\r\ngiven to the will of the majority. This was emphasised\nby the Constitutional Court in\nMasondo\n.\r\nThe issue in that case was whether mayoral committees established\r\nunder s 60 of the Act are ‘committees of municipal councils’\n\nas contemplated by s 160(8) of the Constitution. The majority\r\nconcluded that they were not whereas O’Regan J in a minority\n\njudgment concluded otherwise. Writing for the majority, Langa DCJ\r\nstated that democratic and accountable government for local\r\ncommunities\n14\n‘involves ensuring that the will of the majority prevails and\r\nalso that the views of the minority are considered’\n15\n– the latter being achieved by members of the executive\r\ncommittee being ‘representative of minority parties and\r\ninterests’.\n16\nO’Regan J expressed a similar view. Although differing from the\r\nmajority in regard to its applicability to mayoral committees,\nshe\r\nobserved that s 160(8) of the Constitution entitled councillors in\r\nmunicipal councils to participate in the proceedings of\nthe council\r\nand its committees subject to parties and interests being fairly\r\nrepresented therein and that the principle of fair\nrepresentation\r\n‘remains subject to democracy (which implies that the majority\r\nmust always be able to determine decisions)’.\n17\nShe continued:\n18\n‘\nMoreover,\r\ns 160(8)(b) is clear that the principle of fair representation is\r\nalways subject to democracy and the will of the majority.\nMembers of\r\nthe mayoral committee must therefore submit to that principle, as\r\nmust all councillors.\nThe\r\nprinciple established by s 160(8) is a principle which requires\r\ninclusive deliberation prior to decision-making to enrich the\n\nqualities of our democracy. It does not subvert the principle of\r\ndemocracy itself\n’\r\n(emphasis added).\n[18]\tUnder s 151(2) of the\r\nConstitution, the executive authority of the municipality vests in\r\nits council. The first respondent\nhas a ‘collective executive\r\nsystem’ as referred to in the Act and s 43(2) of the Act, which\r\nmandates the proportional\nrepresentation of the parties and interests\r\nin the municipal council in the membership of its executive committee\r\nwhich exercises\nthe council’s executive authority. This\r\nadvances the values of a multi-party system of democratic government\r\nin accordance\nwith one of the founding values enshrined in s 1 of the\r\nConstitution. But it is the participation of minority parties in the\r\nexecutive\ncommittee which does so, not the participation of any\r\nparticular individual. The selection of the persons to act on that\r\ncommittee\nhas been entrusted to the municipal council, and it is\r\nclear from both the majority and minority judgments in\nMasondo\nthat a system whereby a majority vote of councillors is used to\r\ndetermine the members of a municipal executive committee is in\nno way\r\nundemocratic. It allows a minority party to put forward its\r\ncandidates and its views to be heard and considered as to their\n\nsuitability to be elected. It also ensures that the will of the\r\nmajority shall prevail: and that is the hallmark of democracy.\nOn the\r\nother hand, the same cannot be said of the interpretation put forward\r\nby the appellant viz. that the majority of a municipal\ncouncil is\r\nobliged to accept the views of a minority on a crucial issue such as\r\nthe suitability of a person to be entrusted with\nthe conduct of the\r\nexecutive functions of a municipality.\n[19\n]\tAnother\r\nmajor difficulty I have with the appellant’s argument is that\r\nit does violence to the language used by the legislature.\nWhile the\r\nambit of interpretation is to give effect to the object or purpose of\r\nthe legislation under consideration, in doing so\nthe words used must\r\nbe given their ordinary grammatical meaning unless to do so would\r\nlead to an absurdity that the legislature\ncould not have\r\ncontemplated. This court has previously observed that ‘it is\r\nnot the function of the court to do violence\nto the language of a\r\nstatute and impose its views on what the policy or object of the\r\nmeasure should be’.\n19\nAnd although a court must always be mindful of the values on which\r\nthe Constitution is based and which it seeks to advance, if\nthe\r\nlanguage in a statutory enactment ‘is ignored in favour of a\r\ngeneral resort to “values” the result is not\n\ninterpretation but divination’.\n20\n[20]\tThe interpretation that the appellant seeks to\r\nplace upon s 43(1) cannot be reconciled with the ordinary grammatical\r\nmeaning\nof the words used by the legislature. It provides that ‘.\r\n. . if the council of a municipality establishes an executive\r\ncommittee,\nit\nmust elect a number of councillors necessary for\r\neffective and efficient government’. Not only do the words\r\n‘elect’\n(used in the section) and ‘select’\r\n(advanced by the appellant) both have as their ordinary accepted\r\nmeaning a connotation\nof choice (and in that regard the appellant’s\r\nargument is but a play on words) but, most importantly, the section\r\nvests the\nchoice of members of the executive committee in the\r\nmunicipal council and not in a party or interest represented in that\r\ncouncil.\nFurthermore, s 45 of the Act requires this election to take\r\nplace at a meeting of the council. The obligatory rubber stamping of\n\nan earlier decision taken by a party as to who should represent it on\r\nthe executive committee, as the appellant argued should occur\n(for\r\nwhich the legislature could simply have provided if that had been its\r\nintention), can hardly be construed as an election by\nthe council at\r\na council meeting. The interpretation which the appellant wishes to\r\nplace on s 43(1) is more than just strained.\nIt simply is not what\r\nthe words of the section, given their ordinary grammatical meaning,\r\nconnote. A court has no power to legislate,\nand it would require a\r\nrewriting of the section to convey what, in the appellant’s\r\nview, the legislature ought to have provided.\n[21]\tSignificantly, appellant’s counsel conceded\r\nthat at times there might have to be an election in what he called\r\nthe ‘narrow\nsense’, involving a decision taken by a\r\nmajority vote of members of the executive committee. This would of\r\ncourse occur when,\nfor example, two parties in a council had an equal\r\nclaim to an available seat on the committee (as indeed occurred on\r\n23 March\n2009 when the council voted on whether the fourth or\r\nfifth respondent’s candidate should be elected to the\r\ncommittee, as\nalready mentioned). It would also be necessary if a\r\nparty nominated more candidates than the number of seats to which it\r\nis entitled;\nand while that may be unlikely to occur, it cannot be\r\nexcluded. Other examples spring readily to mind. The fact remains\r\nthat in\ncertain circumstances there clearly will have to be an\r\nelection of members of the executive council by way of a majority\r\nvote.\nThe legislature can hardly be presumed to have intended the\r\nword ‘elect’ in that sense to apply only in certain\r\ncircumstances\nand not in others, particularly when it failed to\r\nspecify in what circumstances there was to be an election or, as\r\nargued by the\nappellant, a mere nomination of committee members.\n[22]\tIt is also not without significance that the\r\nlegislature used the word ‘elect’ in the sense of a\r\ndecision by a\nmajority vote elsewhere in the Act. Thus a municipal\r\ncouncil is required by s 36 to elect its speaker and by s 48 to elect\r\nits\nmayor and deputy by way of a majority vote in the manner set out\r\nin schedule 3. It may reasonably be inferred that the legislature\n\nused the same word in the same sense throughout the same enactment,\r\nparticularly in relation to similar matters. There is no reason\nto\r\nthink that, in using the word ‘elect’ in relation to the\r\nelection of members of the executive committee in s 43(1),\nit\r\nintended it to bear another, wholly different meaning in relation to\r\nthe election of other municipal office bearers.\n[23]\tFinally, that the ultimate choice of who should be\r\non the executive committee vests in the council, and not in a party\r\nor interest\nrepresented in the council, is reinforced by s 53(1) of\r\nthe Act which provides for the removal of a member of the executive\r\ncommittee\nby way of council resolution after notice of such a\r\nresolution has been given. This provides a clear indication that the\r\nlegislature\nintended the council to determine whether any particular\r\nperson should be on its executive committee. If a minority party\r\ncould\nmerely override the majority of a municipal council by\r\nre-nominating a councillor removed from the executive committee, not\r\nonly\nwould it have the absurd result of negating the power extended\r\nto the council under s 53(1) of the Act but it would nullify the\n\ncouncil’s constitutional and democratic right to determine who\r\nshould be on that committee.\n[24]\tIn the light of all these considerations, it is\r\nclear that the council was vested with the choice to determine who\r\nshould be\non its executive committee, and that the members of that\r\ncommittee are to be appointed by way of a majority vote. The word\r\n‘elect’\nin s 43(1) of the Act is to be ascribed that\r\nmeaning rather than that which the appellant puts forward. The court\r\na quo correctly\ndetermined the issue against the appellant, and the\r\nappeal must fail.\n[25]\tThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n_________________\nL E LEACH\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANTS:  \t\tA J Dickson SC; A A Gabriel\nInstructed by PKX Attorneys, Pietermaritzburg\nMcIntyre and Van der Post, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT:\t\tP J Olsen SC\nInstructed by De Jager Baqwa Maritz Inc\nc/o Tatham Wilkes, Pietermaritzburg\nSymington and De Kok, Bloemfontein\n1\nSection 18(1) of the Act.\n2\nSection 19 of the Act.\n3\nSection 36(1) and (2) of the Act.\n4\nSet out in s 44 of the Act.\n5\nSection 43(3) ensures compliance with\ns\r\n\t160(8)(a) of the Constitution which provides that members of a\r\n\tmunicipal council are entitled to participate in the proceedings\nits\r\n\tcommittees in a manner that ‘allows parties and interests\r\n\treflected within the Council to be fairly represented’.\n6\nSection 48(1) of the Act requires the municipal\r\n\tcouncil to elect a member of its executive committee as the mayor\r\n\tand, if the\nMEC for local government of the province so approves,\r\n\tanother member of the executive committee as the deputy mayor.\n7\nSection 36 of the Act obliges every municipal council to have a\r\n\tchairperson, to be called ‘the speaker’.

    "facts": "A political dispute arose in the Amajuba District Municipality council after two ANC councillors, DB Mabuyakhulu and JCN Khumalo, were removed from the municipal executive committee. The ANC nominated the same two councillors to fill the vacancies, but the council, now controlled by a coalition of the IFP and a former ANC ally, refused to elect them. The MEC for Local Government, Housing and Traditional Affairs sought a declaratory order to compel the council to accept the nominations, arguing that section 43 of the Municipal Structures Act and constitutional provisions required proportional representation. The High Court dismissed the application and the MEC appealed.",
    "issues": "1. Whether a municipal council must elect the councillors nominated by a party entitled to representation on the executive committee, or may refuse such nominations. 2. The proper interpretation of section 43(1) of the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act in light of section 160 of the Constitution. 3. Whether the MEC could intervene under section 139(1) of the Constitution to force the council’s compliance.",
    "principles": "Section 43(1) requires the council to \"elect\" members of the executive committee, which, according to the Constitution’s s 160(3)(c), is decided by a majority vote. s 43(2) mandates proportional representation, not the automatic acceptance of party nominations. Constitutional interpretation must give words their ordinary grammatical meaning unless absurdity results. Precedent in Masondo clarified that democratic decision‑making by majority does not violate the requirement for fair representation of minority parties.",
    "application": "The Court held that the word \"elect\" in s 43(1) carries its ordinary meaning of a majority decision at a council meeting. Consequently, the council was not obliged to rubber‑stamp the ANC’s nominations; it could refuse them and decide by vote. The MEC’s reliance on s 139(1) was rejected because provincial intervention is only permissible when a municipality cannot fulfil its executive obligations, not merely to enforce a party’s nomination. The statutory scheme, reinforced by s 53(1) which allows council removal of committee members, confirms that the council retains ultimate authority over committee composition.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The council’s refusal to elect the nominated ANC councillors was upheld, and the MEC’s application for a declaratory order was denied."
