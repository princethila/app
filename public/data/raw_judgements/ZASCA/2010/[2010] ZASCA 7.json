Their convictions and sentences are set\naside.\n2.\tThe appeals of appellants 1, 5 and 6 are dismissed.\n________________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\n________________________________________________________________\nMLAMBO\nJA\n(Mpati P and Nugent JA concurring):\n[1]\tThe seven appellants were arraigned with seven\nothers in the Brits Regional Court on a number of charges, but were\nconvicted only\non a charge of public violence. The first and second\nappellants were sentenced to six yearsâ imprisonment, two years of\nwhich were\nsuspended for five years on certain conditions. The other\nappellants were also sentenced to six yearsâ imprisonment but in\ntheir\ncase three years were suspended for five years on similar\nconditions. The appellants were unsuccessful in an appeal against\ntheir\nconvictions and sentences to the North Gauteng High Court,\nPretoria (Seriti and Ledwaba JJ). That court, however, granted them\nleave\nto appeal to this court against their convictions and\nsentences.\n[2]\tAs to the other seven persons originally charged\nwith the appellants, one of them, Sydney Douglas Keyser, pleaded\nguilty to a\ncharge of public violence at the commencement of the\ntrial, and was consequently convicted on that charge and sentenced to\nsix yearsâ\nimprisonment, four of which were suspended also on\ncertain conditions. He then turned state witness. Two others had\ncharges withdrawn\nagainst them and two more were discharged at the\nclose of the stateâs case.\n1\nOf the remaining two one was acquitted on all charges at the\nconclusion of the trial and the other was successful in the appeal to\nthe North Gauteng High Court.\n[3]\tThe incident giving rise to the matter took place\nsome 13 years ago, on 17 June 1996 to be exact, at\nHartebeespoort\nin Gauteng at a restaurant known as Tant Malieâs. On\nthat day, a public holiday, the restaurant was packed to the brim\nwith patrons,\nincluding children, enjoying themselves and having a\ngood time when a fight erupted. In the ensuing fight, which escalated\ninto several\nother fights engulfing the whole restaurant, a number of\npatrons were assaulted and restaurant furniture and utensils were\ndamaged.\nThe appellants who were present at the scene and others,\nalleged to have been with them, were implicated as the perpetrators\nof these\nacts. The charges brought against them included attempted\nmurder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, malicious\ndamage\nto property and theft.\n[4]\tIn this appeal the appellants have raised\nessentially two issues against their convictions. The first is that\nthe incident on\nwhich their convictions are based was not of such a\nmagnitude as to amount to public violence. The second is that the\nstate had failed\nto adduce evidence linking them to any act of\nassociation in the commission of any transgression alleged to have\nbeen committed on\nthe day in question. In relation to sentence it was\ncontended that the trial court had misdirected itself when it turned\ndown the\nappellantsâ application for a postponement which, they\nassert, was aimed at obtaining pre-sentence reports for purposes of\nbringing\ncertain facts to the attention of that court for its\nconsideration before imposing sentence.\n[5]\tAt the outset, and in view of the appellantsâ\nargument that the incident we are concerned with was not so serious\nas to amount\nto public violence, it is apposite to consider what\nconstitutes that offence. Public violence is described by Snyman\n2\nas follows:\nâ\nPublic violence consists in\nthe unlawful and intentional commission, together with a number of\npeople, of an act or acts which assume\nserious dimensions and which\nare intended forcibly to disturb public peace and tranquillity or to\ninvade the rights of others.â\nThis description of the offence is no different in\nsubstance to that also proffered by Milton.\n3\nIt is apparent from this definition that the salient features of the\noffence are that a group of persons, acting in concert must\nbe shown\nto have committed an act or acts of sufficiently serious dimensions\nwhich invaded the rights of others and disturbed public\npeace.\n4\n[6]\tThe most recent case heard in this court featuring\npublic violence is\nS v Whitehead\n.\n5\nIn that matter a group of men assembled at a pre-arranged spot, and\nfinalised a plan to attack workers and members of a union who\nwere on\nstrike. From their meeting these men then ran towards the strikers\nwho had by that time assembled at a nearby park. What\nfollowed was an\nindiscriminate attack on the unsuspecting workers accompanied by the\ndamage and destruction of property, notably\nmotor vehicle\nwindscreens. The conviction of public violence on these facts was not\nchallenged on appeal.\n[7]\tWith this exposition of what constitutes the offence\nof public violence I turn to consider what happened in the case\nbefore us.\nThe restaurant at which the incident took place is made up\nin the first instance of a bar, a conventional shop as well as a gift\nshop where typically South African wares are on offer. Then there is\nan upper level catering for conventional restaurant services\nwhere\nmeals are served. There is also an area in the outdoors of the\npremises divided into what is called the Bosveld, Luiperd and\nLaeveld\nlapas. These lapas are arranged into 41 specially constructed braai\nareas which cater for anything from five to 30 patrons\nat a time.\nThere are also stables on the premises where horses were apparently\nkept. The restaurant appears, on the record before\nus, to be a\nfavourite venue for family occasions such as birthday celebrations\nand is popular with locals and tourists alike.\n[8]\tIn what follows I set out an undisputed version of\nwhat transpired. According to this version a group of big and well\nbuilt men,\nmostly with clean shaven heads, set upon and attacked\nrestaurant patrons and committed a variety of other transgressions at\nthe restaurant.\nThis group is also said to have been identifiable by\nthe dark windbreakers that they wore. There is no dispute that the\nspark that\nignited the mayhem occurred at the horse stables. This was\nwhen appellant no 7 (Danny Schone) mounted or attempted to mount a\nhorse\nbackwards and was seen in the process fooling around with its\ntail. This conduct prompted a patron occupying one of the braai areas\nin that vicinity to make a remark about his antics. The nature of the\nremark was undisputedly innocuous and is alleged to have been\nalong\nthe following lines: âHow can he do thatâ. The patron who made\nthis remark was part of the Jamieson family which came to\nbe known in\nthe trial as the Jamiesons, who had come to the restaurant to\ncelebrate Mr Shaun Jamiesonâs birthday. The remark apparently\nemanated from Shaun Jamiesonâs brother-in-law, Mr Hannes van Wyk,\nand it was apparently heard by Schone and some of his friends\nwho\nthen as a group proceeded to surround the Jamiesons. Some of the\nappellants were in that surrounding group and one of them uttered\nwords to the effect of âcome boys lets boxâ where after one of\nthem proceeded to assault Hannes van Wyk with fists despite the\nlatterâs placatory efforts. Shaun\nJamieson\ntried to come to his brother-in-lawâs rescue but was himself pulled\nfrom behind by his shirt and was then punched in his\nface which\ncaused him to fall whereafter he was kicked several times.\n[9]\tWhen the assault on Hannes van Wyk and Shaun\nJamieson ceased, the group of attackers moved on and some of them\nwere observed assaulting\npatrons they encountered along the way.\nShaun Jamieson saw this group upending tables, breaking glasses and\nthrowing chairs around.\nThe group was then seen breaking up into\nsmaller groups which continued assaulting any patron they\nencountered. This escalated into\nfull scale chaos engulfing the whole\nrestaurant with accompanying screaming, shouting and confusion. In\nthe ensuing mayhem patrons,\npetrified of being assaulted, tried to\nkeep away from the marauding attackers whilst others, who\nunfortunately found themselves in\nthe vicinity of the conflict, were\nbeaten up. The whole place by all accounts was virtually turned\nupside down. In the aftermath\nof the chaos there were patrons who\nwere bleeding from the beating they had received, some of whom\nrequired medical attention.\n[10]\tFrom the evidence presented by the state certain\nincidents which played themselves out amidst the chaos, stand out and\nit is\nnecessary to refer to them. The first one is the Jamieson\nincident I have alluded to during which Hannes van Wyk and Shaun\nJamieson\nwere assaulted. Another incident is an incident where a big\nman was observed assaulting a much smaller man. This prompted one of\nthe patrons, Mrs Diana McClelland, to throw a can at the big man, in\nan effort to stop the assault. It is common cause that the can\nhit\nsomeone who thereafter swore at McClelland. I will return to this\nincident later in this judgment when dealing with the issue\nwhether\nthe can hit the attacker or not.\n[11]\tAnother incident is the so-called Serfontein and\nSchutte incident. The evidence is that Dr Serfontein and Mr Schutte\nand their\nwives were also at the restaurant to celebrate a birthday.\nThey heard some noises and Dr Serfontein and Mr Schutte then\nleft\nto investigate what was happening after telling their families\nto hide in a small room. They then found themselves surrounded by\na\ngroup of men and one of them assaulted Dr Serfontein with a sjambok.\nThey managed to leave the area and proceeded to their vehicles\nwhere\nDr Serfontein took a jacket. On their way back Dr Serfontein was\nagain attacked by approximately four men. When Schutte\ntried to\nassist Dr Serfontein he was also assaulted and lost consciousness. He\nregained consciousness when order had returned and\nrequired surgery\nfor his wounds.\n[12]\tThere was also the incident that occurred outdoors\nwhere a man was assaulted by a group of men. It appears that every\ntime this\nman was assaulted he fell backwards against a tree which\nthrew him back towards the attackers and this unleashed continuous\nbeatings.\nThen there was an encounter between Mrs Alberts, the owner\nof the restaurant, and one of the men who shouted at her that his men\nwould close down the place. Another encounter occured between the\nsame man and Mr van der Watt, Mrs Albertâs friend who was assisting\nher to run the restaurant on that day, where the same threats were\nmade. Perhaps the most graphic, yet conclusive, evidence of the\nsituation came from Van der Watt. I can do no better than quote his\ntestimony to the effect that:\nâ\nOns het gevoel soos\ngyselaars. Ons kon nÃªrens heen beweeg nie. Ons was te bang. Ons\nvryheid van beweging was ontneem want jy was\nte bang loop jy nie jou\nweer vas in een van die mense nie.â\nAnd further:\nâ\nNee, dit was vir my meer as\naanranding. Dit was soos ân aanval. Dit was nie vir my asof daar ân\nbakleiery van weerskante was nie.\nEk het dit nou genoem die term,\nbakleiery maar die aggressie, die aanval het definitief van hierdie\ngroep gekom want die ander, die\nvrou het nog gepleit: âMoenie my\nman slaan nieâ.â\nThis evidence was uncontradicted. It is clear, in my\nview, that the drama that unfolded at the restaurant on that day was\na rowdy,\nviolent and bloody confrontation in addition to which\nwindows, shop wares and furniture were either upended and/or broken\nand that\nthe public peace was seriously disturbed.\n[13]\tThe mayhem was so pronounced that the first law\nenforcement officers on the scene, Sergeant Olson and Inspector\nMadia, followed\nby Corporal du Bruyn, were unable to bring the\nsituation under control and restore order until sometime later with\nthe arrival of\nreinforcements. Perhaps one must also refer to an\nincident that occurred on the arrival of Olson. He was confronted by\na big man\nwho was part of the mayhem perpetrators. This man\napproached Olson menacingly with one of his hands behind his back.\nThe significance\nof this confrontation is that the manâs demeanour\ntowards Olson was perceived to be one of aggression and was thought\nto have a\nweapon in his concealed hand. Needless to say but Olson\nbecame apprehensive when he was confronted in this fashion. Olson and\nMadia\nalso observed small groups of men, from which the one who\nconfronted Olson emerged, attacking individual patrons. They observed\nthat\na majority of patrons were barricaded inside the restaurant and\nthat any patron who stumbled outside the restaurant was set upon\nby a\ngroup comprising anything from two to five men. With the arrival of\nreinforcements they were able to move in between the groups\nand\nrescue the patrons caught up in the fracas. Eventually the group of\nattackers left the scene and this resulted in a cessation\nof the\nchaos.\n[14]\tAll this evidence demonstrates conclusively, in my\nview, that the incident we are dealing with reached public violence\ndimensions\nand that the finding by the trial court that this offence\nwas committed on that day is fully justified. A further useful\nindicator\nthat public violence was committed is the number of\nincidents described by the witnesses.\n[15]\tThis leads me to the next and primary issue in the\nappeal and that is whether the appellants were correctly convicted of\nhaving\ncommitted any acts of public violence or associated themselves\nwith the transgressions committed on that day. The appellants do not\ndispute that at some stage there was trouble at the restaurant but\nthey deny planning and/or being complicit in any criminal conduct\ncommitted there on that day. Their version which was accepted by the\ntrial court was that they had planned beforehand to spend the\nafternoon at some other place in Buffelspoort to celebrate Sydney\nKeyserâs birthday. This plan changed, however, when those\ntravelling\nahead in their motorbike convoy decided, as they went past\nTant Malieâs, that they would rather celebrate Keyserâs birthday\nthere.\nThey then proceeded to redirect others in their convoy to the\nrestaurant as well as recall those who had already gone past.\n[16]\tIn convicting the appellants the trial court\naccepted the appellantsâ version that they had no prior plan to be\nat the restaurant\nbut reasoned that as they were\npresent at the restaurant, they had\nacted in consent and their actions assumed serious dimensions which\ndisturbed the public peace\nand order. On this basis the trial court\nconcluded that they had committed the offence of public violence and\nconvicted them accordingly.\nThis conclusion was upheld by the North\nGauteng High Court.\n[17]\tIn\nS v Mgedezi\n1989 (1) SA 687\n(A) this court dealt with a situation where there was\nno prior plan to commit the offence of public violence. It was stated\nthere\nthat a general and all embracing approach regarding all those\ncharged is not permissible. It was stated further that the conduct\nof\nthe individual accused should be individually considered with a view\nto determining whether there is a sufficient basis for holding\nthat a\nparticular accused person is liable on the ground of active\nparticipation in the achievement of a common purpose that developed\nat the scene. In that case the following was stated:\n6\nâ\nA view of the totality of the\ndefence cases cannot legitimately be used as a brush with which to\ntar each accused individually, nor\nas a means of rejecting the\ndefence versions\nen\nmasse\n.â\nAnd further:\n7\nâ\nThe trial Court was obliged\nto consider, in relation to each individual accused whose evidence\ncould properly be rejected as false,\nthe facts found proved by the\nState evidence against that accused, in order to assess whether there\nwas a sufficient basis for holding\nthat accused liable on the ground\nof active participation in the achievement of a common purpose. The\ntrial Courtâs failure to\nundertake this task again constituted a\nserious misdirection.â\n[18]\tIn argument before us it was\nsubmitted on behalf of all the appellants that the state had failed\nto prove any act of association\nby them with any transgression\ncommitted at the restaurant. The submission was that on this basis\nthe appeals against the appellantsâ\nconvictions had to succeed. It\nwas further submitted that there was no reliable evidence linking the\nappellants to any of the transgressions\nperpetrated at the\nrestaurant. In this regard it was submitted that in respect of J C le\nRoux in particular, he was uncontradicted\nin his assertion that he\nactively tried to stop the fracas and that he also tried to get his\ngroup out of the restaurant.\n[19]\tIt is clear in this matter that in convicting the\nappellants the trial courtâs premise was simply that as they were\nshown to\nhave been present at the scene they were therefore complicit\nin the commission of transgressions by other members of the group.\nThis,\non\nMgedeziâs\nauthority was a misdirection. In the absence of a prior agreement or\nplan to commit the transgressions mentioned the trial court\nwas\nrequired to conduct an investigation of each appellantâs conduct at\nthe scene so as to determine whether that appellant associated\nhimself with the acts of pubic violence. The trial court was also\nprimarily reliant on Keyserâs evidence in convicting the\nappellants.\nIn this regard, the trial court reasoned that as Keyser\nhad already been convicted and sentenced he stood to benefit nothing\nby falsely\nimplicating the appellants.\nKeyser\nwas an accomplice and his evidence against the appellants had to be\ntreated with caution. That caution was called for in this\ninstance is\nalso due to Keyserâs admitted animosity towards J C le\nRoux in particular. For this reason his evidence also\nrequired some\ncorroboration before being accepted. Clearly therefore the trial\ncourt committed a misdirection in failing to treat\nKeyserâs\nevidence with the necessary caution and in accepting it without the\nnecessary corroboration.\nIt\nis necessary therefore to consider all the evidence to determine the\ncomplicity, if any, of the appellants in the commission of\nany\ntransgression committed at the restaurant.\n[20]\tIn so far as appellant no 1\n(J C le Roux) is concerned, almost all the state witnesses testified\nand stated that he was visible\nas he appeared to play some leadership\nrole regarding the group that was terrorising other patrons. This\nobservation cannot be discounted\nin view of its corroboration by J C\nle Roux himself that some of the men in his group worked for him in\nhis security business. He\ntestified in this regard that seven of the\nmen charged with him were in his employ at the time of the incident\nincluding appellants\n3 (Anton Paul le Roux) and 4 (Willem le Roux)\nwho were also his younger brothers. Keyser also attested to this.\nThat J C le Roux\nalso recognised his leadership role is found in his\nversion that he was the one issuing instructions to his group to\neither desist\nfrom assaulting other patrons or to leave the\nrestaurant. Clearly J C le Roux was a prominent and unmistakeable\nfigure in the midst\nof the chaos.\n[21]\tJ C le Roux was implicated by\nKeyser to have been involved in the Jamieson incident I alluded to\nearlier. Keyser testified that\nwhen the fracas started around the\nJamiesons J C le Roux was the one who said to them, âcome boys lets\nboxâ or words to that\neffect. Shaun Jamieson identified him and\nappellant 2 (Timmy Nankervis) as being present in the group that\nsurrounded his family.\nHe could, however, not say that he saw J C le\nRoux do anything or assault anyone. He testified that it was this\nappellant who was\nissuing instructions to the others. He could,\nhowever, in stark contrast to Keyserâs evidence, not say if it was\nJ C le Roux who\nuttered the words âletâs boxâ. In so far as his\nwife, Juliana Jamieson is concerned, she identified the fourth\naccused\n8\nin the trial as the person who assaulted Van Wyk. It appears that in\nidentifying that accused (Lawrence Pike) she was under the impression\nthat she was identifying J C le Roux who had swopped positions with\nPike just before she came in to testify. She conceded that she\nwas\nmistaken in her identification when it was put to her in cross\nexamination that it was suspect. Her evidence must, for this reason,\nbe disregarded as being unreliable against J C le Roux. Clearly\ntherefore we have no evidence of this appellantâs complicity in\nthe\ntransgressions committed during the Jamieson incident.\n[22]\tJ C le Roux was also\nimplicated by Van der Watt and Alberts. Van der Watt testified that\nwhen he encountered this appellant,\nhe screamed abuse at him. He\nbecame very scared and requested this appellant and his group to\nleave but the latter demanded a refund\nof their money and threatened\nto burn the restaurant down. Van der Watt expressed the issued threat\nthus:\nâ\nDaardie groot persoon wat die\nbierblik gehad het. Wat ek as die leier aangesien het. Hulle het vir\nmy geskree dat:\nâ\nOns\ngaan julle toemaak. Ons gaan hierdie plek afbrand. Vannag gaan ons\nhierdie plek kool. Ons gaan hierdie plek afbreek tot die grond\ntoeâ.â\nHe also testified that J C le Roux\ngrabbed him by his throat and pinned him against the wall. J C le\nRoux did not deny the encounter\nwith Van der Watt, though he denied\nassaulting him. He also did not deny the threat attributed to him\nstating that this was his attempt\nto obtain a refund of the money\nthey had already paid and for which they had yet to be served. It is\nnot disputed that his screams\nat Van der Watt were heard by other\npatrons and added to the general pandemonium taking place there. The\nother incident where J C\nle Roux was implicated was his confrontation\nwith Mrs Alberts and where he again admittedly threatened to burn the\nplace down unless\nthey were refunded their monies. Alberts was\nunshaken in her identification of J C le Roux, saying that his face\nremained etched\nin her memory in view of her experience on the day of\nthe incident. Van der Watt and Alberts were unshaken in their\nimplication of\nJ C le Roux and I have no reason to doubt their\nevidence. Clearly this appellant was identified by these witnesses\ncommitting transgressions\nthat formed part and parcel of the\ncriminality taking place at the restaurant.\n[23]\tI now consider the can\nthrowing incident. McClelland is the witness who threw a can at a big\nman she saw assaulting a smaller\nman. She testified that she had\nheard a commotion and as the noise grew and when she looked for the\nsource of the noise she witnessed\nthis assault. She also saw a child\nand a woman screaming next to the scene of the assault. She testified\nthat she threw the can at\nthe big man who was assaulting the smaller\none basically to stop the assault. She could not, however, identify\nthe big man involved\nin the assault and she further conceded that she\nwas not sure if the can hit him. J C le Roux admitted that the can\nhit him but denied\nthat he was involved in any assault at the time.\n[24]\tMr\nCarl\nVictor Jeppe also testified about the same incident and he gave the\nsame evidence of a big man who was assaulting a smaller one\nand that\nhis sister-in-law, McClelland threw a can at the attacker. He saw the\ncan hit the attacker who then looked up and swore\nat McClelland. He\nalso testified that this big man had a beer mug in his hand which he\nthrew at McClelland but missed her. He further\nmentioned a child\nscreaming next to the scene of the assault. He mentioned that a woman\nhad tried to stop the assault by jumping\non the back of the big man\nbut was simply bundled away. Carl Jeppe identified J C le Roux as the\nman who was assaulting the smaller\none and further testified that\nthis appellant appeared to be the ring leader of the attackers.\nWhilst he maintained his identification\nof J C le Roux as the\nattacker, he conceded, however, that he could be mistaken between J C\nle Roux and appellant no 6 (Louis Rossouw)\nas to the man who\nperpetrated the assault. What is key however is that he (Carl Jeppe)\nwas unshaken in stating that the can hit the\nman who was assaulting\nanother.\n[25]\tIt is necessary to place the\ncan-throwing incident in proper context. This is in view of the\nsuggestion in argument that it occurred\nduring the Jamieson incident.\nShaun Jamieson and his wife said nothing about the man who was\nassaulting Hannes van Wyk being hit\nwith a can. Neither did they\nmention the presence of a screaming child or a woman who had jumped\non the back of that man.\n[26]\tWe know that in the Jamieson\nincident it was not only Hannes van Wyk who was assaulted, but Shaun\nJamieson too. From their vantage\npoint, McClelland and Carl Jeppe\nwould never have missed the assault on Shaun Jamieson. This analysis\ndemonstrates, beyond any doubt,\nthat when J C le Roux was hit with\nthe can it was not during the Jamieson incident. In the final\nanalysis J C le Rouxâs version\ndoes not, even remotely, suggest\nthat the can hit him during the Jamieson incident. It could also not\nhave been during J C le Rouxâs\nencounter with Van der Watt. Van der\nWatt did not observe what was observed by McClelland and Carl Jeppe,\nfor instance, the woman\nwho had jumped on the attackerâs back. This\nincident must therefore be one of those that played out during the\nchaos at the restaurant.\nIn my view, we cannot overlook McClellandâs\nevidence that she was moved to throwing the can to stop an attack on\nanother man. There\nwas therefore a clearly identifiable aggressor at\nwhom the can was aimed. That was J C le Roux.\n[27]\tThen there is the incident\ninvolving Olson who testified that J C le Roux confronted him\naggressively with his hand behind his\nback. He testified that as this\nappellant approached him in this manner he also challenged him\n(Olson) to shoot him. This, according\nto Olson, prompted him to hold\nhis firearm in such a way that he was ready for anything as he\nthought this appellant had a firearm.\nHe testified that when he asked\nthe appellant what the problem was the latter insulted him in return.\nHe described this appellantâs\ndemeanour as very aggressive.\nInspector Madia, who had arrived with Olson, corroborated Olsonâs\naccount of the encounter with J\nC le Roux. In my view, if one takes\naccount of the fact that Olson and Madia were the first law\nenforcement officers on the scene,\nfollowed by Du Bruyn and Traffic\nInspector Niemandt, and that they were unable to bring normality to\nthe situation mainly due to\nthe conduct of J C le Rouxâs group, his\nconduct towards Olson was in line with what other members of his\ngroup were doing.\n[28]\tWhat is significant about his\nbehaviour is that it was in the open and in full view of members of\nhis group and patrons alike.\nBoth Olson and Madia testified that\nmembers of J C le Rouxâs group brazenly continued to assault other\npatrons despite being aware\nof their presence as law enforcement\nofficers. The continuation of assaults in full view of the police\ndeals, in my view, a decisive\nblow to J C le Rouxâs version that he\ntried to diffuse the situation. Surely, one wonders why, if this is\ntrue, that the assaults\ncontinued unabated from the inside and\nspilled out into the open. In my view, J C le Rouxâs version should\nbe rejected as false.\nI accept as correct the evidence that he was\nprominent during the whole incident due to the leadership role he\nplayed in his group\nof attackers. In this regard Schutte, amongst\nothers, testified that this appellant was the apparent leader of the\ngroup of attackers\nand that he (Schutte) also witnessed him shouting\nat the police. It is important to take into account that it was his\ngroup that\nwas assaulting the other patrons and for him to behave as\ndescribed is in my view clear evidence of association with the\ntransgressions\ncommitted by members of his group. He was as complicit\nas his other members in disturbing the peace and invading the rights\nof others.\nOn this basis I conclude that his complicity in the\ncriminality of that day was proven beyond reasonable doubt and that\nhis conviction\nfor public violence must stand.\n[29]\nIn\nso far as Nankervis is concerned, Shaun Jamieson testified that he\nwas the one who had abused the horse and thereafter confronted\nhis\nbrother-in-law. As we know it was not Nankervis but Schone who was\ninvolved in the incident with the horse. Furthermore, it is\nclear\nthat Shaun Jamieson was mistaken that Nankervis was the one who\nassaulted his brother-in-law, as I will show when dealing with\nLouis\nRossouw who it was shown is the person who perpetrated that assault\nduring that incident. Shaun Jamieson did not implicate\nNankervis in\nany other transgression. Furthermore, no other witness implicated him\nsave for some oblique reference to him by Serfontein\nallegedly\nengaged in an argument with a patron. Nankervisâ\nversion regarding his clothing on the day (short pants) and his\ndenial of complicity in any of the transgressions was not\ncontradicted.\nAfter\nconsidering all the\nevidence it has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt that he\nassociated himself with the transgressions committed\non the day. For\nthis reason the appeal against his conviction should succeed.\n[30]\tAnton Paul le Roux was implicated by Keyser\nregarding an assault on a patron but no witness corroborated Keyser\nin this regard.\nThis appellant was also identified by Dr Serfontein\nas the person who assaulted him with a sjambok. In this regard,\nhowever, I must\nalso consider the evidence of Mr Schutte who was\ninvolved in the same incident and who identified Schone as the person\nwho had assaulted\nDr Serfontein with the sjambok. It is correct that\nthe assault of Dr Serfontein with a sjambok is undisputed but\ntwo perpetrators\nwere identified whilst we know that only one person\ncommitted the offence. Clearly, there is doubt as to the identity of\nthe sjambok\nassailant between Anton Paul le Roux and Schone and for\nthat reason both must be given the benefit of the doubt. Schone is\nthe person\nwho fooled around with the horse. That is the incident\nthat led to the mayhem on the day in question. His conduct on the\nhorse, whilst\nprobably morally reprehensible, does not make him\nguilty of public violence. He was not implicated in any other\ntransgression save\nfor the Serfontein sjambok incident, for which, as\nalready found, he profits from the benefit of the doubt. The appeal\nagainst his\nconviction must also be upheld.\n[31]\tAppellant no 4 (Willem le\nRoux) was convicted on evidence that he took biltong from the shop\nwhen the mayhem started, without\npaying for it. He was not identified\nby any witnesses as having taken part in or associated himself with\nthe criminal conduct that\nfollowed. Other mention of his\nparticipation in the criminal conduct of that day came from Keyser,\nwhich he disputed, but we have\nno corroboration of Keyserâs\ntestimony in this regard. His appeal against his conviction must also\nsucceed.\n[32]\tAppellant no 5 (Gerhardus\nRossouw) was identified first by Keyser and then by Shaun Jamieson as\none of the attackers that surrounded\nhis family. Shaun Jamieson\ntestified that this appellant was not involved in the assaults on him\nand Van Wyk but stated that he saw\nhim throw some punches at a patron\nas the group moved away. Furthermore, J C le Roux also mentioned in\nhis evidence that Gerhardus\nRossouw assaulted a patron at the door of\nthe restaurant. This corroborated Keyserâs evidence that he and\nthis appellant assaulted\na patron at that door. Carl Jeppe also\nidentified Gerhardus and Louis Rossouw assaulting patrons\nrespectively. It is clear from the\nevidence regarding the Jamieson\nincident that Louis Rossouw is the person who assaulted Shaun\nJamiesonâs brother-in-law which is\nalso apparent from J C le Rouxâs\nevidence.\n[33]\tIn view of the fact that\nGerhardus and Louis Rossouw elected not to testify during the trial,\nthe evidence against them was not\ncontradicted. The evidence against\nthese appellants shows direct association by both in the\ntransgressions committed there. In\nS\nv De Kock\n(244/2004)\n[2005] ZASCA 9\n(18 March 2005)\nthis court\nwas concerned with an accusedâs failure to give evidence and the\ninferences that may legitimately be drawn from such\nfailure and said:\nâ\n[17]\tThe\nessential question before this court is whether the state had\nestablished a prima facie case against the appellant that\nnecessitated\nan explanation. While an accused has the right to remain\nsilent, a right now also entrenched in the Constitution, where the\nevidence\nfor the state is such that it calls for an answer, and none\nis forthcoming, the stateâs case will be found proved beyond a\nreasonable\ndoubt. The classic statement of this principle is to be\nfound in\nS\nv Mthetwa\n1972 (3) SA 766\n(A) at 769D-F, per Holmes JA:\nâ\nWhere .\n. . there is direct\nprima\nfacie\nevidence implicating the accused in the commission of the offence,\nhis failure to give evidence,\nwhatever\nhis reason may be\nfor such failure, in general\nipso\nfacto\ntends to strengthen the Stateâs case, because there is then nothing\nto gainsay it, and therefore less reason for doubting its credibility\nor reliability; . . ..ââ\n9\nTo sum up therefore my view is that the guilt of\nGerhardus and Louis Rossouw was proved beyond reasonable doubt and\nthe appeals against\ntheir convictions must also fail.\n[34]\tThe argument advanced in support of the appeals\nagainst sentence is that the trial court committed a misdirection\nwhen it refused\na postponement application by the appellants. The\nbasis advanced for the application was to provide the appellants with\nan opportunity\nto source pre-sentence reports more particularly\ncorrectional supervision reports before the imposition of sentence.\nIt was argued\nthat the reason pre-sentence reports were necessary was\ndue to the fact that six years had elapsed since the commission of\nthe offence\nwith the consequence that the appellantsâ\npredispositions had changed in that period and that they had become\nmore mature individuals.\nThe criticism levelled at the trial court is\nthat it refused the postponement application simply because it had\nformed the view that\nonly direct imprisonment was appropriate in this\ncase. It was further submitted that the issue of sentence should be\nremitted back\nto the trial court for reconsideration in view of the\ndelay of five years from the time when the appellants were sentenced\nto when\ntheir appeals were heard by the court a quo. It was submitted\nin this regard that a period of some 13 years had elapsed since the\ncommission of the offence to the hearing of the appeal before us and\nthat a lot has happened in the lives of the appellants in the\nintervening period. This, it was submitted, called for the sentences\nto be considered afresh taking account of the appellantsâ\ncurrent\ncircumstances.\n[35]\tIt is correct that pre-sentence reports and other\nreports of that nature do in the normal course assist trial courts\nwith regards\nto sentence. In the main pre-sentence reports are used\nto bring the personal circumstances of accused persons to the fore.\nThe role\nof pre-sentence reports must, however, not be confused with\nthe obligation of a trial court to impose an appropriate sentence in\nthe first place. As stated in many cases which it is not necessary to\ncite, sentence is a matter for the discretion of the trial\ncourt and\na court of appeal must focus on whether that discretion was exercised\njudicially. As an appeal court we should be slow\nto interfere in\nsentences imposed by trial courts where the exercise of their\ndiscretion is beyond reproach. See\nS v Pieters\n1987 (3) SA 717\n(A) at 727F-H where the following is stated:\nâ\nMet betrekking tot appÃ¨lle\nteen vonnis in die algemeen is daar herhaaldelik in talle uitsprake\nvan hierdie Hof beklemtoon dat vonnis-oplegging\nberus by die\ndiskresie van die Verhoorregter. Juis omdat dit so is, kan en sal\nhierdie Hof nie ingryp en die vonnis van ân Verhoorregter\nverander\nnie, tensy dit blyk dat hy die diskresie wat aan hom toevertrou is\nnie op ân behoorlike of redelike wyse uitgeoefen het\nnie. Om dit\nandersom te stel: daar is ruimte vir hierdie Hof om ân\nVerhoorregter se vonnis te verander alleenlik as dit blyk dat\nhy sy\ndiskresie op ân onbehoorlike of onredelike wyse uitgeoefen het. Dit\nis die grondbeginsel wat alle appÃ¨lle teen vonnis beheers.â\nThe issue, in my view, is whether the sentence imposed\nby the trial court in this case is appropriate. In itself the refusal\nto allow\na postponement for purposes of a pre- sentence report is not\na misdirection. It is clear, in this case, that all the appellantsâ\npersonal circumstances were considered by the trial court before it\nimposed sentence. The trial court was also clearly conscious\nof the\nsix year time lapse from when the offence was committed up to the\nconclusion of the trial. We were not informed during argument\nwhat\nfacts were left out of account by the trial court before it imposed\nsentence. The facts in casu are clearly distinguishable\nto those in\nS\nv Van Rooyen\n2002 (1) SACR 608\n(C) where a\npre-sentence report was found to be essential more so as a juvenile\nwas involved.\n[36]\tThere is clearly no basis in this matter to find\nthat the trial court committed a misdirection when it refused the\npostponement\napplication. I am further of the view that the evidence\nwe have in this matter shows that an incident of magnified\nproportions occurred\nat Tant Malieâs restaurant on that fateful day\nin June 1996. The most recent exposition of the approach to the\nsentencing of people\nconvicted of public violence is found in the\nmatter of\nS v\nWhitehead & others\n(supra)\nwhere a sentence of five yearsâ imprisonment, two of which were\nsuspended, was upheld by this court. In that matter the\noffence was\ncommitted in August 1995 and the appeal in this court was heard in\nNovember 2008 ie a period of 13 years as we have in\nthis case. In\ndismissing the appeal against sentence this court expressed itself\nthus:\nâ\nThe\nsentences were not startlingly inappropriate, nor do they induce a\nsense of shock. The appellants and their cohorts brazenly,\nin broad\ndaylight, in the face of a substantial police presence, set upon a\ngroup of peaceful workers and severely assaulted them\nwith lethal\nweapons. They indiscriminately smashed cars of innocent bystanders\nand pursued and assaulted other black persons who\nhad nothing to do\nwith the striking workers. Amongst those assaulted were women and\nelderly persons. It was demeaning and humiliating\nto them in the\nextreme. A substantial jail sentence was, in my view, warranted,\nparticularly where as a consequence of their actions\na life was\nlost.â\n10\nIn this case, which is not dissimilar to\nWhitehead\n,\nfamilies were out on an afternoon to have fun and minding their own\nbusiness when they were wantonly and violently subjected to\nsenseless\nassaults. All the factors, especially this one, show that the conduct\nto which the appellants were parties on that day\nwas sufficiently\nserious as to warrant severe punishment. Based on all the above I\nhave no hesitation in finding that the trial courtâs\nsentence was\nfully justified.\n[37]\tWith regard to the submission concerning the delay\nin the appeal, generally an appeal court is not at liberty, when\ndealing with\nan appeal against sentence, to take into account facts\nthat were not before the trial court when it imposed sentence.\n11\nWhere however there are exceptional facts and circumstances that come\nto light after sentence but before an appeal is finalised an\nappeal\ncourt can have regard to these facts.\n12\nThis is done in most instances where the appeal court has found some\nmisdirection on the part of the sentencing court. In this regard\nthe\nappeal court could either remit the matter to the trial court for a\nfresh consideration of sentence taking account of the new\nfacts or it\ncould itself deal with the matter in the process of arriving at an\nappropriate sentence.\n13\n[38]\tIt is so that in the case before us a total of 13\nyears has elapsed since the commission of the offence. The appellants\nendured\nsix years during which they attended the trial until they\nwere convicted and sentenced. I have already stated that the refusal\nof\na postponement for purposes of sourcing pre-sentence reports did\nnot prejudice the appellants as all relevant facts were placed before\nthe trial court. Another period of seven years has now elapsed from\nthe time the appellants applied for leave to appeal from the\ntrial\ncourt to the court a quo and eventually to this court. The appeal\nfrom the trial court to the court a quo took five years to\nbe heard\nbut remarkably there is nothing in the record before us to account\nfor this delay. This was also not dealt with in argument\nbefore us. I\nmention this because we have no idea if there are any new facts,\nexceptional or otherwise, that could require consideration\nin\ndeciding whether the matter should be referred back for a fresh\nconsideration of sentence. It is not the appellantsâ case that\nthe\nsix year duration of the trial infringed their right to a fair trial.\nAs regards the period of the delay in finalising the appeal\nthat\nalso, in my view, cannot found a basis to refer the matter back\nunless we can conclude that the right to a fair trial was infringed.\n\nIn\nS v Pennington\n1992\n(2) SACR 329\n(CC) the issue of appeal delays was considered by the\nConstitutional Court in the context whether this infringed the fair\ntrial rights\nof the applicants in that matter. There the\nConstitutional Court expressed itself as follows:\nâ\n[39]\tBoth the interim\nConstitution and the 1996 Constitution deal with the rights of\naccused persons to a fair trial. Section 25(3)\n(a)\nof the interim\nConstitution includes within this right the right to a trial âwithin\na reasonable time after having been chargedâ,\nand s 35(3)\n(d)\nof the 1996\nConstitution to the right âto have their trial begin and conclude\nwithout unreasonable delayâ. Although delays in\nthe hearing of an\nappeal might extend the period of anxiety which the appellants\nundergo before finality is reached, appellate delays\nare materially\ndifferent to trial delays. To begin with there can be no question of\nprejudice, for the appeal is decided on the trial\nrecord, and the\noutcome of the appeal cannot be affected in any way by the delay.\nMoreover, where the appeal fails, as it did in\nthe present case, the\nappellant's guilt, established at the trial, has been confirmed.â\nAnd further\nâ[41]\tUndue\ndelay in the hearing of criminal appeals is obviously undesirable,\nparticularly when the appellants are in custody.\nIt does not follow,\nhowever, that such delay constitutes an infringement of the\nconstitutional right to a fair trial. That question\ncan be left open,\nfor even if it were to be regarded as an infringement of that or some\nother constitutional right, I am satisfied\nthat it would not entitle\nthe appellants to have their convictions set aside or their sentences\nreduced on appeal.â\n[39]\tOn the authority of\nS v\nPennington\nthe delay in finalising the appeal\nby itself did not infringe the appellantsâ fair trial rights. In\nthe absence of any exceptional\ncircumstances impacting on the\nsentences that were imposed we are not at large to set aside the\nsentences. There is also no basis\nto refer the matter back. I\nconclude therefore that there is no basis upon which we can set aside\nthe sentences imposed in this matter\nand to refer the matter back to\nthe trial court for the reconsideration of the sentence. The appeals\nagainst the sentences must also\nconsequently fail.\n[40]\tIn the circumstances the following order is\ngranted:\n1.\tThe appeals against conviction succeed in respect of\nappellants 2, 3, 4 and 7. Their convictions and sentences are set\naside.\n2.\tThe appeals of appellants 1, 5 and 6 are dismissed.\n_________________\nD MLAMBO\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS:  \t1\nst\n& 2\nnd\nâ B\nRoux;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\nrd\nâ\nM M W van Zyl\t;\n5\nth\nâ C Kriel\n7\nth\n&\n11\nth\nâ F Van der\nWesthuizen;\n13\nth\nâ H H Cowley\nINSTRUCTED BY:              \t(1\nst\n,\n2\nnd\n& 5\nth\nappellants) David H Botha, Du Plessis & Kruger Inc; Johannesburg\n(3\nrd\n& 13\nth\nappellants) Juan Kotze Attorneys; Boksburg\n(7\nth\n& 11\nth\n)\nPretoria Justice Centre; Pretoria\nCORRESPONDENT:          \t(1\nst\n,\n2\nnd\n, 3\nrd\n,\n5\nth\n, 13\nth\n)\nSymington & De Kok; Bloemfontein\n(7\nth\n& 11\nth\n)\nBloemfontein Justice Centre; Bloemfontein\nCOUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT:\tJ J KotzÃ©\nINSTRUCTED BY:\t\t\tThe Director of Public Prosecutions,\nPretoria\nCORRESPONDENT:\tThe Director of Public Prosecutions,\nBloemfontein\n1\nIn terms of\ns 174\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Act\n51 of 1977\nas amended.\n2\nC R Snyman\nCriminal Law\n5 ed\np 321.\n3\nJ R L\nMilton\nSouth\n\tAfrican Criminal Law and Procedure\nVol\n\tII p 74:\nâ\nPublic\n\tviolence consists in the unlawful and intentional commission, by a\n\tnumber of people acting in concert, of acts of sufficiently\nserious\n\tdimensions which are intended violently to disturb the public peace\n\tor security or to invade the rights of others.â\n4\nR v Salie\n1938\n\tTPD 136\nat 138-139;\nR v Cele\n1958\n\t(1) SA 144\n(N) at 152E-153C;\nS v\n\tMlotshwa\n1989 (4) SA 787\n(W) at 795.\n5\n2008 (1) SACR 431 (SCA).\n6\nAt p 703B.\n7\nAt 703I.\n8\nThis is the person whose appeal was upheld by the\n\tNorth Gauteng High Court.\n9\nSee also\nOsman v Attorney-General, Transvaal\n[1998] ZACC 14\n;\n1998 (2) SACR 493\n(CC) at para 22 where Madala J stated: âOur\n\tlegal system is an adversarial one.

    "facts": "On 17 June 1996 a large public disturbance occurred at Tant Malie's restaurant in Hartebeespoort, Gauteng. A group of men, identifiable by dark windbreakers, attacked patrons, assaulted individuals, damaged furniture, glassware and other property, and threatened staff. Seven of the accused – the Le Roux brothers, Nankervis, Rossouw brothers and Schone – were present and later charged, together with several others, with public violence and other offences. The trial court convicted all seven of public violence and sentenced each to six years' imprisonment, with part of the sentences suspended. Subsequent appeals to the High Court were dismissed, prompting further appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The court had to determine (1) whether the incident qualified as public violence under South African law; (2) whether each appellant had actively participated or associated himself with the violent acts; (3) whether the trial court erred in refusing a postponement to obtain pre‑sentence reports; and (4) whether the length of the appellate process infringed the appellants' fair‑trial rights.",
    "principles": "Public violence is defined as the unlawful, intentional commission of serious acts by a group acting in concert to disturb public peace or invade rights (Snyman; Milton). Conviction requires proof of each accused's participation or association with the common purpose (Mgedezi). State witness testimony, especially from accomplices like Keyser, must be corroborated. Sentencing discretion lies with the trial judge, and appellate interference is limited to misdirections (S v Pieters). Delay in appeals does not, by itself, constitute a breach of fair‑trial rights (S v Pennington).",
    "application": "The Court found that the restaurant disturbance met the seriousness and group‑conduct elements of public violence. Evidence showed that appellants 2, 3, 4 and 7 actively participated or encouraged the violence, satisfying the association requirement. For appellant 1 (J C le Roux) the court concluded that the evidence of leadership and threats confirmed participation, so his conviction stood. Appellant 5 (Gerhardus Rossouw) and 6 (Louis Rossouw) were linked by multiple witnesses to assaults, warranting conviction. Conversely, for appellant 2 (Timmy Nankervis) the evidence was insufficient to prove participation, leading to reversal of his conviction. The Court held that the trial judge’s refusal to grant a postponement was not a misdirection, as all relevant facts had been considered, and that the appellate delay did not prejudice the fairness of the sentences.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal set aside the convictions and sentences of appellants 2, 3, 4 and 7. The appeals of appellants 1, 5 and 6 were dismissed, leaving their convictions and sentences intact. The appeal against sentence was also dismissed, with the Court affirming that the trial judge had exercised proper discretion."
