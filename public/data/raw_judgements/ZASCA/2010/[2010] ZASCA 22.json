The conviction and sentence are set asideâ\nJUDGMENT\n___________________________\n__________________________________________\nTSHIQI\nJA (CLOETE JA and SALDULKER AJA concurring):\n[1]\tOn\n21 July 2003 the appellant was convicted in the regional court,\nPretoria, of having raped the complainant, Mary Sesane, his\ndomestic\nworker. The rape was alleged to have taken place in her room which\nwas inside his yard at a distance of 10 metres from the\nmain house,\nwhere he lived with his wife and children. On 30 September 2003 he\nwas sentenced to 10 yearsâ imprisonment. The appellant\nadmitted\nthat sexual intercourse had taken place but pleaded consent. On 26\nSeptember 2005, his appeal to the Pretoria High Court\nwas dismissed\nand he now appeals with leave of that court, against both conviction\nand sentence.\n[2]\tThe\nlayout of the appellantâs home is relevant in assessing the\ncredibility of both the appellant and the complainant for reasons\nthat will become apparent. The layout of the appellantâs home was\ndescribed by the appellant and his evidence in this regard was\nconfirmed by his wife. He testified that the main house was situated\nin the middle of the erf which measured 24 metres wide. A flat\nwhich\nwas occupied by his son was also situated on the erf approximately 10\nmetres away from the right side of the main house. The\ncomplainantâs\nroom was attached to the flat and the two rooms were separated by a\nkitchen measuring two by three metres. The complainantâs\nroom was\nsituated approximately two metres from the flat and approximately ten\nmetres from the nearest room in the main house. The\nnearest room of\nthe main house was occupied by one of the appellantâs children. The\nchildâs room nearest to the complainant was\ndirectly next to a\nbathroom and then there was the main bedroom. The complainantâs\nroom was approximately two metres from the neighbouring\nwall. On the\nneighbourâs property, the neighbourâs domestic workerâs room\nwas the closest to the complainantâs room. Her\nroom was\napproximately two metres from the wall, then another two metres from\nthe wall to the complainantâs room. The neighbourâs\nmain bedroom\nwindow was approximately nine metres from complainantâs room. The\nneighbourâs domestic worker was working on the\nnight of the\nincident. This evidence on the lay-out remained unchallenged except\nin relation to whether there was a garage or not.\nAccording to the\ncomplainant there was a garage. According to the appellant, whose\nversion was corroborated by his wife, by the time\nthat the alleged\nrape took place the garage had been converted into a flat in which\nhis eldest son was sleeping.\n[3]\tThe\ncomplainant was a single witness in regard to the rape. She testified\nthat during the early hours of 30 January 2000 at approximately\n01h40, while she was sleeping in her room the appellant knocked on\nthe door of her  room and called her name. She quickly put on\na\nT-shirt and skirt. She opened the door and the appellant came in\ncarrying a small fire-arm wrapped in a T-shirt and a 2 litre coke.\nHis upper body was naked and he wore short pants and slippers. The\nappellant then instructed her not to make a noise, but to obey\nhis\ninstructions. He placed the 2 litre Coke on top of the table together\nwith the firearm. He locked the door and told her that\nhe wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with her. She asked him why he wanted to\nsleep with her as he had a wife. The appellant told\nher that his wife\nwas drunk. She told him that she would not be in a position to do so\nbecause she did not come there to work for\nhim and to sleep with him\nas well. He then ordered her to lie on top of the bed, he put on a\ncondom, took off her panties and lifted\nup her skirt and started\nhaving sexual intercourse with her. While he was having sexual\nintercourse with her, he heard the garage\ndoor open and the appellant\nsaid he would go and check who was opening it. The appellant went\noutside and she locked the door.  After\na while he came back,\nknocked, shouted her name and asked her to open the door. She did not\ndo so and kept quiet.\n[4]\tThe\nfollowing morning at 07h30 he returned and asked her to open the door\nwhich she did. She noticed that his slippers were still\nthere. He\nasked her if she was alright and told her that she should not tell\nanybody what had happened earlier that morning. He came\nback for a\nsecond time and requested her politely to go to the kitchen  to clean\nthe dishes and sweep the floor. He returned for\na third time and\nborrowed R20 from her because he wanted to go to a doctor. She gave\nhim the R20 and he again told her never to tell\nanybody of what had\nhappened.\nShe did what he had requested her to do\nin the kitchen and after she had taken a bath, went to Atteridgeville\nto ask her younger\nsister to show her where the police station in\nPretoria West was. Her sister accompanied her to the police station\nwhere she laid\na charge of rape against the\nappellant. The police sent her\nfor a medical\nexamination.\n[5]\tA\ncompleted report by an authorised medical practitioner on the\ncompletion of a medical legal examination form (form\nJ88) was handed in by agreement and the doctor who had completed it\nwas not called to testify. On the J88 the doctor described the\ninjury\nto the complainantâs labia minora as an âabrasion 5 oâclock\npositionâ and concluded that her genital  injuries were\nâcompatible\nwith forcible penetration of vagina with large object like penisâ.\nThe schematic drawing of the findings section\nof the form reflects a\nsingle abrasion as described.  No further injuries were noted and no\nother substantial medical conclusions\ncan be gleaned from the J88.\nThe magistrate dealt with these injuries in the following manner:\nâ\nThe\nevidence of the complainant is furthermore supported in some respects\nby the medical evidence. The medical report showed swelling\non the\nprivate parts as well as abrasions. The doctorâs comment was that\nthe injuries were compatible with forceful penetration\nof the vagina\nwith a large object like a penis.â\nThis\nsummation of the doctorâs findings by the magistrate is inaccurate.\nThe medical report makes no mention of âswellingsâ\non the private\nparts and refers to âabrasionâ and not âabrasionsâ as stated\nby the magistrate. The magistrate also does not\nstate in what\nrespects the evidence of the complainant is supported by the medical\nevidence. It was common cause that sexual intercourse\nhad taken\nplace. The doctorâs conclusion is not that the injury she found was\nonly compatible with forceful penetration.\n[6]\tThe\nversion of the appellant was that he went to the complainantâs room\nlate in the evening of 29 September 2000 after his wife\nand youngest\nson had gone to bed. They started chatting, which was not unusual\nbetween them because on occasions when he worked night\nduty, he would\nbe at home during the day and they usually sat together watching\ntelevision whilst his wife was at work. Whilst they\nwere chatting\nthat evening he saw her breasts through her blouse which was not\nbuttoned up and asked her whether she did not want\nto have sexual\nintercourse. He stated that such a thought had previously occurred to\nhim whilst they were alone in the house. She\nresponded that she was\nafraid of his wife. He told her that she was asleep and offered to\ngive her money. She agreed on condition\nthat they used condoms\nbecause she was not on contraceptives. He stated that the complainant\nhad condoms in a margarine container\nbut he decided not to use them\nbecause some of them had already been used. He told her he had\ncondoms and would go and fetch them\nfrom the house. He asked if she\nwanted anything from the house and she said that she only wanted\ncooldrink. He came back with the\ncooldrink and a condom and they had\nsexual intercourse. At some stage he informed her that he was tired.\nThey changed positions and\nhe climbed on top and they continued. He\nagain told her he was too tired to continue and they ended the\nintercourse before he ejaculated.\nHe took a sip of the cooldrink,\ntook off the condom, put on his clothes and left, leaving his\nslippers and the condom behind.\n[7]\tThe\nfollowing morning he went back to her room and knocked. She opened\nthe door for him and he borrowed R20 from her to buy milk.\nHe told\nher that he would go to the garage to buy milk. She gave him his\nslippers. After he had coffee he again went to the room\nto tell her\nthat he was going to the bank to withdraw money. He asked her if she\nwas fine and whether she was cross with him and\nshe said she was not.\nWhen he came back at approximately 13h00, the complainant had left.\n[8]\tThe\nversion of what happened in her room the following day is for the\nmost part common cause. On either version, it is clear that\nwhen the\nappellant came to her room the following morning she opened for him\nwithout resistance. It is also not in dispute that she\ngave him a\nloan of R20 willingly. The complainant came back to his home the\nfollowing Tuesday in the company of three police officers.\nHe stated\nthat on this day he could not pay her salary because he did not have\nenough money but only paid her R70; comprised of R50\nfor the sexual\nintercourse and R20 for the loan. The payment of R50 and why it was\npaid became a bone of contention because the complainant\ndenied that\nshe accepted the R50 and also denied that there was an agreement to\npay it in exchange for the sexual intercourse. The\nappellantâs wife\ncorroborated his version that they paid the R50 to the complainant.\nAlthough his wife could not testify that this\nwas indeed paid in\nconsequence of an agreement between the appellant and the\ncomplainant; her testimony was that according to her\nthis money was\npaid for the sexual intercourse.\n[9]\tThe\nmagistrate rejected the appellantâs version that the R50 was for\nsexual intercourse, and stated that she was of the âopinionâ\nthat\nthe money was for âher duties not for sex.â It is not clear on\nwhat basis the magistrate formed this opinion as it was neither\nthe\ncomplainantâs nor the appellantâs version.\n[10]\tRelated\nto the divergence pertaining to the payment of R50 is a document\nproduced at the instance of appellant during the course\nof the trial.\nThis document was produced after the complainant had been excused\nafter leading her evidence. She was recalled and\nthe appellant\nthrough his legal representative produced the document that was\nwritten by his wife on his instructions and given to\nthe complainant\nto sign as an acknowledgement of moneys she had received. This\ndocument specifies that the complainant was given\nan amount of R670 â\nâJanuarie se salaris van R350 plus R250 vir Desember plus R50 wat\nhy haar ekstra gee plus R20 wat hy haar\ngeleen het.â Both the\nappellant and his wife were cross-examined at length on this document\nand the reason why this document does\nnot specify that the R50 was\nfor sexual intercourse. His explanation was that the document was\ngiven to the complainant to sign as\nproof that she had been paid her\nfull salary.  The failure to specify the reason for the payment of\nthe R50 seems to have influenced\nthe court below in rejecting the\nversion of the appellant with regards to the reason for its payment. \nThe court below found it strange\nthat the appellantâs wife did not\nspecify in the document signed by the complainant that the R50 was\nfor sex. The learned Judgeâs\nreasoning was that the appellant\nshould have found it prudent to specify that the R50 was for sex\nbecause at that stage he had already\nbeen arrested on rape\nallegations. This conclusion by the court below loses sight of the\nfact that the purpose for which the document\nhad been prepared was to\nprove that the complainant had been paid her salary and all her\noutstanding moneys. On either version, it\nis clear that the R20 was\nfor the loan and that the R50 was not part of the complainantâs\nsalary. If the version of the appellant\nthat the R50 was for sexual\nintercourse is rejected on the basis that it is not true, it is\ninexplicable why the appellant would\ndecide to give the complainant\nR50 extra for no reason; a few days after she had laid a charge of\nrape against him. In my view therefore\nnothing turns on this\nomission. For the same reasons, it is irrelevant that the appellantâs\nwife was the scribe of the document.\n[11]\tWhen\nevaluating the evidence of the appellant, the magistrate stated that\nit was riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies\nand that it\ncould not be reasonably possibly true. The magistrate found the\ncomplainant a satisfactory witness in all material respects.\nIn\nreaching that conclusion she relied on her performance in court;\nsupposedly her demeanour and the medical evidence. It is therefore\nnecessary to deal with these findings by the magistrate, and to the\nextent of their relevance, how the court below approached this\nevidence and the findings by the magistrate in dismissing the appeal.\n[12]\tAs\nstated above, the magistrateâs description of the injuries\nappearing in the J88 was inaccurate. Her conclusion that the\nmedical\nreport supports the version of the complainant was also wrong because\nthe medical conclusion does not isolate forcible penetration\nas the\nonly cause for the abrasion. It is therefore not surprising that she\ncame to a wrong conclusion and thereby misdirected herself\nin this\nregard. The version of the appellant on the other hand is consistent\nwith the findings in the J88 and gives a probable explanation\nfor the\nclinical findings in that the appellant described the sexual\nintercourse as ârofâ and further stated that after he told\nthe\ncomplainant that he was tired she climbed on top of him until he\ninformed her that he was tired. His version suggests that they\nhad\nwild intercourse for a lengthy period of time. Sheer logic dictates\nthat a single abrasion can not be unexpected under these\ncircumstances.\n[13]\tIt\nis inconceivable on what basis the magistrate found the evidence of\nthe complainant honest and reliable in the midst of the\nfollowing\nimprobabilities:\nThe\nlayout of the yard shows that the complainantâs room was a mere two\nmetres from the room in which the appellantâs son was\nsleeping, two\nmetres from the neighbourâs wall and ten metres from the nearest\nroom in the main house. The appellantâs wife and\nhis children were\nall at home that night. If the complainantâs version regarding the\ntime of the rape is accepted; then it means\nthat the appellantâs\nson was in a flat two metres from the complainantâs room sleeping.\nIt is improbable that the appellant went\nout of his bedroom carrying\na fire-arm, knocked on her door and raped the complainant in her room\nat that time of the night, because\nin so doing he would be taking a\nhuge risk that the complainant would not react nor act in such a\nmanner as to wake up his son who\nwas a mere two metres away from\nthem; or his other family members who were in the main house. It is\nfurther improbable that when\nthe appellant heard a noise from the\ngarage; appreciating a possibility that it could be his son; would go\nout of his domestic workerâs\nroom during the early hours of the\nmorning without fearing that his son would see him or find his\nbehaviour bizarre. That, according\nto her, he then came back and\nknocked and shouted her name, with no regard for the son on whose\naccount he had interrupted the sexual\nintercourse is more astounding.\nThe same applies to her evidence that he came back expecting her to\nopen her room for him again;\na few minutes after he had just raped\nher. What makes far more sense is the appellantâs version that he\nwent to her room and engaged\nin sexual intercourse with her by\nconsent clearly with no fear that the complainant would do something\nto wake up his family. There\nis also nothing improbable in his\nversion that he interrupted the sexual intercourse because he was\ntired.\n[14]\tThe\nother missing piece in the puzzle of her evidence is the reason why\nthe appellant was carrying a bottle of 2 litre coke when\nhe came into\nher room. There is no cogent reason for the possession of the 2 litre\nCoke on her version. However the evidence of the\nappellant that he\nbrought the 2 litre Coke because she asked for it explains this.\nAccording to the complainant, he was carrying\nboth a fire-arm and the\n2 litre coke. It could be inferred from her testimony that the\npurpose for carrying the fire-arm was to threaten\nor intimidate her.\nEven so, her evidence that the appellant was carrying a fire-arm\nfalls to be rejected because of the contradictions\non whether she was\nindeed threatened or not with the fire-arm. In response to a question\nby the defence during cross-examination\non why she did not scream,\nshe stated that she did not scream because she saw the fire-arm and\nhad been told not to scream. When\nasked to explain her testimony in\nthat regard she gave a meaningless response. She was then\nspecifically asked whether the appellant\nhad said he would shoot her\nif she screamed and she responded that indeed the appellant had\nmentioned that. She was then asked to\nstate what the appellant said\nexactly thereafter and the cross-examination proceeded as follows:\nâ\nWat\nhet hy gesÃª mevrou? â He told me: âMary you should not shout,\nyou should not make a noise or anything, get on top of the\nbed and I\nshould sleep with  him, if not so, here is the firearm.â As a\nresult of this worship I did as he commanded me to.\nDit\nis baie interessant, want u sÃª dit nie in u verklaring nie en u het\nook nie in u getuienis in hoof gesÃª nie, waarom nie? â\nThe reason\nwhy I did not mention it, maybe the last portion, I mentioned it\nabove my sta tement that I should not shout, I should\njust remain\nsilent.\nMevrou\nu antwoord nie my vraag nie. Waarom het u dit nie in u verklaring\ngesit nie en waarom het u nie vandag in die hof voordat\nek vir u vrae\ngevra het dit vir die aanklaer en die hof gesÃª nie.? Hoekom steek u\ndit weg? â The reason why I did not mention\nit is because I have\nmentioned it already in my statement.\nWatter\nâstatement?â â Your worship the statement that has been handed\nin as an exhibit, I only mentioned that he had a firearm.\nMevrou\nkom ons vergeet dit, dit is nie my punt nie. U sÃª,â\nThen\nthe court interjected and the following exchange took place:\nâ\nListen\nthey say, at no point in time in the statement, in your evidence in\nchief and up to so far you never made mention of the fact\nthat\naccused person threatened you with the firearm and promise to kill\nyou, now why is that? â Your worship I did not explain,\nbecause in\nmy statement I explained that he had a firearm.â\nOn\nbeing questioned further on this aspect by the defence the following\nexchange took place:\nâ\nMevrou\nbaie mense dra net vuurwapens by hulle, niemand raak ook net sommer\nbang omdat iemand ân vuurwapen dra nie, ân mens raak\neers bang as\niemand jou dreig. â I was shocked and I was afraid because he was\nin possession of this firearm and he was in my bedroom.â\nâ\nMaar\nhy het u nie gedreig nie, is dit korrek? â He did not threaten me\nhe only said: âDo not make anything, here is the firearm.â\nU\nhet dit nie so gesÃª nie u het net gesÃª in u verklaring hy het ân\nvuurwapen gehad, u probeer nou die indruk skep by hierdie\nhof dat hy\nu gedreig het met die vuurwapen. â That is what I said, that he had\na firearm in his possession when he came to my bedroom.\nEn\ndit beteken eintlik maar niks nie. â I know that the duty of a\nfirearm is to kill a person, and I was shocked and afraid when\nI saw\nthis firearm.â\nIt\ncan be inferred from her contradictions on whether she was indeed\nthreatened with the fire-arm that the complainant fabricated\nher\nevidence in an attempt to bolster her version that she was coerced to\nengage in sexual intercourse. The court a quo misdirected\nitself by\nfinding that the complainant âdid not in any way contradict\nherselfâ in regard to her version as to the fire-arm. The\nappellant\non the other hand was truthful in that he did not deny that he owns a\nfire-arm. He in fact testified that he owned several\nfire-arms and\nthat he kept his fire-arms in a safe in his bedroom. He stated that\nthe safe was very close to his bed in which he\nslept with his wife\nand that the door of the safe made a loud noise when it is being\nopened. He testified that if he had tried to\nremove the fire-arm from\nthe safe that evening, his wife, who was already asleep in their bed\nwould have heard the noise. His wife\nconfirmed that she would have\nheard him if he tried to open the door of the safe that evening\nbecause it makes a loud noise and she\nis a light sleeper. The court a\nquo\nsaid\nit was ânot convincedâ by the denial of the appellant that he had\na fire-arm as he could have taken the fire-arm out of the\nsafe\nearlier without his wife knowing. The correct approach would have\nbeen to consider whether the appellantâs version that he\nhad no\nfire-arm could reasonably possibly have been true, particularly in\nthe light of the complainantâs contradictory evidence\nwhich I have\nquoted at some length because of its importance.\n[15]\tThe\nbehaviour of the complainant the following day is inconsistent with\nher version that she was raped. The complainant woke\nup the following\nday and continued with her normal duties as if nothing had happened\nuntil she completed what was necessary. Nothing\nprevented her from\nleaving at the earliest available opportunity that morning to go and\nreport her rape as she claims she intended\nto. There is absolutely no\nreason why she would lend an amount of R20 to a man who had just\nraped her carrying a fire-arm, a few\nhours before. The version of the\nappellant on the other hand explains his behaviour the following day.\nAs stated above his behaviour\nshows that he had no fear that he would\nbe caught. It is also not surprising that he would go to her room,\nearly in the morning to\nask if she was alright. This behaviour would\nindeed be nonsensical if he did so after having raped her a few hours\npreviously. It\nis also not unusual that he would ask her for a loan\nof R20 under the circumstances testified to by him, but not remotely\nprobable\nthat she would lend him money after he had raped her earlier\nthat morning.\n[16]\tThe\nappellant proferred an explanation as a probable reason why the\ncomplainant laid a charge of rape against him. The appellant\nstated\nthat he thought that the complainant incriminated him falsely because\nof a conflict between him, his wife and the complainant,\ninvolving\nhis child, a few days before. When the complainant was asked whether\nhe had encountered any problems with the appellant,\nshe stated that\nthere were no problems. During cross-examination, she was confronted\nabout an incident that has had occurred a few\ndays earlier when she\nwas confronted by the appellant and his wife because their youngest\nchild was found outside the yard, and she\nwas threatened with\ndismissal. She admitted the incident thereby contradicting her\nearlier evidence to the contrary. It is worth\ncommenting on the\napproach adopted by the court below in dealing with this incident.\nThe court below stated that it was suggested\nthat this incident was a\npossible motive by the complainant to incriminate the appellant\nfalsely. The court found that such a motive\nwas too remote and that\nthis was so because the dispute was resolved amicably. The court\ntherefore concluded that the complainant\nhad no motive. It is\ndoubtful that the court was correct in simply ruling out this\nincident as a possible motive. The complainant\nadmitted that the\nincident occurred. She was not only confronted by both the appellant\nand his wife but was also threatened with\ndismissal. It is trite that\nan accused may tender an explanation why he believes he has been\nfalsely implicated and it may turn out\nanother reason unknown to him\nexists or is more probable. The accused is called upon to speculate,\nnot testify on a matter of fact.\nIn such circumstances he cannot be\nblamed if it turns out that his explanation is found to be wanting.\n1\nIt would therefore be wrong to criticise the appellant if it turned\nout that this was not the reason. What is important is that the\nappellant was truthful when he relayed the incident to the court and\nthe incident cannot be ruled out as a possible reason why the\ncomplainant laid false charges against him.\n[17]\tIn\nan attempt to bolster her evidence, the complainant testified that\nthere was a garage outside and that it was as a result\nof noise\nemanating from the garage that sexual intercourse had been\ninterrupted. This evidence was a clear fabrication. The appellantâs\nevidence of his yard was not disputed and was further corroborated\nhis wife, who also\ndenied that there was a\ngarage at the time. The appellantâs son also corroborated this\nevidence in as far as he confirmed that he\nslept in a room outside\nthe main house\n(which could\nonly have been a flat). The court\na\nquo\nfound that the presence\nof the garage was immaterial because the real issue was whether or\nnot there was noise in that direction.\nIn my view the existence or\nnot of the garage is material because it deals with the reason\nadvanced by the complainant on why the\nsexual intercourse was\ninterrupted. She repeatedly said that the appellant had referred to\nâthe garage door.â He could not have\ndone so. There was no\ngarage. This in turn affects the credibility of the complainant. It\nfollows that if there was no garage, then\nit can be inferred that\nthere was no noise coming from a garage and that this version was\nfabricated by the complainant.\n[18]\tThe\nother clear fabrication found in the complainantâs evidence relates\nto the alleged alcohol consumption by the appellantâs\nwife. The\nappellant denied that he said this to the complainant. His wife\nstated that she is and had always been a teetotaler. This\nwas not\nchallenged during her cross-examination. No reason comes to mind on\nwhy the appellant who admitted that he had sexual intercourse\nwith\nthe complainant on his request and who further admitted that he\nallayed her fears pertaining to his wife by telling her that\nhis wife\nwas asleep, would deny that he had instead said that she was drunk. A\ndenial of this is of no moment.\n[19]\tThe\nmagistrate concluded that the appellantâs evidence was full of\ncontradictions. Apart from the fact that such contradictions\nare\nblatantly absent from her judgment, this conclusion is unfounded and\namounted to a clear misdirection. In support of this wrong\nconclusion, the magistrate further stated that the appellant stated\nthat âthe complainant consented to the sexual intercourse,\nbut\ncould not explain why she was injured. Then later he said it was\nbecause she was roughâ.\nThis\nprobable explanation by the appellant for the injuries of the\ncomplainant was not an afterthought nor a contradiction by the\nappellant. On the contrary it was consistent with his earlier version\nduring his evidence that the sexual intercourse was wild.\nThe\nappellant was a truthful witness who admitted that sexual intercourse\nhad taken place to which there were no witnesses in spite\nof the\npossible problems this would probably cause between him and his wife.\n[20]\tThe\nmagistrateâs criticism of the evidence of the appellantâs wife is\nalso unfounded and was based on wrong assumptions.\nThe appellantâs\nwife did not testify that she would do anything to keep her husband\nout of jail. She said that she would do anything\nto protect him, but\nimmediately added that she believed that what he said was the truth.\nIt was also incorrect for the magistrate\nto find that she could not\ntestify about what had occurred at night because she had gone to\nsleep. Her evidence in this regard was\nthat she would have heard her\nhusband if he woke up as she was a light sleeper and because they\nslept together like spoons. She also\nstated that she would have heard\nhim if he opened the gun safe because it made a lot of noise when it\nwas being opened. In\nS v\nGentle\n2\nCloete JA stated:\nâ\nThe\nrepresentative of the State submitted on appeal that (I quote from\nthe heads of argument):\nâ\n(T)here\nwas sufficient corroboration or âindicatorsâ to support the\noccurrence of the rapes.â\nIt\nmust be emphasised immediately that by corroboration is meant other\nevidence which supports the evidence of the complainant, and\nwhich\nrenders the evidence of the accused less probable,\non the issues in dispute\n(cf\nR\nv W\n1949\n(3) SA 772\n(A) at 778-9). If the evidence of the complainant differs\nin significant detail from the evidence of other State witnesses, the\nCourt\nmust critically examine the differences with a view to\nestablishing whether the complainantâs evidence is reliable. But\nthe fact\nthat the complainantâs evidence accords with the evidence\nof other State witnesses on issues not in dispute does not provide\ncorroboration.\nThus, in the present matter, for example, evidence\nthat the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant does\nnot provide\ncorroboration of her version that she was raped, as the\nfact of sexual intercourse is common cause. What is required is\ncredible\nevidence which renders the complainantâs version more\nlikely that the sexual intercourse took place without consent, and\nthe appellantâs\nversion less likely that it did not.â\nThe\nappellantâs wife was truthful and her corroboration of the\nappellantâs testimony should have been taken into account in\nevaluating\nthe evidence.\n[2\n1]\tThe\ncourt below also criticised the appellantâs evidence. He was\ncriticised for a failure to give an explanation as to why he\nleft his\nslippers in the room. The court belowâs reasoning is premised on a\nconclusion that he would not have wanted to leave any\ntracks in the\ncomplainantâs room. This finding does not take into account the\nconverse inference that the appellant may have left\nhis slippers\nthere because he did not fear that the complainant would use them\nagainst him because there was consent. Of course if\nthe appellant had\nindeed raped the complainant, he would have ensured, as stated by the\ncourt below, that he left no track in the\ncomplainantâs room.\n[22]\tIn\ncriticising the evidence of the appellant, the court a quo made a\nfurther factual error in stating that the appellant testified\nthat he\nwatched pornographic movies with the complainant. His evidence was\nthat the movies were ârofâ. When he was cross-examined\nfurther,\nhe stated that they watched M-Net stories but did not discuss sex;\nalthough the thought had occurred in his mind. It is\nthis factual\nerror that led the court a quo to conclude that it is very uncommon\nthat a female domestic worker will watch such movies\nwith her\nâmasterâ male employer, unless there are some sort of emotional\nfeelings. Apart from the fact that this Court has in\nthe past\ncriticised such bald generalisations,\n3\nthis conclusion was based on an incorrect factual summation of his\nevidence.\n[23]\tThe\ntest applicable in criminal proceedings is that the State ought to\nprove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe trial\ncourt must accept the version of an accused unless it is found that\nthis is not reasonably possibly true. In light of the\nimprobabilities\nand contradictions in the complainantâs version, the magistrate and\nthe court a quo misdirected themselves in accepting\nher version and\nrejecting the version of the appellant. There is no basis for\nrejecting the version of the appellant.\n[24]\tI\ntherefore make the following order:\n1.\tThe\nappeal is upheld.\n2.\tThe\norder of the court a quo is set aside and substituted with the\nfollowing:\nâThe\nappeal is upheld. The conviction and sentence are set aside.â\n____________________\nZ\nL L TSHIQI\nJUDGE\nOF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\n:\nAPPELLANT\n:\tL\nAugustyn\nInstructed\nby\tPretoria Justice Centre, Pretoria;\nBloemfontein\nJustice Centre, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT\n:\tR\nT Mareume\nInstructed\nby\tDirector of Public Prosecutions, Pretoria;\nDirector\nof Public Prosecutions, Bloemfontein\n1\nR v Mthembu\n1956 (4) SA 334\n(T) at 335H-336B;\nS v Kubeka\n1982 (1) SA 534\n(W) at 536D-537D and cases there cited;\nS v\n\tRamochela\n1997 (2) SACR 494\n(O) at 496a-e.\n2\n2005 (1) SACR 420\nat 421 para [18].\n3\nS v Scott Crossley\n2008 (1) SACR 223\n(SCA).",

    "facts": "The appellant, G Van der Watt, was convicted of raping his domestic worker, Mary Sesane, in her bedroom located in a separate flat on his property. The complainant testified that the appellant entered her room at 01:40 on 30 January 2000, brandishing a firearm and a two‑litre Coke, and forced sexual intercourse. She later reported the incident, and a medical report recorded a single labial abrasion described as compatible with forcible penetration. The appellant admitted intercourse but claimed consent, stating the encounter was voluntary, that he had brought the Coke at her request, and that he left her a loan of R20 and later paid R50 as part of his salary. Discrepancies arose regarding the existence of a garage, the presence of a firearm, and the timing of events in relation to other occupants on the property.",
    "issues": "The primary issue was whether the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant raped the complainant, i.e., that the intercourse was non‑consensual. Secondary issues concerned the credibility of the complainant’s testimony in view of inconsistencies about the layout of the property, the alleged firearm threat, the garage noise, and the payment of R50, as well as whether the medical evidence corroborated a rape.",
    "principles": "South African criminal procedure requires the State to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and to provide corroboration that makes the complainant’s version more probable than the accused’s. The court cited S v Gentle on the need for indicators beyond common cause (sexual intercourse) and held that contradictions or improbabilities in the complainant’s testimony undermine reliability. Medical findings must be interpreted cautiously; a single abrasion does not exclusively indicate forcible penetration.",
    "application": "The appellate court examined the property layout, finding it unlikely that the appellant could have entered the complainant’s room with a firearm without alerting nearby occupants. The complainant’s account of the garage noise was rejected because no garage existed. Inconsistencies regarding the firearm threat and the R50 payment were highlighted. The medical report was deemed inconclusive, supporting only that intercourse occurred, not that it was forced. The magistrate’s findings were deemed misdirected and unsupported, and the appellant’s version was found reasonably possibly true.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The conviction and ten‑year sentence were set aside, and the order of the court a quo was replaced with a declaration that the appeal is upheld and the conviction and sentence are set aside."
