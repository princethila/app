On the same day he was sentenced to 15 yearsâ\nimprisonment on the rape count and to 5 yearsâ imprisonment\nfor the\nrobbery. The magistrate did not order the two sentences to run\nconcurrently. Thus, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor\n20 years.\n[2]\tThe\nappellant appealed his convictions and sentence to the Pretoria High\nCourt. The appeal against both convictions was dismissed.\nHis appeal\nagainst sentence was, however, successful in part. The Pretoria High\nCourt took the view that the cumulative effect of\nthe sentence was\nsuch that it induced a sense of shock. The sentence of 20 yearsâ\nimprisonment referred to in the preceding paragraph\nwas replaced with\none of 16 yearsâ imprisonment â four years of the sentence on the\ncount of robbery were ordered to run concurrently\nwith the sentence\nof 15 yearsâ imprisonment imposed on the count of rape.\n[3]\tThe\nappellant applied to the Pretoria High Court for leave to appeal his\nconvictions and the related sentences to this court.\nIt appears that\nowing to an oversight on the part of the Pretoria High Court it\ninitially granted leave to appeal against convictions\nonly.\n[4]\tIn\ndebate before us on the merits of the convictions the question arose\nwhether the 15 year sentence imposed by the magistrate\nin respect of\nthe rape count was in accordance with the prescripts of s 51 of the\nCriminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 (the Act).\nThis aspect will be\ndealt with in detail in due course.\n[5]\tSubsequent\nto the issue being raised in argument the matter was postponed to\nenable the appellant to approach the Pretoria High\nCourt afresh for\nleave to appeal in respect of sentence. Such leave has since been\ngranted. Thus, we are dealing with an appeal against\nconvictions and\nsentence. During the hearing before us, prior to the postponement,\nsubmissions were made concerning sentence. In\naddition, we have\nsubsequently received written heads of argument on behalf of the\nappellant in respect of sentence.\n[6]\tIt\nis necessary to deal first with the convictions. It is true that in\nrespect of the rape count the appellant was convicted principally\non\nthe evidence of a single witness, namely, the complainant. However,\nthe magistrate had regard to the nature and quality of her\nevidence\nand that her version of events immediately after the alleged rape was\ncorroborated in material respects by an independent\nwitness. The\nmagistrate carefully took into account the quality of the appellantâs\nevidence. He found material aspects of the appellantâs\nevidence\nimprobable. An example is that the appellant testified that he had\nbeen falsely implicated because the complainant had become\njealous as\na result of an assumption she had made. The assumption was that he\nwas talking on his cellular telephone with another\nwoman whom he\nintended to see later that day. That testimony has to be contrasted\nwith his other evidence that earlier they had communicated\nconcerning\ntheir other relationships without any rancour.\n[7]\tThe\nmagistrate took into account that immediately after the complainant\nhad emerged from the veld where the rape had allegedly\noccurred she\nwas seen in a state of shock and anxiety. She was also tearful. The\nperson who saw her in this state testified and it\nis clear from his\nevidence that he was concerned about her well-being. The magistrate\nconsidered that when she was seen she was not\nin possession of any of\nher belongings. According to the complainant she was forced because\nof the rape to leave her possessions\nbehind. The magistrate rejected\nthe appellantâs version of events.\n[8]\tIn\nour view, the magistrate approached the evidence cautiously and\ncorrectly and his reasoning in respect of the conviction on\nthe rape\ncount cannot be faulted.\n[9]\tThe\ncount of robbery involved a different complainant. It was not\ncontested that she had been in the appellantâs car at material\ntimes. According to her, the appellant had dispossessed her with\nforce of her cellular telephone, cash and a pendant. She ultimately\nregained possession of these items after wrestling with him. The\ncomplainant on this count was also a single witness. The magistrate,\nonce again, carefully considered the nature and quality of her\nevidence. He found her a satisfactory witness and took into account\nthat she had not exaggerated in communicating her version of events.\nThe magistrate considered the appellantâs own evidence that\nthere\nhad been a heated disagreement between them but rejected his version\nthat she had grabbed the steering wheel whilst the vehicle\nin which\nthey were travelling was in motion. The magistrate rightly found his\nversion for the disagreement improbable.\n[10]\tIt\nis not necessary to say anything further concerning the magistrateâs\nreasons for convicting the appellant on the count of\nrobbery. Suffice\nto say that in this respect too his reasoning and conclusion are\ncorrect. I turn to deal with the sentence imposed\nin respect of the\ncount of rape.\n[11]\tAt\nthe time that the rape was perpetrated the appellant was a police\nreservist who had persuaded the complainant to accompany\nhim to a\nfunction. However, he drove her into the veld and perpetrated the\nrape in his car. It does not appear that the complainant\nsuffered any\nother serious physical injuries. At the time of sentencing, the\nappellant was 26 years old and unmarried with no children.\n[12]\tIn\nsentencing the appellant on this charge the Magistrate rightly stated\nthat women in this country had to be protected against\nthe scourge of\nrape. He referred, in general terms to the objects of the Act,\nnamely, to provide minimum sentences for serious offences.\n[13]\tThe\nmagistrate had regard to the minimum sentences prescribed for rape.\nThe following comments by him are of importance:\nâ\nVerkragting\nis een van die misdrywe wat gelys is in die betrokke bylae tot die\nwet, en maak dit voorsiening vir ân minimum vonnis\nvan 10 jaar\ngevangenisstraf met betrekking tot die eerste aanklag, tensy die hof\nkan bevind dat daar wesenlike en dwingende omstandighede\nbestaan, wat\ndie hof noop om ân mindere vonnis op te lÃª.â\n[14]\tSection\n51 of the Act prescribes minimum sentences for rape in distinct\ncategories. Section 51 (2)\n(b)\nprovides:\nâ\n(2)\nNotwithstanding any other law but subject to subsections (3) and (6),\na regional court or a High Court shall sentence a person\nwho has been\nconvicted of an offence referred to in â\n.\n. .\nPart\n\tIII of Schedule 2, in the case of â\n(i)\na first offender, to imprisonment for a period not less than 10\nyears;\n(ii)\na second offender of any such offence, to imprisonment for a period\nnot less than 15 years;\n.\n. .â\n1\n[15]\tA\nproviso to s 51 (2) of the Act reads as follows:\nâ\nProvided\nthat the maximum term of imprisonment that a regional court may\nimpose in terms of this subsection shall not exceed the minimum\nterm\nof imprisonment that it must impose in terms of this subsection by\nmore than five years.â\n[16]\tThe\nappellant is a first offender. From the comments of the magistrate\nreferred to in para 12 above, it appears that he was minded\nto impose\nthe\nminimum\nsentence\nof ten yearsâ imprisonment prescribed by s 51 (2)\n(b)\n(i)\nof the Act, but then proceeded to impose a sentence of 15 yearsâ\nimprisonment, which if regard is had to the proviso referred\nto in\nthe\npreceding paragraph is the\nmaximum\nsentence he could impose. The magistrate has, since leave to appeal\nagainst sentence was granted by the Pretoria High Court, provided\nfurther reasons for the sentence of 15 yearsâ imprisonment imposed\nby him.\n[17]\tIt\nis necessary to quote parts of the further reasons provided by him:\nâ\n[D]it\n[was] onder my aandag gebring dat ek tydens vonnisoplegging na die\nWet op minimum vonnisse 105 van 1997 verwys het. Ek het aangedui\ndat\ndie voorgeskrewe minimum vonnis vir die eerste aanklag tien jaar\ngevangenisstraf is, maar voortgegaan en ân vonnis van vyftien\njaar\ngevangenisstraf opgelÃª.â\nLater,\nthe following is stated:\nâ\nNa\ndie lees . . . van die getikte oorkonde is dit asof daar ân\ngedeelte van die vonnis uitspraak weg is. Daarmee sÃª ek nie dat\nân\ngedeelte van die uitspraak nie getik was nie. Skynbaar is ân\ngedeelte van my gedagtegang eerder nooit uitgespreek nie.\nEk\nsÃª dit omdat dit wat getik is, met verwysing na die minimum vonnis\nnie ooreenstem met die opgelegde vonnis nie. Ek was wel deeglik\nbewus\nvan wat die minimum vonnis was; nie net het ek dit in my uitspraak\ngenoem nie; ân groot gedeelte van die sake op my hofrol\nhou verband\nmet verkragting aanklagte en ek kan nie vir ân oomblik dink dat ek\nper abuis 15 jaar gevangenisstraf opgelÃª het nie.â\n[18]\tThe\nmagistrate states (almost eight years after the event) the following:\nâ\nEk\nwil graag noem dat ek die saak goed onthou en selfs kan onthou hoe\ndie tweede klaagster gelyk het. Laasgenoemde meld ek net ter\nstawing\ndaarvan dat ek die saak en die feite herroep.â\nThe\nmagistrate continues and states:\nâ\nIndien\ndie gedeelte waarna ek verwys, gelees word, sal opgemerk word dat ek\nmeld dat daar geen versagtende maar slegs verswarende\nomstandighede\naanwesig was, en, daarna verwys ek na die wet op minimum vonnisse. Ek\nwas bewus daarvan dat dieselfde wet bepaal dat\ndie hof gemagtig is om\nân hoÃ«r vonnis as die voorgeskrewe minimum op te lÃª, tot ân\nmaksimum van vyf jaar gevangenisstraf meer\nas die voorgeskrewe\nminimum vonnis.\nIn\ndie lig van wat ek reeds gesÃª het m.b.t verswarende omstandighede;\nis dit waarheen ek op pad was nl. Om van die ekstra vyf jaar\nstrafjurisdiksie gebruik te maak. Dit was my gedagtegang. Dit was\ndeurentyd my doel om die beskuldigde tot vyftien jaar gevangenisstraf\nop die eerste aanklag te vonnis.\nTydens\nvonnis oplegging het ek gedink dat ek reeds na die tersaaklike\nwetgewing verwys het, en het ek die beskuldigde derhalwe tot\nvyftien\njaar gevangenisstraf gevonnis.â\n[19]\tIt\nis not only a salutary practice but obligatory for judicial officers\nto provide reasons to substantiate conclusions. The magistrate\ndid\nnot do so in respect of the maximum sentence imposed by him. In an\narticle in\nThe South African Law Journal\n2\nentitled âWriting a Judgmentâ former Chief Justice M M Corbett\npointed out that this general rule applies to both civil and criminal\ncases. In civil cases it is not a statutory rule but one of practice.\nIn\nBotes & another v Nedbank Ltd\n1983\n(3) SA 27\n(A) at 27H-28A, this court held that in an opposed matter\nwhere the issues have been argued litigants are entitled to be\ninformed\nof the reasons for the judgeâs decision. See also in\nregard to the obligation to provide reasons\nRoad\nAccident Fund v Marunga\n2003 (5) SA 164\n(SCA)\nat 171E-172C.\n[20]\tWhen\na matter is taken on appeal a court of appeal has a similar interest\nin knowing why a judicial officer who heard the matter\nmade the order\nwhich he did. Broader considerations come into play. It is in the\ninterests of the open and proper administration\nof justice that\ncourts state publicly the reasons for their decisions. A statement of\nreasons gives some assurance that the court\ngave due consideration to\nthe matter and did not act arbitrarily. This is important in the\nmaintenance of public confidence in the\nadministration of justice.\n3\n[21]\tBefore\nthe matter was dealt with statutorily the same general rule of\npractice applied in criminal matters both in regard to\nconviction and\nsentence. In this regard see\nR v Majerero &\nothers\n1948 (3) SA 1032\n(A) where, at 1033\nthe following appears:\nâ\nWe\nare aware that there is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code\nfor the delivery of a judgment . . . but in practice such a\njudgment\nis invariably given and we wish now to say that it is clearly in the\ninterest of justice that it should be given.â\nSee\nalso\nR v Van der Walt\n1952 (4) SA 382\n(A) at 382H-383A and\nR v\nHuebsch\n1953 (2) SA 561\n(A) at 564G-565E.\n[22]\tIn\nS v Immelman\n1978 (3)\nSA 726\n(A) at 729B-D the following was said in respect of sentence:\nâ\nIt\nseems to me that, with regard to the sentence of the Court in cases\nwhere the trial Judge enjoys a discretion, a statement of the\nreasons\nwhich move him to impose the sentence which he does also serves the\ninterests of justice. The absence of such reasons may\noperate\nunfairly, as against both the accused person and the State. One of\nthe various problems which may be occasioned in the Court\nof Appeal\nby the absence of reasons is that in a case where there has been a\nplea of guilty but evidence has been led, there may\nbe no indication\nas to how the Court resolved issues of fact thrown up by the evidence\nor on what factual basis the Court approached\nthe question of\nsentence.â\n[23]\tIt\nbears mentioning that in the article referred to in paras 18 and 19\nabove the learned Chief Justice states that the practice\nof providing\nan order with reasons to be supplied later is one that should be used\nsparingly.\n4\n[24]\tSection\n146 of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1997 now provides that a\njudge presiding in a âsuperior courtâ shall, when\nhe decides any\nquestion of law or fact, give reasons for the conclusions reached by\nhim.\n[25]\tIn\nterms of s 93\nter\n(3)\n(c)\n,\n(d)\nand\n(e)\nof the\nMagistratesâ Courts Act 32 of 1944\nit is incumbent on a\nMagistratesâ Court to give reasons for its decisions of fact or\nlaw.\n[26]\tImportantly,\non the record in the present case there is no indication at all that\nthe imposition of the maximum sentence provided\nfor in\ns 51\n(3) was\nwithin the magistrateâs contemplation.\n[27]\tIn\nany event, there is a further fatal problem in respect of the\nsentence of 15 yearsâ imprisonment imposed by the magistrate.\nIn\nrespect of minimum sentence provisions our courts have insisted that\nparticularly unrepresented accused be informed of their implications.\nAlthough the appellant was represented, it is clear from the record\nthat there is no indication at all that the magistrate considered\nimposing the maximum sentence. The appellantâs legal representative\ncould consequently not have been invited to make submissions\nin this\nregard.\n5\n[28]\tThe\nsafeguards in relation to minimum sentences must\na\nfortiori\napply to the contemplated imposition\nof a maximum sentence. In relation to motivating the imposition of a\nmaximum sentence it is necessary\nto have regard to what was stated in\nS v Mbatha\n2009 (2)\nSACR 623\n(KZP) (at 631\nf\n-\nj\n):\nâ\nOn\nthat approach there is as much a necessity for the court in its\njudgment on sentence to identify on the record the aggravating\ncircumstances that take the case out of the ordinary, as there is for\nit in the converse situation to identify those substantial\nand\ncompelling circumstances that warrant the imposition of a lesser\nsentence than the prescribed minimum. The trial judge should\nidentify\nthe circumstances that impel her or him to impose a sentence greater\nthan the prescribed minimum and explain why they render\nthe\nparticular case one where a departure from the prescribed sentence is\njustified. The factors that render the accused more morally\nblameworthy must be clearly articulated. . . . Otherwise the whole\npurpose of a reasonably consistent and standardised approach to\nsentence in the case of the most serious crimes will be defeated, as\nit will open to those judges who have particularly stern views\non\nsentence, and regard Parliamentâs response to serious crime as\ninadequate, to impose those views in disregard of the purpose\nof the\nlegislation.â\nIn\nthe result in that case the sentence was set aside on the basis of\nthat irregularity.\n[29]\tIn\nthe present matter the requirements set out in the immediately\npreceding paragraphs were not met. The magistrateâs present\nspeculative articulation is unhelpful.\n6\nThe consequence is that the maximum sentence imposed is liable to be\nset aside. We have been informed by counsel that the appellant\nhas\nalready been released on parole. It was submitted on his behalf that\nthe setting aside of the sentence will have a practical\neffect on\nwhether parole conditions will continue to apply. That is a question\nthat is not necessary for us to consider.\n[30]\t\nIn light of the conclusions reached, the following order is made:\n1.\tThe\nappeal against convictions is dismissed.\n2.\tThe\nappeal against sentence is successful to the extent reflected\nhereafter.\n3\tThe\norder of the court below in respect of sentence is set aside and\nsubstituted as follows:\nâ\nThe\nmagistrateâs order in relation to sentence is set aside and\nsubstituted as follows:\nâ\n(a)\tIn\nrespect of count 1 the appellant is sentenced to ten yearsâ\nimprisonment.\n(b)\tIn\nrespect of count 4 the appellant is sentenced to five yearsâ\nimprisonment.\n(c)\tFour\nyears of the sentence set out in (b) is to run concurrently with the\nsentence referred to in (a).â â\n(d)\tThe sentence is\nantedated to 4 June 2002.\n_________________\nM\nS NAVSA\nJUDGE\nOF APPEAL\n_________________\nZ\nL L TSHIQI\nJUDGE\nOF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT\n:\tA\nVAN WYK\nInstructed\nby Legal Aid Board, Pretoria;\nLegal\nAid Board, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT\n:\tA\nCOETZEE\nInstructed\nby\tDirector of Public Prosecutions, Pretoria;\n1\nPart III\nof Schedule 2 lists rape as an offence.\n2\n115 (1998) pp 116-128.\n3\nSALJ\nop cit at 117.\n4\nSALJ\nop cit at 118.\n5\nS v Ndlovu\n2003 (1) SACR 331\n(SCA) paras 13-14;\nS v\n\tMvelase\n2004 (2) SACR 531\n(W) at 534-535;\nS v Ndlovu\n2004\n\t(2) SACR 70\n(W) at 76;\nS v Legoa\n2003 (1) SACR 13\n(SCA) at 25\n\tpara 27.\n6\nIn\nJefferies v Komgha Divisional Council\n1958 (1) 240 (A) at\n\t240G-H this court excluded reasons provided subsequent to the appeal\n\tbeing lodged and stated that it was confined\nto the four corners of\n\tthe record.",

    "facts": "Alex Aubrey Maake was convicted on 4 June 2002 by a regional magistrate in Benoni of a single count of rape and a separate count of robbery. The magistrate sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment for the rape and 5 years' imprisonment for the robbery, ordering the sentences to run cumulatively (totaling 20 years). Maake appealed both convictions and the sentence to the Pretoria High Court. The High Court dismissed the conviction appeals but reduced the total imprisonment to 16 years by allowing four years of the robbery sentence to run concurrently with the rape sentence. Maake subsequently sought leave to appeal the sentence to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which was granted.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two principal issues: (1) whether the magistrate correctly imposed a 15‑year sentence for a first‑offence rape in accordance with section 51 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997, including the requirement that any departure from the statutory minimum be properly justified; and (2) whether the magistrate complied with the statutory duty to provide reasons for imposing the maximum sentence, particularly identifying any aggravating circumstances warranting a departure from the prescribed minimum.",
    "principles": "Section 51(2)(b)(i) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act mandates a minimum term of 10 years for a first‑offence rape, with a proviso that the maximum may not exceed the minimum by more than five years (i.e., 15 years). Courts must articulate the aggravating factors that justify a sentence above the minimum and must give reasons for any such departure, as required by the principle of reasoned judgments articulated in cases such as S v Mbatha (2009) and supported by sections 146 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the Magistrates' Courts Act. Failure to provide adequate reasons undermines the fairness and transparency of sentencing.",
    "application": "The Supreme Court of Appeal found that the magistrate failed to identify any aggravating circumstances and did not provide the requisite reasons for imposing the 15‑year maximum sentence. The record showed no discussion of factors that would warrant a departure from the minimum, nor was the appellant or his counsel given an opportunity to make submissions on a maximum sentence. Consequently, the magistrate’s imposition of the maximum sentence was deemed irregular and set aside. The court substituted a sentence of ten years for the rape count, five years for the robbery count (with four years running concurrently with the rape sentence), and antedated the sentence to the date of conviction.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal against the convictions was dismissed. The appeal against the sentence was partially successful: the original sentence was set aside and substituted with ten years' imprisonment for the rape, five years for the robbery (four years concurrent), antedated to 4 June 2002. The court emphasized the necessity of providing reasons for sentencing decisions, especially when departing from prescribed minima."
