The organisation was restructured in 1995.\nBefore that date, VAT was paid on the product it supplied and\nthereafter,\nit was not. The cardinal question in this appeal is\nwhether VAT was payable in respect of the product sold after the\nrestructuring.\n[2]\tThe various components of the organisation making up\nThe Holiday Club from time to time, have varied. In 1993 Leisure\nProperty\nTrust ('the trust') was formed. The trust acquired rights to\naccommodation introduced to it by TCT Leisure (Pty) Ltd (to which,\nwithout\nbegging the question, I shall refer as 'the taxpayer') and in\nreturn for which the trust issued 'points rights' to the taxpayer.\nThese points rights conferred a contractual right of occupation\nenforceable against the trust exercisable subject to defined\nconditions.\nThe taxpayer sold the points rights to members of the\npublic. It was common cause before this court that these transactions\nconstituted\na 'taxable supply' on which VAT was payable; and VAT was\nin fact paid. The relevant provisions of the Value-Added Tax Act 89\nof 1991\nread:\n'7(1)\tSubject to the exemptions,\nexceptions, deductions and adjustments provided for in this Act,\nthere shall be levied and paid for\nthe benefit of the National\nRevenue Fund a tax, to be known as the valued-added tax â\n(a) on the supply by any vendor\nof goods or services supplied by him on or after the commencement\ndate in the course or furtherance\nof any enterprise carried on by\nhim;\n. . .\ncalculated at the rate of 14 per\ncent on the value of the supply concerned . . . .'\n1\n[3]\tWhen The Holiday Club was restructured in 1995 a new\ncompany, Leisure Holiday Club Ltd ('LHC'), was formed. The trust\nbecame its\nsole ordinary shareholder. The taxpayer transferred\nproperties and rights of use in properties comprising holiday\naccommodation,\nwhich it owned, to LHC for a consideration of R27,5m\nconsisting of the issue to the taxpayer of 62 500 preference\nshares in\nLHC with a nominal value of one cent each ('the shares')\nand 62 500 'debentures'\n2\nwith a face value of R439,99 each. These properties and rights of use\nin properties were then acquired by the trust from LHC; and\nthe\ntaxpayer began selling the shares (and possibly the 'debentures')\nwhich it had acquired in LHC, to members of the public. It\nis in\nrespect of the turnover from these sales, for the financial years\nending February 1998 to February 2002, that the Commissioner\nissued\nthe revised assessments levying VAT which are at issue in this\nappeal.\n[4]\tThe Commissioner raised the assessments on the basis\nthat the taxpayer dealt in 'timeshare interests' which were included\nin the\ndefinition of 'fixed property' in the VAT Act and,\naccordingly, that those interests were 'goods' and their supply fell\nwithin the\npurview of s 7(1) of the Act.\n3\nThe basis of the assessments was unanimously upheld by the Special\nTax Court, Durban (Hurt J presiding). Leave to appeal to this\ncourt\nwas subsequently granted in terms of s 34 of the VAT Act read with s\n86A(2)(b)(i) and s 86(5) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962.\n[5]\tBecause of the view I take it is unnecessary to\nconsider the correctness of the basis of the order made by the\nSpecial Tax Court\nbecause even if the basis was incorrect, as\ncontended by the taxpayer (and I express no view in this regard), the\nonus was on the\ntaxpayer, in terms of s 37 of the VAT Act,\n4\nto prove that the turnover from the sales was nevertheless exempt.\nThis the taxpayer sought to do by arguing that what was supplied\nto\nthe members of the public were 'financial services' in the form of\n'equity securities', as defined in s 2, which were exempt from\nVAT in\nterms of s 12(a) of the Act. Those provisions read inter alia:\n'12.\tThe supply of any of the\nfollowing goods or services shall be exempt from the tax imposed\nunder s 7(1)(a):\n(a)\tThe supply of any financial\nservices . . . .'\n'2(1)\tFor the purpose of this\nAct, the following activities shall be deemed to be financial\nservices:\n. . .\n(d)\tthe issue, allotment or\ntransfer of ownership of an equity security . . .\n. . .\n(2)\tFor the purposes of subsec\n(1) â\n. . .\n\"equity security\"\nmeans any interest in or right to a share in the capital of a\njuristic person . . . .'\n[6]\tIn the words of counsel who drew the heads of\nargument on behalf of the taxpayer:\n'The essential question is\nwhether the basis of the scheme was changed [in 1995] to one in which\n\"shares\" rather than \"points\"\nwere sold.'\nPut differently, in order to succeed, the taxpayer would\nhave had to show that the occupation rights formed part of the bundle\nof\nincorporeal rights comprising the shares in LHC which the taxpayer\nsold to members of the public. The source of such rights could\nonly\nbe found in the memorandum or articles of association of LHC\n5\nor in any valid resolution passed in accordance with the memorandum\nand articles setting out the rights attaching to the shares to\nbe\nissued pursuant to the resolution.\n6\n[7]\tAt the time LHC was incorporated, the terms\ngoverning the shares were set out in clause 3 of its original\narticles of association.\nThat clause gave the right to shareholders\nto use the property of the company in the following terms:\n'3(a)\tThe preference shareholder\nshall:\n1.\tBe entitled to use any\nproperty acquired by the company for leisure or holiday purposes in\naccordance with a schedule of use to\nbe prepared by the directors of\nthe company, which schedule shall ensure that each shareholder has\nequal access to the use and enjoyment\nof the property, determined pro\nrata to the number of shares held . . . .'\nHowever by special resolution passed on 15 September\n1995, which was before any shares at issue in this appeal were issued\nand therefore\nbefore the taxpayer sold such shares to members of the\npublic, clause 3 was amended to exclude the paragraph just quoted.\n[8]\tThe articles of LHC did not provide that the\nshareholder would be entitled to an allocation of points rights pro\nrata to its shareholding\nâ indeed, there is no link between the two\nin the articles (or memorandum) of LHC. Certificates issued to\nmembers of the public\nread as follows:\n'Share Certificate\nThis is to certify that the\nundermentioned is the registered owner of fully paid Preferent Shares\nof one cent each in the abovementioned\nCompany subject to the\nMemorandum and Articles of Association of the Company.\nPoints Rights Certificate\nSubject to the payment of\nMembership and Reservation Fees, this certificate also entitles the\nholder to the equivalent user rights\nin Points in The Holiday Club.'\n[9]\tClause 1 of the standard sale agreement between the\ntaxpayer and members of the public read:\n'The Trading Company [the\ntaxpayer] hereby sells to the Investor who hereby purchases in\nperpetuity upon the terms and conditions\nof this Agreement a share\ninterest in the Company [LHC], referred to as Points Rights in the\nScheme, which entitles him/her to be\ncredited each year with the\nnumber of Points as determined in Schedule 2 hereto.'\nCertain of the concepts are defined as follows:\n'Points Rights\nâ means a right for the Member to be credited each year with the\nnumber of Points specified in the Points Rights/Share Certificate;\nPoints/Shares\nâ means the instrument by means of which the Member of\nPoints/Shares becomes entitled to exercise the right to the Use and\nOccupation\nof Accommodation;\nScheme\nâ means a property time-sharing scheme known as \"The Holiday\nClub\" pertaining to the Accommodation conducted in terms\nof the\nrules thereto;\nAccommodation\nâ means the property, immovable or otherwise, intended for use by\nany Member in any Resort, including the movables, and in respect\nof\nwhich the Accommodation is owned, leased, rented or otherwise\navailable from time to time by the Trust and are accordingly included\nin the Scheme.'\nFrom what I have previously said it is quite clear that\nit was not the 'share interest in the Company' (ie LHC) referred to\nin clause\n1 of the standard sale agreement which entitled the member\nof the public 'to be credited each year with points rights' which, in\nturn, entitled the member to accommodation rights in terms of the\nscheme. The points rights conferred such entitlement. What was\nsold\nwere shares and points rights. As Mr Fernandes, the company secretary\nof the taxpayer (called to testify on its behalf), correctly\nsaid in\ncross-examination:\n'CROSS-EXAMINER:\tI'd just like\nto put it to you for any further comment you wish to make that after\n1995, if you sold shares, what\nyou sold were 1 cent preference shares\nand points.\nMR FERNANDES:\tAnd?\nCROSS-EXAMINER:\tAnd points, the\nsame points that you'd been selling before you continued to sell but\nyou tagged on to it a 1 cent\npreference share.\nMR FERNANDES:\tCorrect. The\npoints for accommodation and the shares for ownership.'\nThe fact that the taxpayer as a matter of commercial\npractice only sold points together with shares (a fact much\nemphasized in the\nheads of argument and by counsel who represented\nthe taxpayer when the matter was argued in this court) does not\nresult in a merger\nof the rights attaching to each, nor does it\nentitle the shareholder qua shareholder to exercise the right of a\npoints holder or\na points holder to exercise the rights of a\nshareholder.\n[10]\tCounsel representing the taxpayer when the appeal\nwas argued before this court relied on the decision of the New\nZealand Court\nof Appeal in\nCommissioner of\nInland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd\n.\n7\nIn that matter one member of a group of companies sold to the public\nredeemable preference shares in another member that operated\na golf\nclub and related facilities. The rights attached to each share, which\npassed to the purchaser, included membership of the\nclub. The issue\nwas whether such sales were to be treated as a supply of financial\nservices for the purposes of the Goods and Services\nTax Act 1985. The\nhigh court had held that the supplier of a share in a company\noperating a country club was an equity security and\nthat the\ntransaction was, therefore, an exempt supply of financial services\nfor GST purposes. The Commissioner's primary submission\non appeal was\nthat what was supplied in substance was membership of the golf club\nand that this supply should attract GST; that the\nequity security\nelement was ancillary to, or incidental to, the supply of membership\nof the club; and alternatively, that there were\ntwo supplies in the\ntransaction namely the supply of an equity security and the supply of\nmembership of the golf club. The Commissioner's\nappeal was dismissed\nand the Court of Appeal held inter alia that how the offer was\nmarketed and why people purchased the shares\nwas irrelevant, in that\neveryone who buys a share in a company buys it to acquire the rights\nattaching to that share; that the share\nis in all cases a 'vehicle'\nfor acquisition of the rights attached to it; and the fact that in\nthis case the rights attached to the\nshares were rights to membership\nin the country club did not alter what the purchasers were acquiring.\nThe high court's view that\nthere was no evidence to support the\nsupply of more than the shares was confirmed and the Court of Appeal\nheld that the right to\nmembership passed not as a discrete element,\nbut as an incident of share ownership.\n[11]\tIn the present matter I have held that the right to\noccupy was supplied not as an incident of share ownership, but as a\ndiscrete\nelement (in the form of points rights). The case is for that\nreason of no assistance to the taxpayer.\n[12]\tIt was in dispute whether, at the same time that\nshares and, as I have found, points rights were sold to members of\nthe public,\nthe 'debentures' acquired by the taxpayer in LHC were\nalso sold. It is not necessary to resolve the dispute nor is it\nnecessary to\nestablish a value for the shares. The VAT Act makes\nexpress provision for a composite supply of goods which are subject\nto VAT and\nthose that are not in s 10(22) which reads as follows:\n'Where a taxable supply is not\nthe only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be\ndeemed to be for such part of\nthe consideration as is properly\nattributable to it.'\nBut the Taxpayer conceded that if the rights to\naccommodation supplied to members of the public did not form part of\nthe rights attaching\nto the shares, the full consideration paid by\nmembers of the public was subject to VAT.\n[13]\tThe appeal is dismissed with costs including the\ncosts of two counsel.\n_______________\nT D CLOETE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nAPPELLANTS:\t\tK J Kemp SC (with him I Pillay)\nInstructed by Cox Yeats, Durban;\nMcIntyre & Van der Post, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENTS:\t\tO L Rogers SC (with him Ms A A Gabriel)\nInstructed by The State Attorney, Cape Town;\nThe State Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\nSection 7(1) has been reproduced in its present\n\tform. The amendments to it from time to time since its commencement\n\tare irrelevant\nto the present appeal.\n2\nIt is not necessary for purposes of the appeal to\n\tdecide whether this description is accurate.\n3\nIn s 1 of the VAT Act, 'goods' are defined as\n\tmeaning inter alia 'fixed property'; and 'fixed property' is defined\n\tas meaning inter\nalia 'in relation to a property time-sharing\n\tscheme, any time-sharing interest as defined in section 1 of the\n\tProperty Time-sharing\nControl Act, 1983 (Act 75 of 1983), and any\n\treal right in any such . . . time-sharing interest.'\n4\nSection 37 provides:\n'The burden of proof\n\tthat any supply . . . is exempt from or not liable to any tax\n\tchargeable under this Act . . . shall be upon\nthe person claiming\n\tsuch exemption . . . and upon the hearing of any appeal from any\n\tdecision of the Commissioner, the decision\nshall not be reversed or\n\taltered unless it is shown by the appellant that the decision is\n\twrong.'\n5\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue v Crossman & others:\n\tCommissioners of Inland Revenue v Mann & others\n[1936] 1 All\n\tER 762\n(HL) at 787;\nWessels & 'n ander v D A Wessels &\n\tSeuns (Edms) Bpk & andere\n1987 (3) SA 530\n(T) at 561G-H;\nLetseng Diamonds Ltd v JCI Ltd & others; Trinity Asset\n\tManagement (Pty) Ltd & others v Investec Bank Ltd & others\n2007 (5) SA 564\n(W) para 17.\n6\nBlackman et al\nCommentary on the Companies Act\nad s 91 p\n\t5â174-1; Morse et al\nPalmer's Company Law\npara 6.104.\n7\n[2003] UKPC 32\n;\n(2004) 21 NZTC 18\n, 915.",

    "facts": "The Holiday Club, a time‑share operator, restructured in 1995 creating Leisure Holiday Club Ltd (LHC). The sole shareholder of LHC was a trust that received from TCT Leisure (the taxpayer) property and usage rights in exchange for 62,500 preference shares (R0.01 each) and 62,500 debentures. The taxpayer then sold these preference shares, together with separate \"points rights\" that entitled the purchaser to annual accommodation allocations, to members of the public. The Commissioner assessed VAT on the turnover from these sales for the periods ending February 1998 to February 2002, arguing that the sales constituted supplies of goods (timeshare interests) under the VAT Act.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the consideration received for the preference shares and points rights is exempt from VAT under the ‘equity security’ exemption in section 12(a) of the VAT Act. 2. Whether the points rights form part of the bundle of rights attaching to the preference shares, thereby qualifying the whole transaction as a supply of an equity security. 3. Whether the composite supply rules in section 10(22) affect the tax treatment of the transaction.",
    "principles": "The court considered section 7(1) of the VAT Act, which imposes VAT on supplies of goods and services, and section 12(a), which exempts supplies of financial services, including the issue, allotment or transfer of an equity security as defined in section 2(1)(d). Section 37 places the burden of proof on the person claiming exemption. Section 10(22) deals with composite supplies, attributing consideration to each element. The court also referred to the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd, which held that a share whose attached rights constitute club membership is still an equity security and the supply is exempt.",
    "application": "The judge examined the articles of association of LHC and the share certificates, which showed that preference shares conferred no entitlement to accommodation; instead, a separate points rights certificate provided that entitlement. The special resolution of 15 September 1995 removed any clause linking share ownership to usage rights. Consequently, the points rights were not part of the equity security. The taxpayer therefore failed to meet the burden of proof under section 37 to show an exemption. The composite supply provision was irrelevant because the non‑exempt element (points rights) attracted VAT on the entire consideration.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel. The turnover from the sale of preference shares and points rights remains subject to VAT."
