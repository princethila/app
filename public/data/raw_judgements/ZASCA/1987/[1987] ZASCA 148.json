In terms of sec 56(1) (c)\nof the Act any\nperson who, without the consent of the\nMinister of Law and Order, is in\npossession of\n\"any publication published or disseminated by or under the direction or\nguidance or on behalf of any unlawful organization\"\nshall be guilty of an offence.\nThe discovery in appellant's possession of a\nbook bearing the title\n\"Island in Chains\" led to her ap-\npearance in a regional court, charged with\ncontravening\nsec 56(1) (c). She pleaded not guilty. In a statement\nhanded\nto the court her defence was set out in the fol-\nlowing terms :\n\"7\t3\n3.\n\"7. In my defence, I state that I did not know, nor did I have reason to\nbelieve that it was unlawful to possess a copy of the said\npublication.\n8. I state further that I deny that the\npublication was published, or dissemi-nated by, or under the direction, or\nguidance, or on behalf of the African National Congress.\"\nOn both the issues. thus raised, the court found against\nthe appellant.\nShe was convicted and the conviction was\nsubsequently confirmed on appeal to\nthe Transvaal Provin-\ncial Division, which, however, granted the appellant\nleave\nto appeal to this court.\nThe judgment in the court a\nquo\nwas not repor-\nted but the court's\ninterpretation of sec 56(1) (c) and\nits views on the form of\nmens rea\nrequired for the contra-\nvention\t4\n4. vention thereof appear from\nS v Mabitselo\n1985(4) S A\n61 (T). (\nMabitselo's\nappeal was heard on the same day and by the same\njudges who heard the appellant's appeal and the two cases were argued together).\nI mention the interpretation of sec 56(1) (c) and the form of\nmens rea\nrequired for its contravention since these were the two matters with which\nthe regional court and the court a\nquo\nwere mainly concerned. The section\nis aimed at the pos-session pf any publication published or disseminated by or\nunder the direction or guidance\nor\non behalf of\nan un-lawful\norganization. \"Island in Chains\" was alleged by the State to have been published\nor disseminated\non behalf of\nthe A N C and, in order to decide whether\nthis was indeed\nthe\t5\n5. the case, the meaning of \"on behalf of\" in sec 56(1) (c) first\nhad to be ascertained. Both courts construed the words as meaning\n\"for the\nbenefit\" or \"in the in-terest \" or \"to the advantage of\" and found, on this\n\"construction, that the book had been published\nor dis-seminated on behalf of\nthe A N C. The question of\nmens rea\nthen arose. The regional court held\n(and the court a\nquo\nagreêd) that\nmens rea\nin the form of\nculpa\nwas suf-ficient. Its actual finding on the type of\nmens rea\nwhich the appellant had, will be dealt with at a later stage.\nThe conviction was challenged in this court\non\t6\n6.\non four alternative grounds. I shall deal with them in\nthe sequence in which they were presented.\nThe main submission related to the interpreta-\ntion of the words \"on behalf of\" in sec 56(1) (c). I re-\nferred earlier to the trial court's interpretation of the\nwords in\nquestion. It derived from a passage in the judg-\nment of INNES CJ in\nDe\nVisser v Fitzpatrick\n1907 T S 355\nat p 363 where it was said that\n\"(the) popular meaning of those words is that everything done for a man's\nbenefit or in his interest or to his advantage is a thing\ndone on his behalf. On\nthe other hand, the more legal view is that they mean something done by a man's\nrepresentative or agent.\"\nWhereas the trial court adopted the so-called popular\nmeaning, appellant's counsel contended for the \"legal\"\ninterpretation....7\n7. interpretation by submitting that a publication is pub-lished or\ndisseminated on behalf of an unlawful organi-zation as contemplated\nin sec 56(1)\n(c), not when it ser-ves the interest or is for the benefit or to the advantage\nof the organization, but when it is\npublished or dissemi-nated by its agent or\nby someone (like an independent contractor) engaged or \"sponsored\" by the\norganization.\nThe recent decision of this court in\nS v Moloi and\nanother\n1987(1) S A 196 (A D) disposes of this submis-sion. In that case\nBOSHOFF AJA, in whose judgment two other members of the court concurred,\napproved of the judg-ment in\nMabitselo's\ncase (\nsupra\n) and adopted\nthe very in-terpretation of \"on behalf of\" in the context of sec 56(1)\n(c) \t8\n8. (c) which appellant's counsel sought to avoid. Faced with this,\ndifficulty appellant's counsel took a curious course. He was unable\nto refer us\nto any error in the judgment which could have a bearing on the decision ar-rived\nat therein; he had no answer to BOSHOFF\nAJA's reasoning to the effect that \"on\nbehalf of\" in the Eng-lish text of sec 56(1) (c) has to be reconciled with \"ten\nbehoewe van\"\nin the Afrikaans text; that, according to several well known\ndictionaries, \"ten behoewe van\" is not capable of any meaning other\nthan \"in the\ninterest of\" or \"to the advantage of\" or \"for the benefit of\", and that a\nreconciliation between the two texts can only\nbe effected if \"on behalf of\" is\ninterpreted as synonomous\nwith'.\t9\n9. with the English expressions which I have just used. Thus,\nwithout suggesting any reason why the decision should not be followed,\nappellant's counsel asked us to consider the question afresh. It is difficult,\nto say the least, to differ from a decision of this\ncourt which all the\ningenuity of counsel could not fault. I am unable to find any reason for doing\nso. I agree with the reasoning\nand decision in\nMoloi's\ncase and the main\nsubmission can, accordingly, not be sustained.\nThe alternative submissions\nwere advanced on the basis of the correctness of the trial courb's\ninterpre-tation of sec 56(1) (c). The\nfirst two may conveniently\nbe\t10\n10. be discussed together. By way of introduction mention should be\nmade of the fact that the magistrate based his finding that \"Island\nin Chains\"\nwas published or dissemi-nated in the interest or for the benefit or to the\nadvan-tage of the A N C entirely on his own\nperception of the tenor of the book.\nAppellant's counsel submitted that such a finding could not be made in the\nabsence of evidence\nto show what the interests of the A N C are. What is\nlack-ing, so he argued, is evidence relating to the aims and objectives of the\norganization. He submitted, moreover, that the tenor of the book alone is not\nsuch that a find-ing could be made that it would serve\nthe interests of the A N\nC or that the latter would reap any benefit or\nadvantage\t11\n11.\nadvantage from its publication and dissemination. These submissions\nare without substance. Any publication which seêks to advance\nthe cause of\nan organization, whether it be by enlisting popular support or by engendering\nsympathy for it or by extolling the justness\nof its cause,obviously serves the\ninterests of the organization, whatever its in-terests may be; such a\npublication is plainly for\nits benefit and to its advantage. And \"Island in\nChains\" is precisely such a publication. It was written by Indres Naidoo, a\nmember\nof the A N C, with the assistance,accor-ding to the foreword, of Albie\nSachs,\"a lawyer who was him-self imprisoned and banned in\nSouth Africa\". Naidoo,\nso the reader is informed in the foreword, was \"one of the\nfirst\t12\n12.\nfirst volunteers for Umkhonto we Sizwe, 'Spear of the Nation',\nthe armed wing of the African National Congress\". Caught\nin the act of attempting to blow up certain railway instal-\nlations, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to ten years'\nimprisonment, the best part of which he served on Robben\nIsland. After his release he left the country and told\nhis experiences to\nSachs. It is said in the foreword that\nhe and Sachs then\"grouped the themes\ninto chapters, and\nso produced this book. It is a narrative of one of\nthe\ncentral episodes of recent South African history, the\nstory of an\nisland in chains, the story of resistance as\nseen through the eyes of one who\nlived through it all for\nten years\". It is unnecessary to describe Naidoo's\nnarra-\ntive\t13\n13.\ntive of his experiences from the time of his arrest to\nthe time of his release,in this judgment. A description\nof the message which the book conveys, appears in the\nforeword (written by Francis Meli, the Director of Exter-\nnal Publicity of\nthe A N C). It reads as follows:\n\"This book is the voice of struggle, the voice of the oppressed, the voice of\nthe future, It expresses what is embodied and crystallized\nin our slogans :\n'Amandla Nga-wethu', 'Maatla Kea Rona', 'Power to the\nPeople' : \tIt simply means 'Mayibuye i\nAfrika' - we are determined to seize power.\nIt is a declaration of\nconfidence in our\njust cause\t.\"\nIn order to confirm the accuracy of this description I\nshall refer to only\none passage in the book where Naidoo\ntells of an incident when he met members\nof the Black\nConsciousness\t14\n14.\nConsciousness Movement in what he calls a \"transit cell\".\nIt reads as\nfollows :\n\"They want to find out if the rumours they have heard about the Island are\ntrue and how they sh.ould conduct themselves when they\nget there. So we tell\nthem that some of the hard times and terrible suf-fering have passed because of\nour struggles, and we stress\nthat there is only one way to get through, and that\nis to remember, each and every day, that they are political prisoners fighting\nfor a just cause, that they must always stand together and never lose sight of\ntheir goal. We remind them that the people of South\nAfrica, and of the world,\nwill always be standing by them,that they will never be forgotten, however\niso-lated they might feel, and\nthat we are con-fident that the A N C will\ncontinue the fight and bring victory to the people of our country.\"\nThere can be no doubt whatsoever that this\nbook\nserves\t15\n15. serves the interest of the A N C or that it is to the advantage or for\nthe benefit of the organization.\nWhat remains for consideration is the\nquestion of\nmens rea\nin the\ncontext of the appellant's statement that she \"did not know, nor had reason to\nbe-lieve that it was unlawful to possess a\ncopy of the said publication\". The\nmagistrate ruled that\nculpa\non the part of the possessor may constitute\nthe mental element of thë offence of being in possession of a publication\nin contravention\nof sec 56(1) (c), and in effect found that the appellant\nought to have known\nthat it was un-lawful to possess a copy of \"Island in\nChains\" .\nThe\t16\n16. The question is whether his ruling on the sufficiency of\nculpa\nis\ncorrect.\nThe magistrate ruled and counsel who argued the appeal were in\nagreement that sec 56(1) (c) does not impose so-called strict liability.\nIn the\nabsence of clear indications to the contrary in the Act, the presump-tion\nagainst an intention to impose that kind of liability\nmust prevail (\nS v\nArenstein\n1964(1) S A 361 at p 365) and I agree with the magistrate that\nmens rea\nis an element of the offence.\nThere is no indication in sec 56(1) (c) of\nthe form of\nmens rea\nrequired but, as BOTHA JA stated in\nArenstein's\ncase (at p 366) :\n\"\tit \t17\n17.\n\"\tit is clear that\n'negligence may constitute sufficient proof of\nmens rea\neven in cases\nwhere negligence is not the gist of the offence charged, if there was a duty on\nthe part of the person\ncharged to be circumspect\t'\n- per CENTLIVRES JA in\nR v H supra\nat p 130.-\nThe degree of blameworthiness required for a culpable violation of a\nstatutory pro-hibition or injunction must in the first place\nbe sought in the\nlanguage used by the law-\ngiver \t and in the absence of any words\nexpressly indicating the particular mental state required, the degree of\nmens rea\nmust depend on that foresight or care which the statute in the\ncircumstances demands.\"\nSee also\nS v Jassat\n1965(3) S A 423 (A D),\nS v Qumbella\n1966(4) S A 356 (A D),\nS v Marais\n1971(1) S A 844 (A D)\nat p 851,\nS v Oberholzer\n1971(4) S A 602 (A D) at p 612.\nAccording to these\ndecisions\nculpa\nmay be sufficient if\nit appears that a high degree of\ncircumspection or care\nis\t18\n18. is demanded for the observance of a statutory prohi-bition or injunction.\nWhether that is so depends upon the intention of the\nlegislature.\nSec 56(1)\n(c) appears in an Act which, ac-cording to its long title, was passed to provide\nfor the security of the State and the maintenance\nof law and or-der and for\nmatters connected therewith. A large variety of matters, all related somehow or\nother to the security of\nthe State or the maintenancê of law and order,\nare pro-vided for in different parts of the Act. For presentpur-poses reference\nneed only be made to some of the provi-sions relating to unlawful\norganizations..\nIf the Minister of Law and Order is satisfied\nthat\t19\n19.\nthat the activities of an organization endanger or are\ncalculated to endanger the safety of the State or the maintenance of law and\norder, he may declare it an unlaw-\nful organization. (Sec 4(1).) One of the\neffects of such a declaration is that no-one may thereafter take part in the\nactivities of\nthe organization or carry on in its direct or indirect interest\nany activity in which it was or could have engaged (sec 13(1) (a)\n(iv)); or\nadvocate, advise defend or encourage the achievement of any of its objects (sec\n13(1) (a) (v)). What the legis-lature sought\nto achieve by these measures is\nclear. A declaration in terms of sec 4(1) will not necessarily bring about the\ndiscontinuance of\nthe activities of the\norganization\t20\n20. organization. For that reason sec 13(1) (a) (iv) was\nintroduced. The legislature deemed it necessary, more-over, to prevent the\npropagation of the achievenent of the organization's objectives. To that end it\nintroduced sec 13(1) (a) (v).\nSec 56(1) (c) could only have been intended\nto bolster secs 13(1) (a) (iv)\nand (v). Although it is conceivable that the kind of publication at which it is\naimed was considered\nto be so harmful or potentially harm-ful that no-one should\neven be allowed to possess it , it is more likely that the prohibition\nwas\nintended as an impediment to the continuation of an organization's acti-vities\nafter a declaration in terms of sec 4(1) and to\nthe\t21\n21. the propagation of the achievement of its objectives. The\nsection thus forms part of the legislature's scheme to combat these\nevils, for\nthe protection of the State and for the maintenance of law and order. One is\ntemp-ted to say, therefore, that a high degree\nof circumspec-tion is required\nfor the observance of the prohibition and, applying the principle stated in the\ncases mentioned earlier,\nthat\nculpa\non the part of the possessor of a\npro-hibited publication is sufficient to justify his convic-tion for\ncontravening sec 56(1) (c).\nThe problem pre-sented by the present case cannot,\nhowever, be solved in this way. A closer look at the section is required in\norder\nto discover what it entails.\nWhat\t22\n22.\nWhat is prohibited therein is the\npossession\n(without the Minister's consent) of\nany\npublication\npub-\nlished\nor\ndisseminated by\nor\nunder the direction\nor gui-\ndance\nor on\nbehalf of\n(in the sense explained\nearlier)\nan unlawful organization\n. The complexity of the\ndes-\ncription of a prohibited publication becomes apparent im-\nmediately.\nTo identify a publication as a prohibited one\nmay in many cases prove to be\nextremely difficult if not\nimpossible. This problem is aggravated by the fact\nthat\nno unlawful organization and no-one acting in its inte-\nrests will\nopenly disseminate publications, the posses-\nsion of which is prohibited, and\nwill much rather resort\nto covert measures to spread its philosophy or to\nadvance\nits\t23\n23.\nits aims. \"Island in Chains\" was eg printed, published and\nreproduced by reputable companies in England. Nothing is known about the\nmanner\nin which it was disseminated, nor is it known by whom this was done. It is for\nthis very reason that the State could only\nallege and prove, by reference to the\ncontents of the book itself, that it was published and disseminated\non behalf\nof\nthe A N.C. And in many cases the contents of the publication will not be\nso revealing. \"Island in Chains\" is a crude example of A\nN C propaganda but in\nother publications the approach may be more subtle. Indeed, any publication\npublished or disseminated by or\nunder the direction or guidance of an unlawful\norganization - even a religious treatise\nor\t24\n24. or a textbook on the industrial law - is prohibited. It will often be\nwholly impossible to know or even to suspect that it may\nnot be lawfully\npossessed, or to find out whether it may.\nEvery prohibited publication is,\nmoreover, related in sec 56(1) (c) to an unlawful organization. As mentioned\nearlier, an organization\nis\ndeclared\nto be an unlawful one. The\ndeclaration is published in the Gazette. Although many of these organizations\nare prob-ably known to the\naverage South African, others undoub-tedly are not.\nAppellant's counsel supplied us with a list containing the names of some of\nthem.\nThe list in-cludes some well known names. It also includes the names\nof\t25\n25. of \"Dance Association\", 5 A A Football League\", \"Foot-ball\nClub\",\"Football League\",\"Educational and Cultural Advancement of the\nAfrican\nPeople in S A\" and \"Zimele Trust Fund\". Personally I have never heard these\nnames before and I am sure that many others share\nmy ignorance. What is more\nimportant, is that the names suggest nothing -at least not what the activities\nof thesê organizations\nare. If I were to receive a book openly published\nby the \"S A A Football League\" I would, unless its contents are as revealing as\nthe contents of \"Island in Chains\",not have the faintest suspicion that it was\npublished by an organization which has been shown\nto the Minister's\nsatis-faction to have been engaged in activities endangering\nthe\t26\n26.\nthe safety of the State or the maintenance of law and order.\nI would not know, nor would I have reason to suspect, that I have in\nmy\npossession a publication pro-hibited in terms of sec 56(1) (c).\nViewed in the\ncontext of the question under discussion viz whether negligent violations of the\npro-hibition in sec 56(1) (c) have\nbeen penalized, the prob-lem now becomes\nclear. Negligence implies\ninter alia\nlack of reasonable foresight - in\nthis case lack of rea-sonable foresight of the possibility that a publication\nmay be a prohibited\none. From what I have said, the difficulty to foresee such a\npossibility must be appa-rent, . It is clear that, in cases where a\npublication\ncannot\t27\n27. cannot, by reference to its contents or to extraneous\ncircumstances,\nbe identified as a prohibited one, there can be no foresight that it may be. It\nis clear too that there is a very real\nlikelihood of such cases occur-ringJ\nPublications which are identifiable as prohibi-ted ones are not without\ndifficulty either. The\nques-tion is: by whom are they supposed to be\nidentifiable? If the so-called objective test of negligence is applied, as it\ngenerally\nis, the court hearing a case brought for an al-leged contravention of\nsec 56(1) (c) will be called upon to answer this question according\nto its own\nobjective assessment of the reasonableness of the accused's failure to identify\nthe publication; and in doing so, it will\nnot\t28\n28.\nnot take the accused's personal capabilities into ac-count\n(\nS v Ngubane\n1985(3) S A 677 (A D) at p 687); the unsophisticated and\nuneducated shepherd will be trea-ted no differently from the professor and\nno\nheed will be taken of the \"widely differing standards of culture, edu-\ncation\nand social awareness of the various groups of per-sons to whom, as citizens of\nSouth Africa, this Act ap-plies.\" (per FANNIN\nJ in\nS v Naidoo\n1974(4) S A\n574 (N) at p 576). On the magistrate's construction of sec 56(1), (c)such an\ninequitable result must have been inten-ded-by\nthé legislature. I find\nthat difficult to accept. (On that construction the same result would follow if\nan accused were to\nraise by way of defence his ignorance\nof\t29\n29. of the prohibition (cf\nS v de Blom\n1977(3) S A 513 (A D). I find\nit equally difficult to accept that that was intended). Taking everything into\naccount, I have come\nto the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to\ndemand the high degree of circumspection for the obser-vance of the prohibition\nwhich is required for an infe-rence that\nculpa\non the part of the\npossessor of a pro-\nhibited publication is sufficient to justify his\nconvic-tion. I am fortified in this view by the fact that sta-tutory\nprohibitions\nagainst the possession of certain ar-ticles or substances have\nalways in the past (except in one case) been interpreted in such a\nway that\nknowledge was required on the part of the possessor that\nwhat\t30\n30.\nwhat he has in his possession,. is the prohibited article\nor substance. It was said in\nS v Smith\n1965(4) S A\n166 (C) at p 171 that\n\"(t)he weight of this authority is undoub-\ntedly in favour of the general\nproposition\nthat, where a person is charged with the\ncontravention of a\nstatutory provision\nwhich prohibits the possession of certain\narticles\nexcept under special circumstan-\nces or under the authority of a\npermit,\nmens rea\n,\nin the sense of the accused per\n-\nson\nknowing that he has in his custody or\nunder his control the forbidden\narticle\n,\nis normally an essential ingredient of the\noffence\t\" (My\nitalics)\n(To the authorities referred to by the learned judge,\nmay be added\nS v\nMdeleleni\n1975(2) S A 682 (C),\nS v Cow\n-\nley\n1976(1) S A 376 (E),\nS v Lombard\n1980(3) S A 948 (T)\nand\nS v Ngwenya\n1979(2) S A 96 (A D). After the passing\nof\t31\n31. of the Act there were others.) In\nS v Goncalves\n1974 (2) S A 122::\n(NC)\nculpa\nwas held to be sufficient for\nthe unlawful possession of certain drugs. But the cor-\nrectness of the\ndecision was doubted (cf\nS v Lombarcf\n(\nsupra\n) at p 951-2 and the\njudgments of FANNINJ and VAN HEERDEN J in\nS v Naidoo\n(\nsupra\n)). The\nlegislature could hardly have been unaware that this was the state of the law\nand, had it been the intention to create in.\nsec 56(1) (c) yet another offence\nentailing the posses-sion of an article but with a different form of\nmens\nrea\n,\nit is unlikely that it would not have been expressly or\nat least clearly stated.\nI have accordingly come to the conclusion\nthat\t32\n32.\nthat\nmens rea\nin the form of\nculpa\non the part\nof the possessor of a prohibited publication is not sufficient to justify his\nconviction on a charge of contravening\nsec 56(1)(C). The magistrate found that\nthe appellant \"could, and should have realized, as a reasonable member of\nsociety that her\npossession o.f the book was unlawful\". In the absence of a\nfinding that she knew that her posses-sion was unlawful or foresaw that\nit might\nbe, the con-viction cannot be sustained.\nThe appeal is upheld and the conviction\nand sentence are set aside.\nJ J F HEFER JA.

    "facts": "The African National Congress (ANC) had been declared an unlawful organisation under the Internal Security Act No 74 of 1982. Section 56(1)(c) of that Act criminalises possession of any publication published or disseminated by, or on behalf of, an unlawful organisation without the Minister's consent. The appellant, Emily Elizabeth Melk, was found in possession of a book titled \"Island in Chains\" which the State alleged had been published on behalf of the ANC. She was charged under sec 56(1)(c), pleaded not guilty, and asserted that she neither knew nor had reason to believe the book’s possession was unlawful, and denied that the ANC was involved in its publication. The regional court convicted her; the conviction was affirmed by the Transvaal Provincial Division, which granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two primary legal issues: (1) the proper interpretation of the phrase \"on behalf of\" in sec 56(1)(c) – whether it means merely serving the benefit or interest of an unlawful organisation, or requires publication by an agent or representative of that organisation; and (2) the requisite mens rea for the offence – whether negligence (culpa) is sufficient, or whether actual knowledge or foresight of the illegality is required.",
    "principles": "The court considered previous authorities, notably S v Mabitselo and S v Moloi, which interpreted \"on behalf of\" as meaning \"for the benefit, interest or advantage\" of the unlawful organisation. It affirmed that the statutory language does not expressly prescribe a strict‑liability offence and that, in the absence of clear legislative intent, the presumption is that mens rea is required. The court drew on cases such as S v Arenstein, R v H, and S v Smith, establishing that knowledge or at least a high degree of circumspection is ordinarily needed for offences involving prohibited possession.",
    "application": "Applying the established interpretation, the court concluded that the book \"Island in Chains\" clearly served the ANC’s interests – it was written by an ANC member, endorsed by ANC officials, and promoted the organisation’s slogans and objectives. Hence it fell within the scope of a prohibited publication under sec 56(1)(c). Regarding mens rea, the court held that mere negligence was insufficient; the appellant needed to have known, or reasonably foreseen, that possession of such a publication was unlawful. Since the appellant claimed lack of knowledge and no evidence showed she should have reasonably foreseen the illegality, the conviction could not be sustained.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the appeal, set aside the conviction and the sentence, and affirmed that mens rea in the form of knowledge or foresight, not mere culpa, is required for a conviction under sec 56(1)(c) of the Internal Security Act."
