Since 11 July 1978\nrespondent has been re-gistered as\na vendor, in terms of sec. 12 of the Sales\nTax Act 103 of 1978 (\"the Act\"), in respect of the enterprises of manufacturing\nand wholesale\ntrading. In terms of the Act, which was promulgated on 28 June\n1978, liability for sales tax commenced on 3 July 1978 (see definition\nof\n\"commencement date\" in sec. 1).\nOn 18 February 1983 appellant, the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, issued\nrespondent with an additional assessment to sales tax in\nregard to the\nimportation by respondent of what are termed \"bladders\" during the period 3 July\n1978 to 4 May 1962. The taxable amount\nof these bladders was assessed in the sum\nof Rl 898 622 and the amount of sales tax payable in the sum of R107 469,16.\nOriginally\n/ penalties\n3.\npenalties were also claimed, but these were later waived by the\nappellant. Respondent objected to this assess-ment, generally on the\nground that\nthe bladders in ques-tion were not subject to sales tax. Its objection having\nbeen disallowed by appellant, respondent,\nin terms of sec. 22 of the Act,\nappealed to the Special Court constituted for the hearing of income tax appeals.\nThe appeal came.\nbefore the Natal Income Tax Special Court, which allowed the\nappeal and set aside the assessment. Appellant now appeals to this Court\nagainst\nthe whole of the judgment and order of the Special Court, the President of the\nSpecial Court having granted the necessary\nleave in terms of sec. 86 A(5) of the\nIncome Tax Act 58 of 1962, as amended.\nBefore dealing with the merits of the appeal, I must make brief mention of\ntwo matters. The first, an application by appellant for\nthe amendment of the\ngrounds of appeal, was not opposed by respondent and was granted at the\nbeginning of the hearing before us.\n/The\n4\nThe second was an application for condonation of the fact that, for reasons\nwhich I need not detail, the notice of appeal was lodged\nwith respondent's\nattorney one day late. This application was also not opposed by respondent and\nin my view condonation should be\ngranted. I turn now to the merits.\nThe essential facts of the matter are not in dispute. The bladders in\nquestion were imported by the respondent and used by it in the\ncourse of\nmanufacturlng\ntyres during the period for which the tax was levied; and indeed at the time\nof the trial the same type of bladder was currently in\nuse. In the process of\nmanufac-ture respondent uses fairly complex machines, which take in what is\ntermed the \"raw tyre\", shape and\ncure (or vulcanize) it and produce the finished\nproduct. There are two types of such a curing (or vulcanizing) machine, the\nBag-o-matic\nPress, which is only semi-automatic\n/ and\n5\nand requires several manual operations in its normal\nfunctioning, and the Autoform Press, which is completely automatic. Basically,\nhowever, these machines employ the same process. There are different machines\nfor the manufacture of different sizes of tyre. They\nvary in cost from R733 000\nfor the machine used to make tyres for very large earth-moving machines to R41\n500 for the machine used\nto make tyres for ordinary motor cars.\nIt is not necessary to describe the curing process in more than broad\noutline. The essential parts of the machine consist of a press\nand a mould. The\nmould is circular in form, is made of metal and comes in two halves. It is so\nshaped as to give the tyre its outward\nform, with its patterned tread, etc. At\nthe commencement of the process the two halves of the mould are separated from\none another,\nthe lower section\n/ lying\n6\nlying horizontal. In the centre of the lower section\nof the mould is\nplaced the bladder. The bladder consists\nof a rubber cylinder which in its\nuninflated state appears\nto have a diameter approximately the same as the\ncircular opening in the finished tyre into which the wheel will fit. The bladder\nis open at both ends. When the cylin-drical bladder is placed upright in the\nmould a steel plate is affixed to the opening at each\nend. The lower plate is\nscrewed into the base of the machine and lies at the same level as the bottom of\nthe lower section of the\nmould. The raw tyre, which consists of a cylinder about\nthe same height as the bladder, but of wider diameter, is then fitted over\nthe\nbladder. Thereafter the upper plate affixed to the bladder is clamped to a\ncentral ram which can move vertically. By means of\nthe ram the raw tyre is\ncompressed from above until eventually the two halves of the metal mould are\nbrought together.\n/ At\n7\nDuring the process of compression first steam and later hot water are\nintroduced under pressure into the bladder, and also externally.\nThe heat of the\nsteam initially causes the rubber of the raw tyre to become sufficiently molten\nto flow and be moulded. And the hot\nwater supplies the pressure and temperature\nrequired to cause the tyre, through the medium of the bladder, to assume the\nshape dictated\nby the mould. In this process the bladder inflates and expands\nand is contorted in such a way as to form a shape which applies the\nrequisite\npressure on the inside of the tyre. In that way it forces the tyre into and\nagainst the mould. Later when the curing process\nis complete cold water is\nintroduced to cool everything down and the finished tyre is removed.\nThe curing time varies with different tyres, depending upon size. Thus, for\nexample, with a very large tyre it could take 10½\nhours, compared with\nabout\n/27\n8\n27 to 30 minutes for a small tyre. The bladder undergoes considerable stress\nduring the curing process. It is subjected to stretching,\ncontortion and\ncontraction, and to high and low temperatures. After a time this stress tends to\ncause the bladder to crack round\nthe periphery and to split longitudinally. Once\nthis happens the bladder has to be replaced by a new one. The usable life of a\nbladder\nagain depends upon size.\nIn the case of the bladder used for making the small type of tyre, its life\nis normally about 300 to 310 curing cycles (ie, on the\nbasis of 27 minutes per\ncuring cycle, about 135 to 140 hours). On the other hand, the bladder used for\nmaking the very large type\nof tyre usually lasts for about 8 cures (ie, a total\nof about 84 hours). Some bladders might last for a longer time; others for a\nshorter time. The span of time over which a bladder would remain in a machine\nwould depend upon\n9\nhow continuously the machine was operated. Thus working 8 hours a day and 5\ndays a week (which would not normally be done) the bladder\nused on the small\nmachine would normally be replaced after 3½ weeks. The cost of a bladder\nagain varies, depending on size.\nIn the case of the large machine earlier\nreferred to, a bladder costs R9 800, ie. about 1,3% of the total cost of the\nmachine; and\nin the case of the small one, the cost is RlóO, ie 0,4% of\nthe total cost.\nThe only evidence led in the Court a\nquo\nwas that of Mr L Rust,\nrespondent's equipment engineer, who was called as a witness by respondent. The\naforegoing facts are gleaned\nmainly from his evidence. In addition, it would\nseem from what Rust stated that, when purchased, a curing machine does not come\nwith\na bladder attached. The bladder must be separately purchased. Whether the\nbladder, which is obviously designed to fit into the\n/ machine,\n10\nmachine, is produced by the manufacturer of the machine or by some\nother party is not clear. It also appears from Rust's evidence\nthat a single\nmachine may be designed to produce a range of different sizes of tyre, using\ndifferent moulds. Some bladders will accommodate\ndifferent sizes of tyre; in\nother instances the bladder has to be changed to fit a specific size of mould.\nNormally, however, the\nproduction programme would be so planned as to obviate as\nfar as possible changes of the bladder oh a particular machine. The operation\nof\nchanging the bladder is entrusted to semi-skilled operators.\nIt is common cause that the importation of such a bladder by the respondent\nconstitutes a transaction which would attract sales tax\nin terms of sec. 5 of\nthe Act, unless it fell within one of the exemptions provided for by sec. 6(1)\nof the Act. In this connection\nparas. (c) and (t)(iii) of sec. 6(1) appear to be\napplicable.\n/ In\n11\nIn each of these paragraphs an exemption is provided as regards goods (i)\nwhere the vendor is registered under sec, 12 in respect\nof an enterprise falling\nwithin a category of the enterprises mentioned in Schedule 2 to the Act, (ii)\nwhere the goods are goods\ndescribed in that Schedule in relation to such\ncategory and (iii) where the goods are intended for use or utilization in such\nenterprise.\nTo see whether either of these exemp-tions applies one must refer to\nSchedule 2 of the Act.\nAt this point it is relevant to note that the Act has been amended every year\nsince its enactment. Some of the amendments have been\ngiven retrospective\neffect. Since the period over which sales tax was asses-sed in this case spans\nabout 4 years it is necessary\nto consider what effect these amendments may have\nhad from time to time on respondent's liability for sales tax.\n/ Respondent\n12\nRespondent is registered under sec. 12 in respect\nof,\ninter alia\n, a manufacturing enterprise. Division\n1 of Schedule\n2 deals with manufacturing enterprises\nand sets forth the goods to which the\nexemption contained\nin sec. 6 applies. The relevant paragraph of Division\n1 is para. 3. In its original form para. 3 consisted\nof a single sentence. In terms of sec. 20(1)(b) of\nthe Sales Tax Amendment\nAct 111 of 1979, however, para.\n3 was amended by the introduction of a new subpara. (b),\nthe existing paragraph becoming subpara. (a), and by\nsec. 20(1)(c) of the same amending Act a proviso to par.\n3 was added. Act 111 of 1979 waa promulgated on 18\nJuly 1979, but it was provided in sec. 20(2) that sec.\n20(1)(b) should be deemed to have come into operation\non 3 July 1978 - the commencement date for the payment\nof sales tax. There was no similar provision in\nregard to the proviso. The upshot is that\nfor the period 3 July 1978 to 17 July 1979 para.\n/ 3(a)\n13\n3(a) and (b), as amended, but without the proviso, applies;\nwhereas as\nfrom 18 July 1979 para. 3(a) and (b) must be read with the proviso.\nI now quote para. 3, as amended by sec. 20(1)\nof Act 111 of 1979:\n\"3. (a) Any repair or maintenance service in respect of machinery or plant used\ndirectly in the manufacture, assembly or processing\nof goods for sale, and parts\npurchased for incorporation in or attachment to such machinery or plant in order\nto effect such service.\n(b) Parts purchased for incorporation in or attachment to such machinery or\nplant for the purpose of the repair or maintenance thereof\nby the vendor\ncarrying on the enterprise concerned.\nProvided that\nfor the purposes of this paragraph, parts purchased shall not include any goods\ndescribed in this Division under the\nheading of non-qualifying goods.\"\n/ In\n14\nIn addition to the amendments already referred to, sec. 20(1) of Act\n111 of 1979 also added at the end of Division I of Schedule 2\na list of the\n\"non-qualifying goods\" referred to in the proviso to para. 3. Two items in this\nlist are relevant:\n\"Detachable machine tools,\nCutting, forming, honing and moulding tools.\"\nThe Sales Tax Amendment Act 105 of 1980 (promul-gated on 1 August 1980)\neffected some minor amendments to para. 3. Two need be noted.\nFirstly the\nparagraph\nwas altered to include \"materials\" as well as \"parts\";\nand, secondly, the concluding words of subpara (a) were\naltered to read —\n\"\t in order to have such service\neffected.\"\nFinally, by sec. 9(1)(b) of the Second Sales Tax Amendment Act, 90 of 1982\n(promulgated on 16 June\n/ 1982)\n15\n1982) the list of non-qualifying goods was amended by the addition of the\nfollowing new item:\n\"(19) Curing bags, bladders and airbags.\" It is common\ncause that the bladders in issue fall under this item, with the result that\nas\nfrom 16 June 1982 respondent was unquestionably obliged to pay sales tax on all\nbladders imported by it. The dispute between the\nparties is thus confined to the\nposition prior to 16 June 1982.\nIt was agreed by counsel that subpara. 3(b), rather than subpara. 3(a), was\nthe relevant statutory provision in this matter, since\n3(a) relates to a repair\nor maintenance service provided by some third party, as opposed to 3(b), which\nrelates to repair or maintenance\nexecuted by the vendor himself. This is\ncertainly clear from para. 3(a), as amended in 1980, whatever the position may\nhave been\nbefore then; and I shall proceed on the\n/ basis\n16\nbasis that 3(b) is the relevant subparagraph. And, reverting for a moment\ntó the requireménts of sec. 6(1)(c) and sec.\n6(l)(t)(iii), it is\nfurther common cause that the bladders were intended to be used or utilized in\nrespondent's enterprise.\nAccordingly, the issues may be summed up as follows:\n(1) Did the bladders in question constitute parts purchased for incorporation\nin or attachment to the curing machines for \"the repair\nor maintenance thereof\"\nby respondent, the vendor carrying on the enterprise in question? ïf the\nanswer be in the negative,\nthen clearly the bladders were not exempt from sales\ntax and the appeal to this Court must succeed, irrespective of what answer might\nbe given to the question posed under (2) below.\n/ If\n17\nIf the answer be in the affirmative, then clearly for the period 3 July 1978 to\n17 July 1979 the bladders were exempt from sales\ntax and to that extent the\nappeal must fail; and, in addition, the further issue under (2) below must be\naddres-sed.\n(2) Did the bladders in question constitute either\n(a)\ndetachable machine tools,\nor\n(b)\ncutting, forming, honing or moulding\ntools?\nIf the answer be in the affirmative, then for\nthe period 18 July 1979 to 15 June 1982 the blad-\nders were not exempt from sales tax and the ap-\npeal succeeds in respect of bladders imported\nduring this period.\nIf the answer be in the negative, then the appeal\nmust fail in its entirety.\n/ As\n18\nAs to the first of these issues, I have no doubt that the bladders\nconstituted parts purchased for \"attachment to\" and possibly also\n\"incorporation\nin\", the curing machines by respondent. It is clear from the evidence that the\nbladder plays an essential role in\nthe functioning of the curing machine and in\nthe production of the finished tyre. Indeed, without the bladder the machine\ncannot\nfunction at all. The bladder itself is specially designed and\nmanufactured to fit into the machine and apart from the role which\nit piays in\nthe functioning of the machine it has no other purpose or function whatever.\nWhen in use, the bladder is firmly affixed\nto portions of the machine and\nconnected up with those parts which fill it with steam and hot water. It is\nunquestionably a part\nof the machine.\nI am also of the view that the purpose of such attachment (and possibly\nincorporation) is the \"repair\"\n/ or . . .\n19\nor \"maintenance\" of the machine by respondent. There were quoted to us a\nnumber of decisions, of both South African and English courts,\ndealing, in\nvarious contexts, with the meaning of the words \"repair\" and \"maintenance\"; and\nmy own researches have revealed a few\nmore. I do not propose to review these\ndecisions. \"Repair\" and \"maintenance\" are not words bearing precise meanings and\nmuch depends\nupon the context in which they are used (see eg. the discussion in\nthe House of Lords deci-sion of\nLondon and North Eastern Railway Company v\nBerriman\n1946 AC 278\nat pp. 291-2, 294-5,299-301; 307-8, 314-15).\nEnglish The Oxford/Dictionary defines \"repair\", as a noun and\nin the sense presently relevant, as —\n\"Restoration of some material thing or structure by the renewal of decayed or\nworn out parts, by refixing what has become loose or\ndetached, etc; the result\nof this.\"\n/ Webster's\n20\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary gives the following relevant\nmeanings for \"repair\" as verb and\nnoun:\n\"To restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken:\nFIX, MEND\"\nand\n\"the act or process of repairing: restora-tion to a state of soundness,\nefficiency or health\".\nThe relevant meaning given for \"maintenance\" in the Oxford English\nDictionary is —\n\"The action of keeping in effective con-\ndition, in working order, in repair, etc.; And the corresponding definition\nin Webster's work is —\n\"The labor of keeping something (as buildings or equipment) in a state of\nrepair or efficiency\".\nGenerally speaking, \"maintenance\" would cover\nacts of keeping in effective condition, etc. which fall\n/ short\n21\nshort of actual repair; but in certain areas the two concepts may well\noverlap and maintenance could include particular acts of repair;\nand\nvice\nversa\n. Since both words are used in the alternative in para. 3(b) it is not\nnecessary to attempt to draw a dividing line between \"repair\"\nand \"maintenance\".\nNor is it necessary to delimit their outer reaches for, in my view, the act of\nreplacing a worn or damaged bladder\nin one of respondent's curing machines\nclearly amounts to repair or maintenance of the machine in question, probably\nboth repair\nand maintenance. It involves the renewal of a worn out part and may\nalso be described as the action of keeping the machine in effective\ncondition\nand working order.\nIn argument appellant's counsel laid stress on the following facts: (i) that\nthe curing machine is purchased without a bladder and\nthe bladder is\npurchased\nseparately; (ii) that, when necessary in order to accom-\n/ modate\n22\nmodate different sizes of tyre, the bladder is removed from the machine and a\ndifferent—sized bladder substitu-ted; and (iii)\nthat the bladder is\ndesigned to be at-tached and detached by a semi-skilled operator. From this\ncounsel argued that the bladders\nwere separate and replaceable parts analogous\nto the replaceable bit of a power drill; and that the attachment of a bladder to\nthe\nmachine did not amount to the repair or maintenance of the machine.\nIt is true that the bladder is purchased separately from the machine, but, as\nI have indicated, it is never-theless from the functional\npoint of view an\nintegral part of the machine. And I do not think that the fact that it can be\nattached or removed by a semi-skilled\noperator detracts from this. One can\nvisualize many parts of different kinds of machine, eg. a spark-plug in a\npetrol-driven lawnmower,\nwhich are as readily replaceable\n/ and\n23\nand yet unquestionably form integral parts of the machines in question. And\nhere it may be noted that para. 3(b) itself speaks of\n\"incorporation in or\nattachment to\". It is true that on occasion the bladder may be removed before it\nis worn out in order to adjust\nthe machine to a different size of tyre, but this\nis apparently not the norm and I cannot see why it should make any difference.\nThe analogy of the bit and the power tool is, to my mind, not a valid one. As\none well knows, the power tool is an integral whole\nin itself. It supplies a\nsource of motor power in the form of a shaft revolving at high speed, to which\nvarious tools, such as, for\nexample, a drilling bit, may be attached to perform\ndifferent types of function. This is a far cry from the curing press, which\nperforms\nonly one function, that of shaping and vulcanizing tyres, and of which\nthe bladder is a\nvital and integral part. Without the bladder the machine,\n/ will\n24\nwill not work. The power tool will revolve quite happily without any\nattachment.\nAppellant's counsel also emphasized the relatively short life of a bladder\nand described it as \"expendable or consumable\". The former\nepithet seems to be\nmore appropriate than the latter, but, in any event, I am not sure that such a\ndescription takes the matter any\nfurther. In the course of argument the\nhypothetical case\nwas postulated of a bladder which was designed to last\nfor only one curing cycle and which then had to be re-\nplaced. In such a case there might be problems in assert- ing that the\nbladder was a part of the machine or that the replacement thereof\nconstituted\nrepair or maintenance, but those are not the facts in this case. The biadders in\nquestion are not so short-lived and,\nalthough they do for good reason wear out\nrelatively quickly, I do not think that this takes them out of the category\nof\n/ parts\n25\nparts which are incorporated in or attached to the machine for the purpose of\nrepair or maintenance.\nFor these reasons the appellant, in my view, fails on the first issue.\nAs to the second issue, I shall consider first the question as to whether the\nbladders constitute \"detach-\nable machine tools\". A \"machine tool\" is defined in\nEnglish the Oxford/Dictionary as —\n\"a machine for cutting or shaping wood,\nmetals, etc. by means of a tool, esp. one designed for use in a machine\nshop\"\nand the same dictionary defines a \"machine shop\" as —\n\"a workshop for making or repairing machines or parts of machines.\"\nWebster's Third New Tnternational Dictionary states the\nmeaning of \"machine tool\" to be —\n\"a usu. power-driven machine designed for shaping solid work by tooling\neither by removing material (as in a\n/ lathe\n26\nlathe or milling machine) or by subject-ing to deformation (as in a punch\npress)\".\nThe word \"tool\" itself is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as\nfollows:\n\"a mechanical implement for working upon something, as by cutting, striking,\nrubbing or other process in any manual art or industry;\nusually one held and\noperated directly by the hand (or fixed in a position, as in a lathe), but also\nincluding certain simple machines,\nas the lathe; sometimes extended to simple\ninstruments of other kinds\".\nAmong the illustrative examples given is a quotation\nfrom a dictionary of mechanical terms (published l877)\nreading —\n\"Of late it has become usual to embrace in the general term\nmachine\ntools\nsuch machines as the lathe, plane, slotting machine, and others\nemployed in the manufacture of machinery\".\nTurning again to Webster's Third New International Dictionary,\none finds the following relevant meanings given for the\n/ word\n27\nword \"tool\" —\n\"la: an instrument (as a hammer or saw) used or worked by hand: an instrument\nused by a handicraftsman or laborer in his work: IMPLEMENT\nb(l) the cutting or\nshaping part in a machine or machine tool (2) a machine for shaping metal:\nMACHINE TOOL\".\nAnd Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary 2nd ed. gives\nthe following relevant meanings of \"tool\"—\n\"1. any implement, instrument, or utensil held in the hand and used for\ncutting, hitting, digging, rubbing, etc: knives, saws, hammers,\nshovels, rakes,\netc. are tools.\n2. (a) any similar instrument that\nis the working part of a power-driven machine, as a drill, band-saw blade,\netc;\n(b) the whole machine; a machine tool.\"\nIt is not necessary or advisable to attempt to define the term \"detachable\nmachine tools\" with any precision. These dictionary definitions\ndo, however,\ngive a broad indication of the general characteristics\n/ of \t '\n28\nof a machine tool. Bearing in mind that Division I of Schedule 2 is concerned\ngenerally with the manufac-turing industry, it seems\nto me that broadly speaking\na machine tool in this context refers to a tool, ie. an instrument or implement\nused for working on objects\nconsisting of metal or wood or other similar\nmaterial, eg. by cutting, drilling, striking or rubbing, which is connected to a\nmachine\nwhich supplies the mechanical power required to operate the tool. The\nprecise signifi-cance in this context of the word \"detachable\"\nis not clear.\nPossibly what the Legislature had in mind was that portion of the machine tool\nconstituting the tool (as opposed to\nthe source of power), where such tool was\ndetachable from the machine itself. It is not neces-sary, however, to decide\nthis point,\nsince in my opinion the bladder in question, by its very nature,\ncannot be regarded as an implement or instrument in the nature of\na tool; nor\nwould one regard the curing press as\n/ a\n29\na machine providing mechanical power. Moreover, as was rightly stressed by\ncounsel for respondent, a tool has a certain integrity\nas a functional unit. Its\ncom-ponent parts combine to perform its intended functions. None of those parts\nwould by itself constitute\nthe tool; nor would one say that an object which by\nitself did not, and could not, perform the function was a tool. By itself the\nbladder cannot perform any function; and even when attached to the curing press\nit performs its function (which includes both heating\nthe raw tyre and helping\nto mould it) not as a mechanically driven tool, but as a component part\noperating in conjunction with other\nparts in a fairly complex machine.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, respondent's bladders do not fall under that\ncategory of nón-qualifying\ngoods defined as \"detach-able machine\ntools\".\n/ In\n30\nIn argument before the Court a\nquo\nit was conceded on behalf of the\nappellant that the bladders did not fall under the other suggested category of\nnon-qualifying goods,\nviz. \"cutting, forming, honing and moulding tools\". Before\nus appellant's counsel (who did not appear in the Court below) withdrew\nthis\nconcession and argued that the bladders constituted either forming or moulding\ntools. It may be that forming tools and moulding\ntools are terms of art in the\nmanufacturing trade and that expert evídence would have been admissible\nto establish this meaning\n(see\nCentral Press Photos Ltd v Department of\nEmployment and Productivity\n[1970] 3 All ER 775\n(CA), at pp 781-2, 783, 784;\nR v Lipschitz\n1945 CPD 278\n, at pp 279-80;\nR v Eastern Transvaal\nIndustries Ltd\n1955 (1) SA 122\n(T), at pp 124-5). No such evidence was,\n'however, led. In view of appellant's concession respon-dent can hardly be\nblamed for this.\nAt all events,\n/ for\n31\nfor the reasons already elaborated I do not think that the bladders in\nquestion can be regarded as falling within the ordinary meaning\nof the word\n\"tool\" and, therefore, a\nfortiori\n, they cannot fall under the\ndescriptions \"forming tools\" and \"moulding tools\". Moreover, it seems most\nunlikely that expert evidence\nfrom the trade would lead one to any different a\nconclusion.\nConsequently the appellant fails on the second\nissue as well.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.\nM M CORBETT\nHOEXTER JA)\nBOTHA JA) CONCUR\nGROSSKOPF JA)\nNICHOLAS AJA)",

    "facts": "Dunlop South Africa Ltd, a manufacturer and wholesale seller of pneumatic tyres, imported rubber bladders used in its tyre‑curing presses. The bladders were purchased separately from the machines and replaced periodically as part of the machines’ maintenance. The Commissioner for Inland Revenue issued a sales‑tax assessment on these imports for the period 3 July 1978 to 4 May 1982, asserting that the bladders were taxable goods. Dunlop appealed, arguing that the bladders were exempt under Schedule 2 of the Sales Tax Act because they were parts used for repair or maintenance of the machines, or because they fell within the non‑qualifying‑goods categories such as detachable machine tools or moulding tools.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the imported bladders constitute \"parts purchased for incorporation in or attachment to\" curing machines for the purpose of repair or maintenance by the vendor, thus qualifying for exemption under sec. 6(1)(c) and sec. 3(b) of Schedule 2. 2. If exempt under the first ground, whether the bladders are classified as \"detachable machine tools\" or \"cutting, forming, honing or moulding tools\" – categories listed as non‑qualifying goods – which would remove the exemption for the period after 18 July 1979.",
    "principles": "The court applied the statutory framework of the Sales Tax Act, focusing on sec. 6(1) exemptions and the definitions in Schedule 2. It examined amendments to para 3(a) and (b), the inclusion of “non‑qualifying goods,” and the legislative intent behind the exemption for parts used in repair or maintenance. The court also considered the ordinary meanings of “machine tool” and “tool” from authoritative dictionaries and case law on repair and maintenance.",
    "application": "The court found that the bladders are integral parts of the curing presses, essential for their operation, and are replaced as part of routine repair and maintenance. Accordingly, they fall within para 3(b) as parts purchased for incorporation or attachment for repair/maintenance, satisfying the exemption criteria for the period 3 July 1978‑17 July 1979. Regarding the second issue, the court determined that the bladders are not “detachable machine tools” nor “cutting, forming, honing or moulding tools” because they do not perform a cutting or shaping function and are not instruments in the ordinary sense of a tool. Hence they are not non‑qualifying goods, preserving the exemption for the later period as well.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The bladders were held to be exempt parts used for repair and maintenance, and they do not fall within the non‑qualifying‑goods categories. Dunlop South Africa Ltd is not liable for the assessed sales tax, and the Commissioner’s assessment is set aside. Costs were awarded to the respondent."
