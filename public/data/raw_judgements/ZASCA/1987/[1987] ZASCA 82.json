Appellant was accused no 1 at the trial.\nThe....../ 2\n2\nThe allegations against the five accused were that on the 18th December 1984\nat Leeukop prison they murdered one Johannes Modis (the\ndeceased). Appellant and\nhis four co-accused as well as the deceased were at the time inmates of cell 4\nsection C at the aforesaid\nprison, the deceased having been admitted to that\ncell at approximately 16h00 on the 18th. Some hours later he was dead.\nPro\ndeo\ncounsel was appointed for appellant but he refused to avail himself of\nsuch counsel's services and the tria Judge eventually ruled\nthat appellant\nshould conduct his own def Appellant and his co-accused all pleaded not guilty.\nAppellant was convicted of murder\nwith\ndolus directus\nand, with one of\nthe assessors dissenting, no extenuating circumstances were found.\nAppellant\nwas sentenced to death but the trial Judge granted\nhim .... / 3\n3\nhim leave to appeal to this Court against the majority finding\nthat there\nwere no extenuating circumstances and the death\nsentence which followed upon that finding. I may add that\naccused no 2 was\nfound guilty of murder without extenuating cir-\ncumstances and was also\nsentenced to death. An application\nby him for leave to appeal against his\nconviction and sentence\nwas refused. As far as accused no 3 was concerned the\ntrial\nCourt found that he took part in the assault which led to\nthe\ndeceased's death but that he acted under compulsion from appel-\nlant and he, no 3, was acquitted. Accused nos 4 and 5 were\nboth convicted\nof assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm\nThe medical evidence, which was not challenged\nbefore this Court, showed\nthat the deceased died of multiple\ninjuries to his head which caused brain damage, and also\nmultiple .... / 4\n4\nmultiple injuries to his face, neck and upper parts of his chest.\nAs far\nas the neck injuries were concerned the doctor stated thc\nthere were clear\nindications of strangulation by means of a\nligature such as a belt. These neck injuries were definitely\nante-mortem\nand although the brain-and certain of the other\ninjuries by themselves would\nin all probability have caused deat\nthe strangulation was probably the final\nact in the killing\nprocess. As it was put by the doctor, the other\ninjuries\nwould not have caused immediate death but\n\"this (i e strangulation) would have been the last thing to do to give the\nfinal blow, or rather pull, to kill the person.\"\nIn summary the following were the facts surround-\ning the killing of the deceased.\nOn the 18th December 1984 the deceased, who was\nan .... / 5\n5\nan inmate of cell 2 section C of the Leeukop prison, asked to\nbe\ntransferred to another cell because he, the deceased, stated\nthat he had\nreason to believe that his life was in danger if he\nremained in cell 2. As a\nresult the deceased was transferred\nto cell 4 and, as stated earlier, he was\nadmitted to that cell\nat approximately 16h00. It appears that appellant and\nat least\nsome of the other accused were at some stage or another\nalso\ndetained in cell 2 and that appellant knew the deceased before\nhe was\nadmitted to cell 4. Whether there was friction be-\ntween appellant and\ndeceased during the period they were both\nin cell 2 one does not know. Be\nthat as it may, the evidence\nis clear that trouble started between the two\nvery soon after\nthe deceased entered cell 4. In his evidence, and this\npart\nof it was apparently accepted by the trial Court, appellant\nstated .... / 6\n6\nstated that when the deceased was admitted to cell 4 by the\nprison warders he, the deceased:\n\"swore at me, he asked me why I was looking at him. I said to him 'why can't\nyou be looked at?' He then swore at me again, he swore\nme by my mother.\"\nAppellant went on to say that he then asked to\nsee the man in charge of\nthe section and told him that the de-\nceased had sworn at him but this man\ntold him to return to\nthe cell which, according to appellant, he did. There\nis no\nsuggestion that appellant or anyone else attacked the deceased\nat\nthat stage or even shortly thereafter. Appellant stated\nthat after the\ndeceased had sworn at him and he had complained\nto the warder he went and sat\ndown and \"thought of the swear-\ning words\".\nNow I may just pause here to say that it appears\nfrom .... / 7\n7\nfrom the evidence that in the Leeukop prison, as in many South\nAfrican prisons, many inmates belong to one or other gang.\nIn cell 4 which is here under discussion there were,\ninter alia\nthe\n\"Air Force 3\" gang, to which appellant and accused nos\n3, 4 and 5 belonged, the \"Big 5\" of which accused no 2 was a\nmember and\nthe \"28\" gang to which the deceased apparently be-\nlonged. The evidence which the trial Court accepted was that\nappellant\nheld the rank of \"colonel\" in the \"Air Force 3\"\ngang and accused no 2 that of\n\"chief inspector\" in the \"Big 5\"\ngang.\nThe trial Court found that at about 19h00 the\ndeceased was attacked by\nappellant and the four other accused.\nThe Court found, and appellant really\nadmitted this, that\nappellant started the attack. Now two State witnesses,\nHarry\nRabie .... / 8\n8\nRabie and Max Moyo, who were at the time also detained in cell\n4, stated\nthat before the deceased was attacked the five accused\nheld a \"skumba\" or\nmeeting where they sat in a circle and had\na discussion. After the discussion\nappellant called the de-\nceased and as the deceased reached him the appellant\nattacked\nthe deceased by grabbing him by the throat and the other\nfour\naccused immediately joined in the attack. The trial Court\nfound it\nunnecessary to decide whether a \"skumba\" was in fact\nheld where the attack on\ndeceased was formally discussed and\nagreed upon but it found that before the\ndeceased was called\nand attacked by the appellant and the other four,\nappellant\nhad discussions with certain of his co-accused, and the\nway in\nwhich the other accused immediately joined in the\nattack strongly pointed to\nappellant having beforehand\ncanvassed .... / 9\n9\ncanvassed for their support. The evidence showed that during\nthe attack the deceased fell on the floor where he was kicked,\ntrampled on and jumped upon by the appellant and his co-\naccused who all\nhad their prison boots on. After a while the\ndeceased was lying still. The\ndeceased was put on a sleeping\nmat and the witness Max Moyo was ordered to\ncover him with a\nblanket which Moyo did. In his evidence appellant\nadmitted\nthat at that stage the deceased was unconscious. After a\nwhile\nthe deceased made a sound which the witness Rabie de-\nscribed as a \"roggel\".\nAppellant went to where the deceased\nwas lying, lifted the blanket and called\naccused no 3 and\nordered him to trample the deceased on his head and neck\nwhich\nno 3 did after which the deceased again became quiet. The\ntrial Court referred to the happenings which I have just\ndescribed .... / 10\n10\ndescribed as \"phase one\" of the assault on the deceased. After\na while there was again this \"geroggel\" from the deceased.\nAppellant asked\nthe witness Moyo for his belt which appellant\nput round the deceased's neck.\nAppellant then called accused\nno 2 and with the belt round the deceased's\nneck and through\nthe buckle they both pulled at the end of the belt. One\nof\nthem had his foot on the deceased's neck. The deceased became\nquiet\nagain and appellant left him. The trial Court described\nthis putting of the\nbelt round the deceased's neck and pulling\nit tight by appellant and accused\nno 2 as \"phase two\".\nAfter appellant had left the deceased and had gone back\nto his\nsleeping place, accused no 2 fetched his blankets and spread\nthem\nnext to the deceased and lay down beside the deceased.\nThe witness Moyo lay\ndown next to accused no 2 and according\nto..... / 11\n11\nto him, accused no 2 put his hand under the deceased's blankets\nand kept\npulling at the belt which was still round the de-\nceased's neck. The trial Court referred to this as \"phase\nthree\". In the middle of the night accused no 2 removed the\nbelt from the\ndeceased's neck and gave it to accused no 5 who\nflushed it down the toilet. When the prison warders entered\nthe cell the\nnext morning they found the deceased's dead body\non the mat near the door\nwhere he was put by Moyo after the\nattack by the five accused and where he\nwas later strangled\nwith the belt by appellant and accused no 2. Warrant\nOfficer\nMkhatshwa, who was in charge of section C of the Leeukop prison\nand who went to cell 4 after deceased's body had been dis-\ncovered,testified that when he asked that those who had taken\npart in the killing of the deceased should come forward,\nthe...../ 12\n12\nthe five accused stepped to one side. He asked them why they\nhad killed\nthe deceased and appellant replied:\n\"Father Mkhatshwa, we have killed the dog.\"\nAppellant further said that\nmembers of the \"28\" gang. to which\ndeceased belonged \"looked down upon us\",\npresumably referring\nto members of the other gangs. He made no mention of\nany\nswearing by the deceased.\nAfter appellant's conviction he elected to again\ngive evidence but the\nonly relevant point he raised in ex-\ntenuation was that the deceased had\nsworn at him by his mother's\nprivate parts. He persisted in his denial in his\nevidence on\nthe merits that he took part in \"phase two\" of the assault\ni e the strangling of the deceased with the belt or that he\nknew anything\nabout it.\nIn...... / 13\n13\nIn the trial Court's judgment on the presence or absence of extenuating\ncircumstances Vermooten AJ stated that the Court accepted\nthat appellant was\nsworn at as stated by\nhim. The Court found that this was a fact or\ncircumstance\nwhich at the time of the commission of the offence, could\nhave\ninfluenced and probably did influence the appellant's state of\nmind.\nThe trial Judge and one of the assessors however found\nthat this influence\nwas not of such a nature as to reduce the\nmoral blameworthiness of the\nappellant in doing what he did\nand the majority of the members of the Court\ntherefore found\nthat there were no extenuating circumstances. In\nthis\nconnection Vermooten AJ\ninter alia\nreferred to the fact that\na\nfairly long time elapsed between the alleged swearing and the\nbeginning of\nthe attack on the deceased and also the fact\nthat...... / 14\n14\nthat it was not one continuous attack but that it\nwas carried out in phases with intervals in between. He also made men-tion of\nthe\nfact that the appellant persuaded the others to join him in the attack on\nthe deceased.\nThe principle is of course well settled that the question as to\nthe existence or otherwise of extenuating circumstances is essentially\none for\ndecision by the trial Court, and that, in the absence of misdirection or\nirregula-rity, the Court will not interfere with\na finding that no extenuating\ncircumstances were present, unless it is one to which the trial Court could not\nreasonably have come.\nMr\nOosthuysen\n, who appeared on behalf of the\nappellant before this Court, could point to no misdirection or irregularity on\nthe part of the trial\nCourt nor could he\npersuade .... / 15\n15\npersuade me that the majority finding of that Court was wrong.\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed.\nH R JACOBS, JA\nJOUBERT, JA )\nconcur\nSMALBERGER, JA )",

    "facts": "In December 1984, at Leeukop prison, inmate Johannes Modis was transferred to cell 4 where he encountered appellant Willy Jacob Mpipi and four co‑accused who belonged to rival prison gangs. After an alleged verbal altercation, the five accused attacked Modis in a series of staged phases: initial beating, strangulation with a belt, and further harassment. Medical evidence showed multiple head injuries and ante‑mortem strangulation. The trial court convicted Mpipi of murder with dolus directus and sentenced him to death, finding no extenuating circumstances.",
    "issues": "The primary issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in finding that no extenuating circumstances existed, particularly whether the verbal provocation alleged by the appellant could have mitigated his moral blameworthiness. A subsidiary issue concerned whether any misdirection or irregularity occurred in the trial court’s assessment of the murder and the death sentence.",
    "principles": "South African law holds that the existence of extenuating circumstances is a matter of fact for the trial court, subject to review only for misdirection or irregularity. The influence of provocation must be of a nature sufficient to reduce moral blameworthiness. The appellate court may not substitute its own view for that of the trial court absent clear error.",
    "application": "The appellate court examined the trial record and found no misdirection. It noted the long interval between the alleged swearing and the attack, the multi‑phased nature of the assault, and the appellant’s role in organising the attack. These facts indicated that any provocation did not substantially affect the appellant’s state of mind, and therefore no extenuating circumstances existed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The conviction for murder and the death sentence imposed on Willy Jacob Mpipi were upheld, with the court confirming that the trial court correctly found no extenuating circumstances."
