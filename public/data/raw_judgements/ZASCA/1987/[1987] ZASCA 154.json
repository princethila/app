With leave of the Court\na quo\nthe\nappellant now\nappeals to this Court against its judgment\nand order.\n/The\n3\nThe facts material to the appeal are undisputed. They are\nbriefly as follows. In 1938 the appellant, who is Xhosa speaking, was born\nin\nSprings, Transvaal. He was at all relevant times until December 1981 a citizen\nof the Republic of South Africa by birth. He returned\nwith his parents to\nNkqonkqweni, a portion of Peelton location near East London, where he was\npermanently resident and domiciled\nsince 1979. Nkqonkqweni, is situated in the\nRepublic of South Africa and outside the Republic of Ciskei when the latter came\ninto\nexis= tence on 4 December 1981 by virtue of the provisions of the Status of\nCiskei Act No 110 of 1981 (the\"Act\").\n/In\n4.\nIn terms of sec 6(1) of the Act, read with Schedule B\nthereto, the appellant on 4 December 1981 became a\ncitizen of the Republic of Ciskei and ceased to be a\ncitizen of the\nRepublic of South Africa.\nOn 22 December 1981 the then Minister of Internal\nAffairs issued two\nnotices both with retrospective effect\nas from 4 December 1981. The one\nnotice was issued under\nsec 7 bis (1) of the Aliens Act No 1 of 1937,\nexempting\ncitizens of the Republic of Ciskei as a class of persons\nfrom\nthe requirement of being in possession of temporary\nresidence permits subject\nto his right to revoke such ex=\nemption in terms of sec 7 bis (3) of Act No 1\nof 1937 in\nrespect of a class of persons or a single person. The other\nnotice issued under sec 40 (2)(a) of the Admission of Persons to the Republic\nRegulation Act No 59 of 1972 exempted citizens\n/of\n5.\nof the Republic of Ciskei as a category of persons\nfrom visa requirements as laid down in sec 40(1 )(c) of Act No 59 of 1972\nsubject\nto his right of revoking such exemptions in terms of sec 40(2) (c)(i) of\nthe said Act in respect of a category of persons or a single\nperson.\nOn 8 November 1984 the appellant received a\nletter from the Director-General, Department of Home Affairs,\nwhich\ncontained the following notifications:\n\"I have to inform you that your exemption from the visa requirements as laid\ndown in Section 40(1)(c) of the Admission of Persons\nto the Republic Regulation\nAct, 1972 (Act 59 of 1972) has been withdrawn. This means that before you can\nagain enter the Republic\nof South Africa you will have to be in possession of a\nvisa. Application for such a visa may be made to the nearest South African\nDiplomatic or Consular Representative abroad or to the Director-General for Home\nAffairs, Pretoria.\n/Should\n6\nShould you in future arrive at a South African port of entry\nwithout a visa you will not be permitted to enter.\nPurthermore your exemption from the reguire= ments to be in possession of a\ntemporary residence permit in terms of section 2(b) of\nthe Aliens Act, 1937 (Act\n1 of 1937) has also been withdrawn.\"\nThe purported effect of these notifications was that the\nappellant would\nfrom then onwards require a temporary re=\nsidence permit to reside at\nNkqonkqweni or elsewhere in\nthe Republic of South Africa. If he moved across\nthe\nborders of the Republic of South Africa he would require\na visa to\nenter it.\nAs a matter of urgency the appellant\napplied in the Court\na quo\nagainst the respondent for\nthe relief set out\nsupra\n.\n/Relying\n7\nRelying on the provisions of sec 6(3) of the Act\nthe\nappellant maintained that his existing right of residence\nwithout a\npermit in the Republic of South Africa and his\nexisting right to move to and\nfrom the Rêpublic of South\nAfrica without a visa were preserved with\nthe coming into\noperation of the Act on 4 December 1981 when he was\nde=\nprived of his South African citizenship. He also main=\ntained that he\ncould not be deprived of his preserved\nexisting rights by administrative\naction as the Director-\nGeneral purported to do by his notifications on 8\nNovember\n1984.\nSec 6(3) of the Act provides as follows :\n/\"No\n8\n\"No citizen of the Ciskei resident in the Republic at the\ncommencement of this Act-shall, except as regards citizenship, forfeit any\nexisting rights, privileges or benefits\nby reason only of the other pro=\nvisions of this Act\n.\"\n(My italics).\nRead in the context of the Act as a whole the words \"the\nother provisions\nof this Act\" in sec 6(3) undoubtedly refer\nto the provisions of sec 6(1)\nwhich reads as follows:\n\"Every person falling in any of the categories of persons defined in Scedule\nB shall be a citizen of Ciskei and shall cease to be\na South African\ncitizen.\"\nThe effect of sec 6(1) was that on 4 December\n1981 South African citizens,\nwho fell within the categories\nof persons defined in Schedule B to the Act,\nby operation\n/of\n9\nof law ceased to be South African citizens, in lieu\nof which\nthey became citizens of Ciskei. Loss of South\nAfrican citizenship resulted in\nthe acquisition of the\nstatus of an alien or foreigner (\nperegrinus\n) by becoming\na citizen\n(\ncivis\n) of Ciskei. Moreover, in terms of\nsec 1(1) of the Act Ciskei\nwas declared a sovereign in=\ndependent state which ceased to be\nconstitutionally and\ngeographically part of the Republic of South\nAfrica.\nThe latter ceased to exercise any authority over Ciskei\n(sec 1(2)). Sec 3(1) empowered\ninter alia\nthe Legis=\nlative\nAssembly of Ciskei to enact laws (including a\nconstitution) for Ciskei in the\nmanner prescribed by the\nNational States Constitution Act No 21 of 1971.\nThe\n/RBpublic\n10 Republic of Ciskei Constitution Act No 20 of 1981, duly\nenacted by the Legislative Assembly of Ciskei and signed by the chairman\nof that\nbody in accordance with the provisions of the Republic of Ciskei Constitution\nAct No 20 of 1981, was published on 4 December\n1981 in a Government Gazette of\nCiskei and came into operation on the same day. Sec 67 (1) of the Republic of\nCiskei Constitution\nAct No 20 of 1981 provided for the acquisition of Ciskeian\ncitizen= ship. The constitutional evolution of Ciskei in consti= tutional\nlaw as\na sovereign and independent state with its own state territory was thus finally\ncompleted on 4 December 1981. The recognition\nof Ciskei in international law as\na sovereign and independent state is an entirely different matter which does not\nconcern us in\nthe present\n/appeal\n11\nappeal. Until now the sovereign independence of Ciskei has not been recognized\nby members of the world community of states.\nTo understand the\nprovisions of the Act it is necessary to have regard to the important\npre-independence legislation which directed\nthe various stages of Ciskei's\nconstitutional evolution in its tránsition to sovereignty and\nindependence. For present purposes\nthe relevant pre-independence statutes and\nproclamations are broadly speaking the following : (i) The Glen Gray Act No 25\nof 1894\n(C) provided for the\ncreation of locations and the control of them by location\n/boards ...\n12\nboards as well as the establishment of district councils\nfor the administration of local affairs in the district\nof Glen Gray (i.e. a portion of the Ciskeian territory).\nThis system of local government was also introduced by\nproclamation in an adapted form in the Transkeian terri=\ntories.\n(ii) The Black Authorities Act (original title : Bantu\nAuthori=\nties Act) No 68 of 1951 abplished the Native Representa=\ntive Council and amended the Representation of Natives\nAct No 12 of 1936. It provided a framework for the\nestablishment of Black tribal, community and territorial\nauthorities in respect of Black tribes or communities in\nBlack areas. See M.P. Olivier's unpublished doctoral\n/thesis\n13\nthesis, 'n\nJuridiese Evaluering van\nSoewereiniteits=\nvestiging en die Oordrag van Owerheidsgesag met\nbesondere\nverwysing na die Suid-Afrikaanse Situasie\n(June\n1986,\nUniversity of South Africa), at p 303-304 :\n\"Die\nWet op Swart Owerhede\n68 van 1951 het die instelling van 'n\nhiërargiese struktuur van stam- of gemeenskapsowerhede, streeks= owerhede\nen gebiedsowerhede\nvoorsien in gebiede waarvan die territoriale basis reeds deur\nvroeëre wetgewing verskaf is. Hierdeur is erkenning verleen aan\ndie\nstamkonsep en tradisionele gesagstrukture onder die swartes, asook aan swart\nbeheer oor swart gebiede. So byvoorbeeld het bestaande\nstam-of\ngemeenskapsregerings die basis van die statutêre stam- of\ngemeenskapsowerhede gevorm en moes sodanige owerhede hulle\nfunksies oor=\neenkomstig inheemse reg uitoefen. Waar die stam- of gemeenskapsowerhede oor\nadvies- en bestuursfunksies beskik het,\nis die streeks-\n/en\n14\nen gebiedsowerhede met adviesbevoegdhede asook met wetgewende en uitvoerende\nbevoegdhede ten opsigte van plaaslike aangeleenthede\nbeklee.\"\nBy\nGovernment Notice R496 of 1961 the Ciskeian Territorial Authority was\nestablished in respect of certain areas for which Black Riegional\nAuthorities\nhad been created. The Paramount Chief of the Rarabe section of the Xhosa tribal\ncomplex was designated as chairman of\nthe Ciskeian Territo= rial Authority.\n(iii) The Promotion of Black Self-Government Act (original title: Promotion of\nBantu Self-Government\nAct) No 46 of 1959 divided the Black peoples of South\nAfrica into certain separate national units on the basis of language and\n/culture\n15\nculture (sec 2). Its object was to provide for the\ngradual\ndevelopment of Black national units within their\nown areas to self-governing\nunits on the basis of Black\nsystems of government. See Olivier,\nop.cit\n., p 306-307:\n\"Gevolglik is die\nWet op die Bevordering van Swart Selfbestuur\nin 1959\naangeneem. Aan= gesien daar ingesien is dat swartes nie slegs in stamverband\nnie, maar ook in breër volks= verband georganiseer\nis, is daartoe oorge=\ngaan om die swart bevolking in 'n aantal volks= eenhede in te deel. - - - -\nHierdeur is 'n etniese grondslag\nvir die (latere) skepping van onafhanklike\nswart state gelê. Die betrokke wet het ook die instelling van die amp van\nkommissaris-generaal\nvir elke volks= eenheid gereël, waardeur\nverteenwoordiging van die Suid-Afrikaanse regering by die volks= eenhede\nteweeggebring\nis. Voorts is die bevoegdhede en funksies van h gebiedsowerheid\ningevolge die\nWet op Swart Owerhede\ndeur\ndie\n16\ndie 1959-wet heromskrywe en uitgebrei, en is die oordrag van trustgrond en\nbevoegdhede daaromtrent aan 'n gebiedsowerheid voorsien.\"\n(iv)\nThe National States Citizenship Act (formerly the Bantu Homelands Citizenship\nAct) No 26 of 1970 introduced a rather strange\nconcept of so-called citizenship\nin respect of every Black territorial authority area. It provided that every\nBlack person in South\nAfrica not a so-calléd citizen of a Black\nself-governing territory in South Africa (which included the Transkei) and not a\nprohibited immi= grant became a so-called citizen of the Black terrotorial\nauthority area in which he was born, or domiciled, or\nspoke a Black language\nused in such area, or was related\n/to ....\n17\nto any member of the Black population of such area.\nSuch a Black person retained his South African citizenship\nbut had to\nexercise his franchise rights in such area.\nPrior to its amendment in 1986\nsec 2 of Act 26 of 1970,\nas originally enacted, provided as follows:\n\"(1) There shall be citizenship of every territorial authority area.\n(2)\tEvery Bantu person in the Republic. shall, if he is not a citizen of any\nself- governing Bantu territory in the Republic and\nis not a prohibited\nimmigrant in the Republic, be a citizen of one or other territorial authority\narea, in accordance with the provisions\nof section 3.\n(3)\tEvery person who is by virtue of the provisions of section 3 a citizen of a\nterritorial authority area shall,\n/subject ...\n18\nsubject to the provisions of this Act, exercise such franchise rights in that\narea and enjoy all other rights, privi= leges and benefits\nand be subject to all\nthe duties, obligations and responsibili= ties of citizenship of that\nterritorial authority area as areaccorded\nto or imposed upon him in terms of any\nlaw.\n(4)\nA citizen\nof a territorial authority area shall not be regarded as an alien in the\nRepublic and shall, by virtue of his citizenship\nof a territory forming part of\nthe Republic, remain for all purposes a citizen of the Republic and shall be\naccorded full protection\naccording to international law by the\nRepublic.\n(5)\nNo person who is a citizen of a\nterritorial authority area shall by reason only of the provisions of this Act be\nrelieved of any\nduties, obligations or\nresponsibilities or forfeit any existing rights, privileges or benefits which\nbut for the said provi= sions\nwould have been applicable in his case.\"\n/See\n19\nSee Olivier\nop.cit\n., p 314-315. It should be borne in\nmind that, unlike Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and Venda, the Transkei progressed\ndirectly from Black\nterritorial authority status to self- government according\nto the provisions of the Transkei Constitution Act No 48 of 1963 without\nhaving\nacquired the intermediate status of responsible government. Chapter III of the\nTranskei Constitution Act No 48 of 1963 which\ndeals with citizen= ship is in\ncondensed form unmistakably the precursor of Act 26 of 1970. The relevant\nprovisions of sec 7 of the\nTranskei Constitution Act No 48 of 1963 provide as\nfollows :\n/\" (1) There\n20\n\"(1) There shall be a Transkeian citizenship and every person who is a\ncitizen of the Transkei by virtue of the pro= visions of sub-section\n(2) shall,\nsubiect to the orovisions of this Act, exercise franchise rights in the Transkei\nand enjoy all other rights, privileges\nand benefits and be subject to all the\nduties, obligations and responsibili= ties of citizenship in the Transkei as are\naccorded\nto or imposed upon him in terms of this Act.\n(2)-----\n(3) The Republic shall not regard a citizen of the Transkei as an alien in\nthe Republic and shall by virtue of his citizenship of\na territory forming part\nof the Republic of South Africa regard him for all external purposes in terms of\ninternational law as a\ncitizen of the Republic and afford him full pro= tection\naccording to international law.\n/ (4) No\n21\n(4) No person who is a citizen of the\nTranskei shall by reason only of the provisions of this section be relieved\nof any duties, obligations or respon= sibilities or forfeit\nany existing rights,\nprivileges or benefits which but for the said provisions would have been\napplicable in his case.\"\nThis concept of so-called Transkeian citizenship in\n1963, before the Status of the Transkei Act No 100\nof 1976\ndeclared the Transkei a sovereign and inde=\npendent state, was really the precursor of the so-\ncalled citizenship referred to in Act 26 of 1970.\n(v) The National States Constitution Act (formerly the Bantu Homelands\nConstitution Act) No 21 of 1971 provided the framework within\nwhich the State\nPresident could, after\n/consultation\n22\nconsultation by the Minister of Plural Relations and\nDevelopment (subsequently the Minister of Bantu Adminis=\nstration and Development) with a territorial authority,\nby proclamation in\nthe Gazette transform a territorial\nauthority into a legislative assembly for\nthe Black\narea for which such territorial authority had been es=\ntablished\n(sec 1(1)). Provision was also made for the\nestablishment of an executive\ncouncil (sec 5). For the\nsake of convenience the status of the\ntransformed\nsystem of government may be called responsible govern=\nment.\nChapter 2 contains the provisions applicable\nto the transformation of a\nresponsible government into\n/a\n23\na self- government of a self- governing territory (secs 26 to\n36 A inclusive). Self- government of a Black area would constitute the\nlast pre-\nindependence stage of constitutional development before the attain= ment of\nsovereignty and independence by such Black\narea. By Proclamation R118 of 1971\nthe State President, acting in terms of secs 1, 2 and 5 of Act 21 of 1971,\nestablished with effect\nfrom 1 June 1971 a legislative assembly, to be known as\nthe Ciskeian Legislative Assembly, for the area described in the Schedule\nto the\nProclamation. The Ciskei thus acquired the status of responsible government.\nSubsequently by the Ciskei Constitution\n/Proclamation ....\n24\nProclamation R187 of 1972 the State President, acting\nin\nterms of secs 2, 5 and 26 of Act 21 of 1971 and\nsec 108 of the Republic of\nSouth Africa Constitution\nAct No 32 of 1961 after consultation of the\nCiskeian\nLegislative Assembly by the Minister of Bantu Administra=\ntion\nand Development, declared Ciskei to be a self-\ngoverning territory within the\nRepublic of South Africa\nwith effect from 1 August 1972 (sec 2(1)).\nCiskei\nas a self-governing territory had reached the last\npre-independence\nstage of its constitutional evolution.\nOnly so-called citizens of Ciskei\nregistered as voters\nwere entitled to vote at any election of members to\nthe Ciskeian Legislative Assembly (sec 6(2) read\n/with\n25\nwith the definition of \"citizen\" in sec 1).\nIt is appropriate to have regard to certain events which immediately preceded\nthe independence of Ciskei. A referendum was held to\nascertain the attitude of\nso-called citizens of Ciskei towards the vexed question of the independence of\nCiskei. See Olivier,\nop.cit\n., p 403 footnote 184. It was the government\nof Ciskei that expressed the desire that Ciskei should become an independent\nstate as\nappears from the preamble to the Act. Moreover, the govern= ment of\nSouth Africa and the government of Ciskei entered into a large\nnumber of\nagreements concerning\nrelationships between South Africa and Ciskei as\n/from\n26\nfrom the date on which the latter became independent\nfor an initial period of 5 years from that date. Worthy\nof mention is the\n\"Agreement between the Government of\nthe Republic of South Africa and the\nGovernment of Ciskei\nrelating to the movement of citizens of the Republic\nof\nSouth Africa and of Ciskei across the common borders\"\npublished in\nGazette No 8204 on 14 May 1982. Article\n1 of this Agreement provides as\nfollows:\n\"The movement to and the sojourn in the Republic of South Africa of citizens\nof Ciskei and the movement to and the sojourn in Ciskei\nof citizens of the\nRepublic of South Africa shall, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, be\ngoverned by the laws and regulations\nregulating the admission to,\n/residence ....\n27\nresidence in and the departure from the country in\nquestion.\"\nThis Agreement is an executive act which is binding\nbetween the\ngovernments of South Africa and Ciskei but\ninasmuch as it was not adopted or\nratified by a legis=\nlative act of our legislature it does not form\npart\nof our municipal law. See\nPan American World\nAirways\nIncorporated v S A Fire and Accident Insurance Co\nLtd\n,\n1965(3) SA 150 (AD) at p 161 B-D.\nTo revert to the provisions of sec 6(1) and\n(3) of the Act. I have indicated\nsupra\nthat on loss\nof their South\nAfrican citizenship Ciskeian citizens\nbecame foreigners (\nperegrini\n) in\nthe Republic óf South\n/Africa\n28\nAfrica. On reading sec 6(1) in conjunction with sec\n6(3) it is clear that the word \"citizenship\" in sec 6(3)\nrefers to South\nAfrican citizenship. The latter\nconcept as used in sec 6(3) is not defined in\nthe Act.\n\"Citizenship may be distinguished from nationality:\nwhereas citizenship\nidentifies a person internally, i.e.\nas against foreign states, as being part\nof the struc=\nture of a state, nationality identifies a person\ninter=\nnationally, i.e. as against foreign states, as being\nunder the\nprotection of his particular state.\"(T\nhe Con\n=\nstitutions of Transkei\n,\nBophuthstswana\n,\nVenda and\nCiskei\n,\n1985, edited by M P Vorster, M Wiechers and D J VanVuuren\nat p.11). In my judgment it is clear from the provisions\n/of\n29\nof the Act as a whole that the legislature intended South\nAfrican citizenship to encompass the legal status of a person internally\nas a\nsubject of the Reipublic of South Africa. To suggest that Ciskeians by the loss\nof their South African citizenship merely lost\nthe \"higher category of political\nrights\", viz the rights of franchise, is wholly untenable in the light of\nCiskei's constitutional\nevolution in its transition to sovereignty and\nindependence. I already indicated\nsupra\nthat when Ciskei acquired the\nstatus of responsible government the Ciskeians in consequence of their so-called\ncitizenship of Ciskei\nhad franchise\n/rights\n30\nrights to elect members of the CCiskeian Legislative Assembly.\nAt that stage they had no franchise rights as citizens of the Rëpublic\nof\nSouth Africa to elect members of the South African House of Assembly.\nOn the\nproper construction of sec 6(3) it consists of two provisions which I shall for\nconvenience call the \"exception phrase\" and\nthe \"recording clause\". The\nexception phrase refers to South African citizenship viz. \"except as regards\ncitizenship\" whereas the\n\"recording clause\" refers to the dominant provision of\nsec 6(3) viz : \"No citizen of Ciskei resident in the Republic at the\ncommencement\nof this Act shall - - - - -\n/forfeit\n31\nforfeit any existing rights, privileges or benefits by\nrea\nson only of the other provisions of this Act\n.\" (My italics). In my\njudgment the Legislature had\nno intention to preserve or entrench any\nexisting rights,\ndependent on South African citizenship privileges or benefits dependent on\nSouth African citizenship of Ciskeians resident in the\nRepublic of South Africa on 4 December 1981, that is\nto say, it had no\nintention to raise them to the status\nof privileged aliens. Had that been the\nLegislature's\nintention it could very easily have enacted that they\nwere\nnot to be regarded as aliens in the Republic of\nSouth Africa. Compare sec\n7(3) of the Transkei Con=\nstitution Act No 48 of 1963. By means of the\nrecording\n/clause\n32\nclause the Legislature intended to affirm that Ciskeian\ncitizens who were resident in the Republic of South Africa\non 4 December\n1981 would not forfeit any existing rights,\nprivileges or benefits by virtue\nof the other provisions\nof the Act (\"by reason only of the other\nprovisions\nof this Act\") - the only qualification being the ex=\nception\nphrase relating to South African citizenship.\nThe reference to \"resident in\nthe Republic\" in sec\n6(3) was necessitated by reason of the fact that\nas\non 4 December 1981 the South African Legislature\ncould not - even for\nrecording purposes - legislate\nextraterritorially for Ciskeians not resident\nin the\nRepublic of South Africa.\n/I\n32 (a)\nI have already pointed out that it was common cause that the appellant was on\n4 December 1981 domiciled and permanently resident in\nNkqonkqweni, i.e. in the\nRepublic of South Africa. The acquisition or continuance of domicile or\npermanent residence in South Africa\nis according to our common law not dependent\non South African citizenship. Our common law clearly distinguishes between\ndomiciled\nor permanent resident foreigners and non-domiciled or non-permament\nresident \" foreigners. See\nMagida v Minister of Police\n, 1987(1) SA 1(A)\nat p8 J-9A, I-J. I shall hereinafter investi= gate the position whether the\nappellant on the loss of\n/his\n33\nhis South African citizenship lost or retained his right to be\ndomiciled and permanently resident in the Republic of South Africa.\nThat\nnecessitates a care= ful scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the Aliens Act\nNo 1 of 1937.\nI now turn to consider the relevant pro= visions of the Aliens Act No 1 of\n1937. Sec 2\nthereof which places a restriction on alien immigration reads as\nfollows:\n\"Subject to the provisions of section 7\nbis\nand 12 no alien shall -\n(a) enter or be in the Union for purposes of permanent residence therein, unless\nhe is in possession of a permit to enter the\n/Union\n34\nUnion for the said purpose, issued to him in terms of section 4;\nor\n(b) enter or be in the Union or any parti=\ncular portion of the Union for the purpose of temporary sojourn therein, unless\nhe is in possession of a temporary permit issued\nto him in terms of section 5(1)\nor unless he has been permitted to enter under section 7.\"\nAn\nalien is defined by sec 1 as \"a person who is not a\nSouth African citizen\".\nThat is to say, a\nperegrinus\n.\nSec 7\nbis\n(1) empowers the\nMinister in his discretion to\ngrant exemptions from the provisions of sec 2\nwhile sec 7\nbis\n(3) empowers him in his discretion to withdraw\nany\nexemption granted by him. Sec 4, which deals with the\napplication for\npermits for permanent residence in the then\n/Union\n35\nUnion (now the Republic of South Africa) and with the\ngrant\nof such permits, is not relevant for purposes of\nthis appeal. The same holds\nfor sec 5 which deals with\nthe application for and the grant of'temporary\nresidence\npermits. The relevant portion of sec 12 provides as\nfollows:\n\"(1) The provisions of section two shall not apply -\n(a) to an alien\nwho has lawfully acquired a domicile in the Union\nor\nwho, prior to the first day of February 1937, lawfully entered the Union for\npurpose of permanent residence therein; or\n(My italics).\n/ At\n36\nAt all relevant times before 13 June 1986 the word\n\"domicile\" according to sec 1 of the Aliens Act No 1\nof 1937 had the\nmeaning ascribed to it in sec 30 of the\nAdmission of Persons to the Union\nRegulation Act No 22 of\n1913, the gist of which (for purposes of this case) was\n\"the place in which a person has his present permanent\nhome or present\npermanent residence, or to which he\nreturns as his present permanent abode,\nand not for\na mere special or temporary purpose\". As from\n13 June 1986 the\nword \"domicile\" according to sec 1\nof the Aliens Act No 1 of 1937 acquired\nthe meaning\nascribed to it in sec 1 of the Admission of Persons to\nthe\nRepublic Regulation Act No 59 of\n1972. Sec 1(1)\nof the latter Act added \"subject to the provisions of\n/subsections\n37\nsubsections (2), (3) and (4)\" to the gist of the definition\nof domicile as found in sec 30 of the Admission of Persons\nto the Union\nRegulation Act No 22 of 1913, as quoted\nsupra\n.\nSec 1 (3) of the Admissions of Persons to the Republic Act\nNo 59 of 1972,\nhowever, introduced\ninter alia\nthe follow=\ning new qualification viz\n:\n\"For the purpose of this Act a person shall be deemed to have lost his\ndomicile within the Republic, in the case of any person who\nwas or is a South\nAfrican citizen, on the day on which he ceased or ceased to be a South African\ncitizen - - - - - \"\nThis new qualification, which as from 13 June 1986 formed\npart of the word \"domicile\" according to sec 1 of the Aliens Act No 1 of\n1937,\nis for purposes of this case\n/irrelevant\n38\nirrelevant inasmuch as we are concerned with the meaning\nof the word\n\"domicile\" in the said Act before the intro=\nduction of the said\nqualification. Mr\nHugo\n, on behalf\nof the respondent, contended that\nthe word \"acquired\", as\nused in sec 12(1)(a), according to its ordinary\nmeaning\ninvolved a personal effort on the part of the acquirer and\nthat\nthe appellant did not lawfully acquire a domicile in\nthe Republic of South\nAfrica. This contention overlooks\nthe fact that the appellant acquired\nex\nlege\na domicile\nby birth in the Republic of South Africa and that he\nsub=\nsequently acquired a domicile by choice at Nkquonkqweni\nwhere he was\npermanently resident. It also overlooks the\nfact that the word \"domicile\" in\nsec 12(1)(a) has the\n/meaning\n39\nmeaning ascribed to it in sec 30 of the Immigrants Regulation\nACt No 22 of 1913, the gist of which I quoted\nsupra\nas appertaining to\n\"present permanent residence\". There is therefore no merit in this contention.\nBecause the appellant was lawfully\ndomiciled and permanently resident in the\nRepublic of South Africa when he became a\nperegrinus\non 4 December 1981\nhe falls, in my judgment, within the provisions of sec 12(1)(a) of the Aliens\nAct No 1 of 1937. It follows accordingly\nthat the provisions of sec 2 of the\nlatter Act are inapplicable to the appellant who is therefore unaffected by the\nministerial notice\nof 22 December 1981, by which the respondent exempted\ncitizens of Ciskei from the requirement of being in possession of\ntemporary\n40\ntemporary residence permits, and the subsequent\nwithdrawal on 8 November 1984 of the conferred exemption. The appellant is\ntherefore\nentitled to an order that he has the right of being permanently\nresident in the Republic of South Africa without any permit or exemption.\nI now turn to deal with the question whether the appellant has a right to\nmove to and from the Republic of South Africa without a\nvisa. The position at\ncommon law prior to the Departure from the Union Regulation Act No 34 of 1955\nwhen there existed no statutory\nprovision restricting citizens of the Union of\nSouth Africa from leaving it was considered by this Court in\nSobukwe\nand\n/\nAnother\n41\nAnother v Minister of Justice\n, 1972(1) SA 693 (AD) at p\n703 C-G. According to sec 2 of Act No 34 of 1955 \"no person shall leave the\nUnion for the purpose of proceeding\nto another country -\n(a)\nunless he is, at the time\nwhen he leaves the Union, in possession of a valid passport or a\npermit;\n(b)\nexcept at a port, unless his\npassport or permit bears an endorsement - - - - -\n\"\nAccording to sec 1 of Act No 34 of 1955 the word\n\"port\" has the meaning ascribed to it by section 30 of the Admission of Persons\nto\nthe Union Regulation Act No 22 of 1913. It follows that prior to 4 December\n1981 the appellant as a citizen of the Republic of South\nAfrica\n/had\n42\nhad no unqualified right to leave this country. He had to comply with\nthe provisions of sec 2 of Act 34 of 1955. From 4 December 1981\nhe as a\nperegrinus\nhas likewise to comply with the provisions of sec 2 of Act 34\nof 1955 in order to leave this country.\nNor is there an unqualified right to enter or return to the Republic of South\nAfrica. According to sec 32(1) of the Admission of Persons\nto the Republic\nRegulation Act No 59 of 1972 \"no person shall enter the Republic at any place\nother than a port of entry\". Moreover,\nsec 40(1) of the said Act provides as\nfollows:\n\"Any\n43\n\"Any person entering the Republic who fails on demand by an immigration\nofficer to produce to him an unexpired passport or other document\nof identity of\na class recognised by the Minister -\n(a)\twhich was issued to him on behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic or on\nbehalf\nof another governmentrecognised by the\nGovernment of the Republic;\nand\n(b)\twhich contains a personal description of\nhim, the name of the country in which he was born and the date of his birth, and\nto which is attached a photograph of him, wherein\nhis features are clearly and\ncorrectly depicted; and\n(c)\twhich bears a valid visa or an endorsement\nby a person authorized thereto\nby the\nGovernment of the Republic to the effect\nthat authority to proceed\nto the Republic\nfor the purpose of being examined under\nthis Act has been\ngranted by the Minister\nor a person acting under his authority, or\nis\naccompanied by a document containing a\nstatement to that effect together\nwith\nparticulars of such passport or other\ndocument of\nidentity,\t/shall\n44.\nshall be a prohibited person,\nunless he is proved to be a\nSouth African citizen by birth or descent\n.\"\n(My italics). Furthermore,\nany person who entered this country without complying with the requirements of\nsec 40(1) is according to\nthe provisions of sec 40(4) a prohibited person\n\"\nunless it is proved that such . person is a South African citizen by birth\nor descent\n\". (My italics), Should such a prohibited person nonetheless enter\nthis country he would be liable to be arrested and removed from\nthis country\nunder a warrant issued under Act No 59 of 1972 (Sec 40(5)). Since the appellant\nceased on 4 December 1981 to be a South\nAfrican citizen by birth or descent he\ncannot at the\n/moment\n45\nmoment of entering the Republic of South Africa claim\nto\nbe\na South African citizen by birth or descent, as required by the exception\nprovided for in sec 40(1). It follows that the appellant\non entering this\ncountry must comply with the provisions of sec 40(1) such as having a valid\nvisa. Failure to do so would cause him\nto become a prohibited person subject to\nthe con= sequences of arrest and removal from the Republic of South Africa. The\nright which\nthe appellant had prior to 4 December 1981 to enter this country\nwithout a valid visa was wholly dependent on and related to his\nstatus as a\nSouth African citizen by birth or descent.\n/Loss\n46.\nLoss of this status deprived him of this right of entering\nthis country without a valid visa. It follows, in my judgment, that this\nright\nwas not an existing right, which was not dependent on and unrelated to his South\nAfrican citizenship. It cannot therefore be\nsaid to have been preserved by sec\n6(3) of the Act. The appellant is therefore not entitled to an order that he has\nthe right to\nenter the Republic of South Africa without a valid visa.\nThe appeal accordingly succeeds partially to the extent that the appellent is\nentitled to be permanent= ly resident in the Republic\nof South Africa without\nany official permission such as a permit or an exemption.\n/In\n47 In the result the following orders are granted:\nl(a) The appellant is entitled to be permanently resident in the Republic of\nSouth Africa without any permit or exemption.\n(b)\nThe appellant is not\nentitled to enter the Republic of South Africa without a valid\nvisa.\n(c)\nThe appellant is entitled to the\ncosts of appeal which are to include the costs of two\ncounsel.\n2. The following order is substituted for\nthe order of the Court\na quo\n:\n\"The relief sought in prayer (c)(i) of the Notice of Motion is granted to the\nextent that the applicant has the right to be permanently\nresident in the\nRepublic of South Africa without any permit or exemption. Sáve as\naforesaid the other relief sought in prayer\n(c)(i) of the Notice of Motion is\nrefused. The applicant is awarded his costs which are to include the costs of\ntwo counsel\".\nC.P.

    "facts": "Stephen Vukile Tshwete, born in 1938 in Springs, Transvaal, was a South African citizen by birth. He lived with his parents in Nkqonkqweni, Peelton, East London, where he was permanently resident from 1979. On 4 December 1981 the Republic of Ciskei attained sovereignty under the Status of Ciskei Act, and by virtue of section 6(1) of that Act Tshwete lost his South African citizenship and became a citizen of Ciskei. The Minister of Home Affairs issued notices in December 1981 exempting Ciskei citizens from visa and temporary residence permit requirements, but on 8 November 1984 withdrew those exemptions. Tshwete applied in the Eastern Cape Division for an order declaring his right to permanent residence in South Africa without a permit and the right to enter South Africa without a visa.",
    "issues": "1) Whether section 6(3) of the Status of Ciskei Act preserves Tshwete's pre‑existing right to permanent residence in South Africa without a permit despite his loss of South African citizenship. 2) Whether the same provision preserves his pre‑existing right to enter South Africa without a visa. 3) How the Aliens Act 1937 and related immigration regulations apply to a person who became an alien but retained lawful domicile in South Africa.",
    "principles": "The Court interpreted section 6(3) as containing an \"exception phrase\" (except as regards citizenship) and a \"recording clause\" preserving existing rights of Ciskei citizens resident in South Africa, but only insofar as they do not depend on South African citizenship. The meaning of \"citizenship\" was distinguished from \"nationality\". Under the Aliens Act 1937, an alien who has lawfully acquired a domicile in the Union is exempt from the general alien immigration restrictions (section 12(1)(a)). The Minister’s powers to grant or withdraw exemptions under section 7bis of the Aliens Act were recognized, but could not affect rights preserved by statute. The Court also considered common‑law definitions of domicile and the statutory requirements for entry and exit under the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act 1972 and the Departure from the Union Regulation Act 1955.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court held that Tshwete, although a Ciskei citizen (an alien), had lawfully domiciled and permanently resided in South Africa at the time his citizenship changed, thereby falling within the exemption of section 12(1)(a) of the Aliens Act. Consequently, the statutory provisions that required a temporary residence permit did not apply to him, preserving his right to permanent residence without a permit. However, his right to enter South Africa without a visa was directly tied to his status as a South African citizen by birth, which he no longer possessed. Therefore, that right could not be preserved under section 6(3).",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded in part. The appellant was ordered to be permanently resident in the Republic of South Africa without any permit or exemption, but he was not entitled to enter the Republic without a valid visa. The appellant was awarded costs of the appeal, including the costs of two counsel."
