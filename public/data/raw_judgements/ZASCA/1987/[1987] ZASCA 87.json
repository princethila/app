Carolina resisted the\nclaim and instituted a counterclaim. The\nmatter\nwas heard during March 1985 and in pursuance of a\njudgment handed down on 7 May 1985 (which is fully\nreported in 1985(3) SA\n633 (D), hereinafter referred\nto as \"the report\",) the learned trial Judge,\nKum-\nleben J, dismissed the claims in convention and\nreconvention with costs. Leave to appeal having\nbeen/\n3. been granted by the Court a\nquo\nto appeal to this\nCourt against that part of the order whereby the\nlearned trial Judge dismissed the appellant's claim\nwith costs, an appeal\nwas duly noted and appeal pro-\nceedings were instituted. On 25 February 1986\na\nfinal winding-up order was made against Carolina.\nThe liquidatrix who had\nreceived proper notice that\nthe appellant desired to prosecute the appeal\nindi-\ncated that she did not intend to become involved in\nthe appeal\nproceedings or to intervene in any way.\nBefore this Court there was\nconsequently no appearance\nfor Carolina. An application at the commencement of\nthe argument on appeal\nthat the name of the respon-\ndent should be altered to \"Carolina Collieries\n(Pro-\nprietary)/\n4. prietary) Limited (in liquidation)\" was granted.\nAs a perusal of the report reveals,the learned trial Judge, even though he\nupheld a special plea that, despite a written consent to\nthe jurisdic-tion, the\ntrial Court did not have jurisdiction to try the matter, nevertheless proceeded\nto state his views on the\nbreach of contract issue and decided that against the\nappellant as well.\nThe only ground advanced in this Court in\nsupport of\na contention that the Court a\nquo\nhad\njurisdiction was the written\nconsent to the jurisdic-\ntion signed on behalf of Carolina. The facts\nwhich\nare relevant for the purposes of the adjudication of\nthis issue are,\nas set out in the report at 637 B - D,\nthat the parties were neither\ndomiciled nor resident\nwithin/\n5. within the area of jurisdiction of the Court a\nquo\n,\nnor was the contract concluded or to be performed\nwithin such area. Both\nparties were therefore\nperegrini\nof the Court a\nquo\n. They\ndiffered in\nstatus, however, in the sense that the defendant\nwas, even\nthough a\nperegrinus\nof the Court, an\nincola\nof the Republic of\nSouth Africa, whereas\nthe appellant was not - it was an\nout-and-out\nperegrinus\n.\nJurisdiction (gerigtsdwang) is defined by\nVromans,\nfollowing Berlichius, as \"a lawful power\nto decide something in a case or to\nadjudicate upon\na case, and to give effect to the judgment, that is,\nto\nhave the power to compel the person condemned to\nmake/\n6.\nmake satisfaction.\" See\nWright v Stuttaford & Co\n1929\nEDL\n10\n42. In so far as South African courts are con-\ncerned their jurisdiction is the right or authority\nof entertaining\nactions or other legal proceedings\nwhich is vested in them by the state. When\nthe\nSupreme Court of South Africa was created on the es-\ntablishment of\nthe Union of South Africa by the\nSouth Africa Act, 9 Edw VII ch 9 section 95,\nthe\nSupreme Courts of the former colonies became pro-\nvincial or local\ndivisions of the Supreme Court of\nSouth Africa. These divisions retained the\njuris-\ndiction which the courts to which they succeeded\nenjoyed.\nThe statute which currently governs\nthe\nsystem/\n7. system of the Supreme Court in\nthe RSA, its several\ndivisions and their respective jurisdictions and\npowers is the Supreme\nCourt Act 59 of 1959 (herein-\nafter referred to as \"the Act\"). According to\nit\nthe original jurisdiction of each division is terri-\ntorial - it is to\nbe exercised within a particular\ngeographical area specified in the First\nSchedule\nto the Act. Section 19(1) of the Act provides\nbroadly that a\nprovincial or local division shall\nhave jurisdiction over all persons\nresiding or being\nin and in relation to all causes arising within its\narea\nof jurisdiction and all other matters of which\nit may according to law take\ncognizance.\nIn view of the indefinite wording of\ns\n19(1)/ ...\n8.\ns 19(1) of the Act and its predecessors, no\ndoubt deliberately so\ncouched because the in-tention of the legislature obviously was to inter-fere\nwith the common law as little\nas possible, re-course must be had to the\nprinciples of the common law to ascertain what competency each of the supreme\n-courts in\nthe RSA possesses to effectively adjudicate and pronounce upon a\nmatter brought before and heard by it. In the course of time it\nseems that, as\nour law on jurisdiction developed, it was also influenced to a minor extent by\nprinciples of the private inter-national\nlaw applicable in other legal\nsystems.\nFor the purposes of this appeal it will be convenient to distinguish between\nthe so-called grounds\nof/\n9. of jurisdiction by virtue of which a court would\nnormally\nipso jure\nhave jurisdiction and juris-\ndiction which is\nconferred on a court. In the\nformer category the grounds of jurisdiction - the\nrationes\njurisdictionis\n- may be classified. In\nEinwald v The German West\nAfrican Company\n5 SC 86\nDe Villiers CJ said at 91 that the grounds\nupon\nwhich jurisdiction can be exercised in respect of\nany contract over a\ndefendant without his consent,\nexpress or implied, are threefold:\n\"viz by virtue of the defendant's domicile being here, by virtue of the contract\neither having been entered into here or having to\nbe performed here, and by\nvirtue of the subject-matter in an action in\nrem\nbeing situated in this\nColony.\"\nIn the second category of cases\nwhereby\njurisdiction/\n10. jurisdiction may be conferred upon a court attach-\nment of the goods or arrest of the person ad\nfundandam\njurisdictionem\nas well as consent to jurisdiction\n(known by the term\nprorogatio\nin Roman Dutch law)\nmay be\nclassified. In this respect the learned trial\nJudge refers , at 639 of the report, to Vromans\nwho observes in his\ntreatise\nDe Foro Competenti\n1.1.7 note 12:\n\"Uyt het Gemeine Regt is een Regter competent, of door sig selfs, ofte door\ntoeval\"\nand points out that Vromans proceeds to classify,\namong others, both\nconsent and attachment as in-\nstances of jurisdiction \"door toeval\". Among\nthe\nothers Vroman includes \"door saaks t' samehang, in saken van eene natuur\nsijnde en die gevolglyk\nvan/\n11.\nvan den anderen niet konnen gescheiden werden.\" Cf\nRoberts Construction Co Ltd v Willcox Bros(Pty)'Ltd\n1962(4) SA 326(A).\nIt seems to me - and I express this view\nen\npassant\nand of course\nobiter\n- that there is, in\nso far as South\nAfrican law is concerned, another\ntype of case,arising from the provisions of\ns 9\nof the Act, which may be added to this category.\nThis section reads as\nfollows:\n\"(1) If any civil cause, proceeding or matter has been instituted in any\npro-vincial or local division, and it is made to appear to\nthe court concerned\nthat the same may be more conveniently or more fitly heard or determined in\nanother division, that court may,\nupon appli-cation by any party thereto and\nafter hearing all other parties thereto, order such cause, proceeding or matter\nto be\nremoved/\n12. removed to that other division.\n(2) An order for removal under sub-section (1) shall be transmitted to the\nregistrar of the division to which the removal is ordered,\nand upon the receipt\nof such order that division may hear and determine the cause, proceeding or\nmatter in guestion and shall in\nthat event apply the practice governing the\ndivision in which it was instituted and the law according to which that division\nwould\nbut for the removal have heard and determined such cause, proceeding or\nmatter.\"\nIn\nFraser v Lee\n1904 TS 377\nan\napplication\nby the defendant, the plaintiff consenting, under\ns 29 of Proclamation 14\nof 1902 (the forerunner in\nthe Transvaal of s 9 of the Act), for the venue\nto\nbe changed from the Supreme Court of the Transvaal\nto the Witwatersrand\nHigh Court, was granted. The\nlatter/\n13.\nlatter court also had jurisdiction. At 378 Solomon\nJ said:\n\"It may be that if the Johannesburg court\nhad no jurisdiction whatsoever, either\nover the cause or over the defendant, by\nreason of the fact that he resided out\nof the jurisdiction of the court, some\ndifficulty might have arisen. I express\nno opinion whatsoever about that \t\"\nIn a long line of later cases this point,\nwhich was\nleft open in the\nFraser v Lee\ncase was\ndecided, the courts holding\nthat it was not necessa-\nry for the transferee court to have\njurisdiction;\nin other words,the practice seems now to be firmly\nestablished that\njurisdiction can in this manner\nbe conferred upon a court. See the cases\ncollected\nin Nathan Barnett & Brink\nUniform Rules of Court\n3rd edition at 562. It is submitted by the authors\nthat/\n14. that, although the court to which it is sought to\nremove the proceedings need not originally have had\njurisdiction, the fact that it has no jurisdiction\nwill be a matter to be\ntaken into account in deciding\nwhether the application for removal should be\ngranted.\nIt is not necessary, for the purposes of this case,\nto express any view on\nthe correctness of this sub-\nmission.\nBut to revert to the present case - the\ncrisp point\nto be decided is whether a consent to the\njurisdiction can stand alone as conferring jurisdic-\ntion on a court or\nwhether it serves merely to supply,\ncomplementarily to some\ncausa\njurisdictionis\n, an\nelement to the jurisdiction which would, but for\nsuch/\n15. such consent, be defective. The latter was the view\nof the learned trial Judge.\nThe question arises of what relevance,\napart from\nthe fact that they are both considered\nto be instances of jurisdiction \"door\ntoeval\", arrest\nor attachmeht ad\nfundandam iurisdictionem\nis to\nthe\npresent problem concerning prorogation. They have\nthis in common, as\npointed out in the report at\n639 H - J, that neither can be regarded as one\nof\nthe ordinary\nrationes iurisdictionis\nwhich are\ntraditionally\nbased on the doctrine of effective-\nness. The anology is, in my view,\nimportant because\nit has repeatedly been stressed by the authorities\nand\nin decisions of the courts, that effectiveness\nis the/\n16. is the basis of jurisdiction. This doctrine of\neffectiveness was thorougly probed by Potgieter JA\nin the matter of\nThermo Radiant Oven Sales (Pty) Ltd v\nNelspruit\nBakeries (Pty) Ltd\n1969(2) SA 295 (A) 305C - 310t\nand I need not add\nanything in this regard.\nOn behalf of the appellant it was submitted\nthat,\nuntil the decision in\nTowers v Paisley\n1963(1)\nSA 92 (E) it appears to\nhave been generally accepted\nthat consent was sufficient to confer\njurisdiction.\nWe were referred to Pollak\nSouth African Law\nof\nJurisdiction\n92 and an article\nThe Civil\nJurisdiction\nof the Supreme Court of South Africa\nby the\nsame\nauthor in Vol XLVI\n(1929) SALJ 237\nat 241 and also\nto the decision in\nSonia Proprietary Limited v Wheeler\n1958(1)/\n17. 1958(1) SA 555(A) 563C - F.\nIn\nTowers v Paisley supra\nJennett JP held\n(at 95A) that a peregrine plaintiff had always been\nable to sue a\nperegrine defendant only if one of\nthe three grounds of jurisdiction viz\nratione rei\nsitae\n,\nratione rei gestae\nor\nratione\ncontractus\nexisted and that consequently the applicant, being\na\nperegrinus\nas far as the court was concerned,\ncould not bring an\naction against the respondent\non the ground only that the latter had\nconsented to\nthe court having jurisdiction (95E). In arriving\nat this\nconclusion the learned Judge President de-\nrived support from the law\nrelating to arrest and\nattachment/\n18.\nattachment ad\nfundandam jurisdictionem\n. The\nlearned\nJudge President said at 94 F:\n\"In the case of action against a\nperegrinus\n, the Courts of the four\nProvinces before Union allowed a plaintiff\nincola\nto sue such\nperegrinus\nprovided there was a ground'of jurisdiction\nratione rei\nsitae\n,\nratione rei gestae\nor\nratione contractus\nwith an arrest\nof the defendant or attachment of some of his property.\"\nIt was pointed out on behalf of the appellant that the\ndictum\ndid not\nexpress the law correctly because in the case of an\nincola\nin the\nTransvaal, at any rate, no ground of jurisdiction other than arrest was required\nand we were referred to\nPollak/\n19. Pollak op\ncit\n58 - 9. It appears, however, that\nthe learned Judge President did not quite intend\nto say what is reported\nat 94F because he proceeds\nto say in the second sentence of the very\nnext\nparagraph (94G):\n\"In addition, however, a plaintiff\nincola\ncould sue a defendant\nperegrinus even if none of the three grounds referred to were present but there\nhad been an arrest of the defendant\nor attachment of some of his property.\"\nIt is true, however, that in the case\nof a plaintiff\nincola\nin the Transvaal no ground of\njurisdiction other than arrest of the defendant\nperegrinus\nor\nattachment of his property was required.\nIn fact, the practice which obtained in the Transvaal\n(see/\n20. (see\nLecomte v W & B Syndicate of Madagascar\n1905\nTH 295;\n1905 TS 696)\nwas subsequently approved and\nfollowed in the Cape\n(see\nHalse v Warwick\n1931 CPD 233).\nIn the case of a defendant\nperegrinus\nwho is, however,resident in another province of the RSA\ndifferent considerations apply. As Jennett JP points out in\nTowers v Paisley\nsupra\nat 94 in\nfine\n, by s 5 of Act 27 of 1912 arrest of the person or\nattachment of his property was prohibited in such a case. As a result the right\nof an\nincola\nto found juris-diction solely on the arrest of such a\nperegrinus\ndisappeared.\nHe/\n21. He correctly interpreted s 5 of Act 27 of\n1912\nas\nprohibiting\narrest of the person or attach-\nment of his property in\nrespect of a defendant\nperegrinus\nwho was resident in another\nprovince.\nThe relevant portion of the section provided:\n\"Whenever a defendant resides in the Union no attach-\nment of his person\nor property to found jurisdiction\nshall be ordered.\" In this respect Pollak op\ncit\n68 expresses the\nview that Maasdorp CJ in\nSmit v\nCramer\n1913 OPD 123\nand\nKotzé J in\nBrooks v Maquassi\nHalls Ltd\n1914 CPD 371\nwrongly interpreted the section\nnot as prohibiting but merely as doing away\nwith the\nnecessity of an arrest of the person or attachment\nof his property to found jurisdiction. This difficulty\nwas compounded by s 7 of Act 27 of 1912 which provided\nthat/\n22.\nthat:\n\"Nothing in the preceding sections of this Act shall be construed as con-ferring\nupon any court jurisdiction to hear and determine\nany matter which it would not\nhave had authority to hear and determine if the defendant had been served with a\ncivil summons within\nthe jurisdiction of the court wherein the proceedings are\nbeing taken.\"\nAbout this section Pollak correctly remarks\n(\nop cit\n67 n 1) that it is impossible to give effect\nto the literal\nmeaning thereof without restricting\nthe jurisdiction of the divisions of the\nSupreme\nCourt in actions against persons who reside in the\nUnion of South\nAfrica to the case in which the\ndefendant is an\nincola\nof the area to\nwhich the\ncourt belongs.\nA proper/\n23. A proper reading of s 5 might'well,\nas Pollak at\n68 of op\ncit\npoints out, have led to\nthe construction that with the\nprohibition of arrest\nand attachment to found jurisdiction the\ndivisions\nof the Supreme Court had indirectly lost their juris-\ndiction to\nentertain an action against a peregrine\ndefendant who resided in the Union\neven though the\ncause of action arose or the contract in respect of\nwhich\nthe plaintiff's claim was brought was entered\ninto within the area to which\nthe court belonged.\nS 5 of Act 27 of 1912 has now been re-enacted in\ns\n28(1) of the Act in the following terms:\n\"No attachment of person or property to . found jurisdiction shall be ordered by\na court of any division against a person\nwho is resident in the Republic.\"\nSection/\n24. Section 7 has, however, not been re-enacted.\nNo\ndoubt, to meet the objection to the possible, and\nin Pollak's view the correct, construction of s 5 and\nthe difficulty in\nconstruing s 7 of Act 27 of 1912,\ns 19(3) of the Act now provides:\n\"The provisions of this section shall not be construed as in any way limiting\nthe powers of a provincial or local division as existing\nat the commence-ment of\nthis Act, or as depriving any such divísion of any jurisdiction which\ncould lawfully be exercised\nby it at such\ncommencement.\"\nIn my view this provision now sanctions\nthe\nconstruction placed upon s 5 of Act 27 of 1912\nby Maasdorp and Kotzé J\nin\nSmit v Cramer supra\nand\nBrooks v Maquassi Halls Ltd supra\nrespectively.\nThe prohibition is still there in s 28(1) of the\nAct/\n25. Act but s 19(3) now provides in effect that the\nprohibition does not in any way deprive a court of\nany jurisdiction which\ncould lawfully have been\nexercised by it prior to the provision. Such\njurisdiction could only have been exercised by\nvirtue of one of the\ngrounds of jurisdiction. In\nBrooks v Maquassi Halls Ltd supra\nKotzé J said at\n376 - 377:\n\"According to our common law and practice under it, the Court will exercise\njuris-diction upon any one of the following grounds,\nviz:\n(1)\nRatione domicilii\n; (2)\nratione rei sitae\n; (3)\nratione\ncontractus\n; that is, where the contract has either been en-tered into or has\nto be executed within the jurisdiction. This is a correct statement\nof the law\nas summarised by Burge in his\nCommentaries\n, vol 3, chap 24, and has\ngenerally been adopted by our courts. But,in order to exercise\njuris-\ndiction/\n26.\ndiction under either the second or third ground which I have mentioned, the\nprac-tice has always been to grant an arrest either of\nthe property or person of\nthe debtor ad\nfundandam iurisdictionem\n, and in this way the debtor or his\nproperty, to use the expressive language of the Dutch lawyers, becomes bankvast.\nThere is, therefore,\nalways something against which, in the event of the\njudgment being in favóur of the plaintiff, the decree of the Court can\noperate, and not amount to a mere nullity, for the Court, like nature, should do\nnothing in vain. There is yet a fourth means of\nexercising juris-diction,\nclearly recognised by the Roman-Dutch law, and which has been adopted in our\nSouth African practice, although\nit seems that the cases in the courts of this\nProvince are not quite uniform on the point, viz, where, upon the applica-tion\nof an\nincola\n, the court will grant an attachment of a foreigner or of his\nproperty found within the territorial limits in order to establish jurisdiction.\nIt is, however, not necessary to pursue this question any further in the present\napplication.\nSuch/\n27.\nSuch was the law at the time when Act 27 of 1912 was passed, by which some\nimportant changes have been introduced in the existing\npractice. The Act (secs\n3, 5 and 7) has not increased the jurisdiction of the Court over a defendant in\nregard to the subject-matter\nof the suit, it has merely simplified the\nprocedure. It has done away with the necessity of an attachment of person or\nproperty to\nfound jurisdiction, and of edictal citation where the summons can be\nduly served in some other manner. It has thus dispensed with\nthe inconvenience\nand cost of such proceedings. As I understand the three sections read together,\nit comes to this: Sec 5 provides\nthat a creditor or plaintiff, resident in one\nProvince of the Union, can in the court of his Province sue the defendant\nresident\nin another Pro-vince, without the process of attachment and without\nedictal citation, if the defen-dant can be duly served with a\nsummons in some\nother way, e g, by personal service, provided (as sec 3 requires) that the court\nout of which the summons issues\nhas juris-diction in respect of the matter or\npro-ceedings in which the summons is taken out; while sec 7, as the marginal\nnote correctly\nindicates, simply provides that no greater\njurisdiction/...\n28.\njurisdiction is conferred upon the court out of which the summons issues than\nthat which it already possesses in regard to the subject-matter\nor\nproceedings.\"\nThus, section 28 read with s 19(3) of\nthe Act\nfacilitates the procedure as far as\neffectiveness is concerned, but\neffectiveness\ndoes not\nper se\nconfer jurisdiction on a court.\nThe\nfact that in this case the respondent was not\na\nperegrinus\nin the full\nsense of the word, as\ncounsel put it, and the reliance on\nRoberts\nCon\n-\nstruction Company Limited v Willcox Brothers\n(Proprietary) Limited supra\n, does not, in\nmy view, assist the\nappellant. See also\nEstate\nAqents Board v Lek\n1979(3) SA 1048\n(A) 1061B - 1063E.\nTo/\n29.\nTo deal more directly and specifically\nwith\nprorogation, I revert to the other references\nrelied upon by counsel for the appellant. I do not read the references to Pollak\nop\ncit\n92 and the author's article in\n1929 SALJ 237\n241 or to\nSonia's\ncase\nsupra\nas being authority for the proposition that\nconsent to the jurisdiction by a peregrine defendant\nper se\nconfers\njurisdiction on the court concerned. In his book and in the article referred to\nPollak was dealing with jurisdiction over\nthe person only and not juris-diction\nof the court generally. In his book on\nJurisdiction\nPollak s v \"When the\nDefendant is a Corporation\" mentions at 91/2 seven cases in which, when the\ndefendant in an action sounding\nin money\nis a/\n30. is a natural person, South African courts exercise\njurisdiction. Among these he includes a defen-\ndant who submits to the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe learned author then\nproceeds to deal with the\nsituation in which the defendant in an action is\na\ncorporation. Pollak does not however say that sub-\nmission alone confers\njurisdiction on the court.\nAt 84/5 he deals with submission by a defendant\nto\nthe jurisdiction of the court and refers to Voet\n2.1.35 and to a passage in\nUeckermann v Feinstein\n1909 T5 913 920. This passage appears in a\ndictum\nof Innes CJ at 919 - 920 which I quote in full:\n\"There remains the much more difficult question, whether acquiescence in a\njudgment in\npersonam\n, pronounced by a court competent as to the cause,\nagainst\na defendant/\n31.\na defendant over whose person the court had at the time no jurisdiction,\noperates to prevent such defendant from thereafter challenging\nthe validity of\nthe judgment. The inquiry may be put in a different shape - could such a\ndefendant, under such cir-cumstances, have\nconferred jurisdiction originally\nupon the court by consent? Be-. cause, if he could consent originally, it\nfollows that he could\nacquiesce subsequently. Apart from statute, the common law\nof Holland undoubtedly recognised the doctrine of the prorogation of\njurisdiction\n- that is, that jurisdiction might be conferred or extended by\nconsent of parties so as to enable the court to deal with a dispute\nwhich, apart\nfrom such consent, it would have had no jurisdiction to entertain. And that\nproro-gation of jurisdiction might take\nplace in regard to inferior as well as\nsuperior courts is clear from what Voet says at 2, 1, 15. Some of the\nauthorities favoured\na very wide application being given to this doctrine of\nprorogation. But I think it must be recognised as settled law in South\nAfricá\nthat there can be no prorogation in regard to cases where the\ncourt has no authority at all to adjudicate upon the\nsubject-matter/...\n32.\nsubject-matter of the dispute; because in such cases, the matter at issue being\nby law outside the cognisance of the court, the consent\nof parties cannot confer\na coercive jurisdiction upon the court, which the law expressly denies to\nit.\"\nIn XLVI\n(1929) SALJ 241\nPollak expresses the view\nthat it\nis only common sense that a defendant who\nexpressly consents to the plaintiff\nbringing his\naction in a particular division of the Supreme Court,\nshould\nnot be allowed thereafter to object to the\njurisdiction of such division. Again, nowhere in\nthis article does Pollak\nstate that consent alone\nconfers jurisdiction upon a court.\nThe\ndictum\nin\nSonia's\ncase\nsupra\nat 563\nC\nwhich is relied on reads as follows:\n\"Save for the principle of submission, that\nis,/\n33.\nis, a voluntary submission by a defendant to the Court exercising jurisdiction\nover him which it does not possess in law, the basic\nprinciple of jurisdiction\nis effec-tiveness. (\nSchlimmer v Executrix in Estate of Rising\n,\n1904 TH\n108\nat p 111). This point is fully discussed by Mr Pollak in his book on\nJurisdiction\nfrom p 15 onwards. He quotes several\ndicta\n, one from\nan American case -\nMcDonald v Mabee\n243 U S 90\n(1917) where Holmes, J\nsaid: 'The foundation of jurisdiction is physical\npower.'\"\nI do not read this passage as indicating\nthat\nprorogation or submission by itself confers\njurisdiction on a court. Regard being had to the\ncontext in which the\ncomment was made by Price AJA\nit is evident that the court did have\njurisdiction\nover the cause. As far as the person of the defen-\ndant was\nconcerned Price AJA distinguished between\na/\n34. a defendant who submits to the jurisdiction and\none who does not do so. In my view, the effect\nof the judgment is that, in\nthe latter case, the\nadded requirement of effectiveness has to be\nsatis-\nfied. That would be attained by the arrest of the\nperson or\nattachment of his property in the area\nof jurisdiction of the court. Were he\nan\nincola\nof the Republic though a\nperegrinus\nof the\ncourt,\nsuch arrest or attachment would, in view of the\nremoval by\nlegislation of certain procedural impe-\ndiments, no longer be necessary. (563\nE - H) The\nwords \"submission by the Defendant to the Court\nexercising\njurisdiction over him which it does not\npossess in law\" in the passage quoted\nabove must be\nread/\n35. read in the restricted sense in which it was in-\ntended to apply. The emphasis must be placed on\nthe word\nhim.\nThat\nthis was the connotation in\nwhich the remark by Price AJA should be read\nac-\nquires added force when regard is had to a passage\nby Pollak op\ncit\n19 to which Price AJA refers and the\nfootnote thereto. The passage reads as follows:\n\"For reasons of policy it is held that a person who voluntarily submits himself\nto the judgment of the court, to whose jurisdiction\nhe would not otherwise be\nsubject, confers, by so doing, juris-diction on such court and that he cannot\nafterwards be heard to say\nthat the court had no jurisdiction over\nhim.\"\nIn the footnote to this passage reference is made\nto\nUeckerman v Feinstein supra\n, a passage from which\nI quoted above and to\nOtto v Schurïnk and Another\n1911 TPD\n367\nin/\n36.\nin which case it was clear that the magistrate's\ncourt had jurisdiction as to the cause. At 374\nWessels J, after having referred to Vinnius, said:\n\"In other words, if a Magistrate has jurisdiction over a cause, and a party\ndefendant acquiesces in the judgment of the Magistrate,\nit is too late for him\nto say that all the necessary for-malities have not been complied with.\"\nMr Shaw also sought to draw a distinc-\ntion between the law relating to\narrest and attach-\nment ad\nfundandam iurisdictionem\nand\nprorogation.\nAs it seems probable, he argues,that the right of\narrest was a privilege extended to\nincolae\n(see\nWessels History of\nthe Roman Dutch Law 690-1) the\nrule of the South African law refusing the right of\narrest/\n37.\narrest to a peregrinus, except where there is a\nground of\njurisdiction other than arrest, is gene-rally in accordance with the common law.\nThese considerations, he submits, clearly\nhowever do not apply with regard to a\nconsent to jurisdiction where there is no element of enforcing appearance.\nNo\ndirect authority, either in our case law or in the Roman-Dutch law, has been\nquoted to this Court in support of this proposition.\nOn the contrary, the\ndictum\nof Innes CJ in\nUeckermann v Feinstein supra\nto the effect\nthat there can be no prorogation in regard to cases where the court has no\nauthority at all to adjudicate upon the\nsubject-matter of the dispute, has never\nbeen departed from\nin this/\n38. in this country. The phrase \"The consent of the\nparties cannot confer a coercive jurisdiction upon\nthe court\" in the\ndictum\nreferred to is derived\nfrom\nFarquharson v Morgan\n1894 1 QB 552\nin which\ncase Lord Davey\nsaid:\n\"Parties cannot by agreement confer upon any court or judge a coercive\njurisdic-tion which the court or judge does not by law\npossess\".\nThese words were quoted by Mason J in\nEllis v\nMorgan; Ellis v Dessai\n1909 TS 576\n582 and, as appears above, referred to by\nInnes CJ in the\nUeckermann v Feinstein\njudgment\nsupra\n.\nThe\ncrucial question that presents itself is: what jurisdiction does a Supreme Court\nin S A law possess?\nA court/\n39.\nA court can only be said to have jurisdiction in a\nmatter if it has the power not only of taking cog-\nnisance of the suit but also of giving effect to\nits judgment. (See\nSteytler NO v Fitzgerald\n1911\nAD 295\n346/7). By\nvirtue of the provisions of s 28(1)\nof the Act (and, of course, its\npredecessor, s 5 of\nAct 27 of 1912, which was worded very similarly)\nthe\nprocedural impediment in so far as effectiveness in\nrespect of any\nperson resident in the Republic is\nconcerned has been eliminated but it still\nhas to be\nestablished in every case that, in terms of s 19(1) of\nthe Act,\na court has the power of taking cognisance of\nthe suit. In the matter of\nThe Owners Master and Crew of the S S\"Humber\"v\nThe Owners and Master of the S S\n\"\nAnswald\n\"1912 AD 546 554 Innes ACJ referred to the con-\nclusion/\n40.\nclusion to which the court had come in\nBeckett &\nCo\nv\nKroomer\nas to the interpretation of the words \"causes\narising\" in s\n16 of the Transvaal Adminstration of\nJustice Proclamation (the very words\nwhich appear in\ns 19(1) of the Act) as being:\n\"... that the expression 'causes arising' formed the dominating feature of the\nsection; and that when a Court was given unlimited\njurisdiction in all 'causes\narising' within a certain area, that amounted to a jurisdiction to entertain all\nsuits for which, by\nthe common law of the Colony, the highest Court of first\ninstance would in that area be the proper forum. The presence of a contemplated\ndefendant would of course be an important element in the inquiry; but the\nquestion in each instance would be whether the particular'cause'was\none of which\nthe Court concerned could, according to the principles of law, rightly take\ncogni-\nzance\tThe claim being based upon\ntort, and the Provincial Division being\nneither/\n41.\nneither the\nforum loci delicti\nnor the\nforum rei\n, it is clear\nthat, apart from the machinery of arrest, that inquiry would have to be answered\nin the negative.\"\nThis\ndictum\nagain emphasises the\nprinciple that in addition to the machinery of arrest (which, in the case of a\nlocal\nperegrinus\n, is dispensed with by law) something more is required\nbefore a court can take cognisance of a matter in its area of juris-diction.\nBy\nprorogation a defendant subjects his person to the jurisdiction of the court,\nbut that is not enough. One or more of the traditional\ngrounds of jurisdiction\nmust also be present.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that\nthe consent of the defendant did not\nconfer/\n42.\nconfer any jurisdiction on the Court a\nquo\nand that\nthe latter had\nno authority to take cognisance of the matter. The appeal cannot, therefore,\nsucceed on the jurisdiction point. It\nis, consequently, not necessary to\nconsider the breach of contract issue.\nMr Shaw has not addressed us on the\nques-tion of costs. Some costs might have been incurred both before and after\nthe liquidation\nof Carolina in respect of, for instance, the receipt and\ncon-sideration of documents served upon it or the execu-trix. Under these\ncircumstances it is only just, in my view, to order the appellant to pay the\ncosts of appeal.\nIn the/\n43.\nIn the result the appeal is dismissed,\nwith costs.\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nSMALBERGER JA )\nVIVIER JA )\n- Concur\nBOSHOFF AJA ) STEYN AJA )",

    "facts": "The Italian company Veneta Mineraria Spa sued Carolina Collieries (Pty) Ltd for breach of contract, interest and costs in the Durban and Coast Local Division. Carolina counterclaimed. The trial judge dismissed both claims with costs. An appeal was noted, but before the Supreme Court of Appeal Carolina went into liquidation and did not appear. The central factual dispute concerned whether the Supreme Court division had jurisdiction, given that both parties were not domiciled or resident within the court's territorial jurisdiction and the contract was neither concluded nor to be performed there. The only alleged basis for jurisdiction was a written consent to the court's jurisdiction signed by Carolina.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised the question whether a written consent by a peregrine defendant can, by itself, confer jurisdiction on a South African Supreme Court division, or whether traditional grounds of jurisdiction (ratione domicilii, ratione rei sitae, ratione contractus) must also be satisfied. A subsidiary issue was whether the court could entertain the breach‑of‑contract claim at all.",
    "principles": "The court considered the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959, especially sections 19(1), 19(3) and 28(1), and the common‑law grounds of jurisdiction (ratione domicilii, rei sitae, contractus). It reviewed the doctrine of effectiveness, the historic requirement of arrest or attachment to give a court coercive power, and the doctrine of prorogation of jurisdiction. Relevant precedents included Towers v Paisley, Einwald v German West African Company, Thermo Radiant Oven Sales v Nelspruit Bakeries, and the writings of Pollak on consent and jurisdiction. The court affirmed that consent alone does not create jurisdiction where the court lacks authority over the subject‑matter, echoing Innes CJ’s dictum and the principle from Farquharson v Morgan that parties cannot confer coercive jurisdiction by agreement.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that both Veneta Mineraria Spa and Carolina Collieries were peregrini with respect to the Durban division; the contract was neither concluded nor performed within the division’s territory; and the written consent was the sole alleged basis for jurisdiction. Because the statutory provisions do not create jurisdiction and consent does not satisfy the effectiveness requirement, the court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the consent of the defendant did not confer jurisdiction on the court, and therefore the court had no authority to take cognisance of the dispute. Costs of the appeal were ordered against the appellant, Veneta Mineraria Spa."
