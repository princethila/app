In\n2012 the\r\nappellant’s property was flooded, when storm water directed\r\ninto a stream across the municipality’s land adjacent\nto it was\r\nunable to flow away, because the latter property had become overgrown\r\nand the stream was blocked by vegetation.\n[2]\r\nAs a result of the flooding, and pursuant to an application by the\r\nappellant, the North Gauteng High Court, Pretoria (Kubushi\nJ) granted\r\njudgment in its favour on 17 October 2012 in the following terms:\n‘\n1.\r\nThe Respondent is ordered to immediately remove the nuisance caused\r\nby the blocking and silting of the stormwater drainage canal\nbetween\r\nPotgieter and Cohen Streets, Phalaborwa Extension 1 Township by\r\nimmediately removing all soil, silt, foliage and/or any\nother\r\nmaterial obstructing the flow of stormwater therein;\n2.\r\nIn the event of the Respondent failing to complete the remedial work\r\nnecessary in order to comply with 1 above before 17 November\n2012,\r\nthe applicant is hereby authorised to do such remedial work;\n3.\r\nAny costs expended by the Applicant pursuant to the remedial work\r\nauthorised in 2 above, is immediately payable by the Respondent\nto\r\nthe Applicant upon presentation by the Applicant of certified copies\r\nof all invoices to the Respondent reflecting the costs\nexpended in\r\nconnection therewith;\n4.\r\nThe Respondent is ordered to commence with the construction and\r\ninstallation of a subsurface drainage system along the entire\nlength\r\nof the stormwater canal on or before 1 February 2013 and to complete\r\nthe construction thereof on or before 1 May 2013;\n5.\r\nIn the event of the Respondent failing to commence with the\r\nconstruction of the subsurface drainage system in 4 above,\nalternatively\nin the event of the Respondent commencing with\r\nthe construction thereof before 1 February 2013, but not completing\r\nsame by 1 May\n2013, the Applicant is authorised to attend to the\r\ninstallation of any of the three construction methods proposed in the\r\nreport\nby N Kruger Consulting Engineers, dated 2 November 2011,\r\nattached hereto as Annexure “O”;\n6.\r\nAny costs expended by the Applicant pursuant to the remedial work\r\nauthorised in 6 above is immediately payable by the Respondent\nupon\r\npresentation by the Applicant of certified copies of all invoices\r\nreflecting the costs expanded in connection therewith to\nthe\r\nRespondent;\n7.\r\nThe Respondent is ordered to pay the costs of this application on a\r\nscale as between attorney and client.’\n[3]\r\nIt is common cause that the respondent, despite numerous reminders by\r\nthe appellant, failed to comply with the court order.\nAs a result,\r\nthe appellant, acting in terms of paragraphs 2 and 5 of the court\r\norder, contracted Rimiro Construction Civil &\nBuilding (Rimiro)\r\nto do the remedial work during or about October 2013.\n[4]\r\nIt was only during or about March 2014 that the respondent sent a\r\nservice provider Mame Projects CC to the site to commence\nwith the\r\nremedial work. At this stage the appellant had already commenced with\r\nthe remedial work. According to the respondent,\nthe appellant\r\nunlawfully erected a fence which effectively denied its service\r\nprovider access to the site to undertake the remedial\nwork. It\r\nbrought an urgent application for the demolition of the fence and an\r\norder that its service provider be granted access\nthrough the\r\nappellant’s property. The main allegation was that there was\r\nonly one access point to the site where the remedial\nwork had to be\r\ndone through the appellant’s property on Von Wielligh Street.\n[5]\r\nIn its answering affidavit, the appellant pertinently denied that the\r\nrespondent has to go through its property to reach or\ngain access to\r\nthe site. It specifically stated that, contrary to what the\r\nrespondent averred, its property does not border on\nPotgieter Street\r\nwhere the respondent required access but on Von Wielligh Street.\r\nImportantly, it alleged that the respondent could\ngain access either\r\nfrom Potgieter Street or by traversing other properties adjacent to\r\nthe canal.\nThe respondent disputed this\r\nsaying that it could not get access for unspecified heavy machinery\r\nother than through the appellant’s\nproperty.\n[6]\r\nSelf-evidently this presented a serious dispute of facts which could\r\nnot be resolved on the papers. Neither of the parties requested\nthat\r\nthe matter be referred to trial or for oral evidence to resolve the\r\ndispute. Notwithstanding the serious dispute on the facts,\nthe court\r\nbelow proceeded to grant judgment in favour of the respondent on 20\r\nMay 2014. Aggrieved by the judgment, the appellant\nis appealing to\r\nthis Court with the leave of the court below.\n[7]\r\nAn applicant who approaches a court for final relief on notice of\r\nmotion where it has reason to believe that facts essential\nto the\r\nsuccess of its claim will probably be disputed, chooses such a\r\nprocedure at its own peril. This is such a case. The appellant\n\npertinently disputed that the only access point to get to the site\r\nwas through its property. It gave details of alternative access\n\npoints which were available to the respondent.\n[8]\r\nAs already indicated in paragraph 5, the respondent knew that the\r\nissue of the access point was seriously disputed by the appellant.\n\nNotwithstanding such knowledge, it elected to adopt motion\r\nproceedings. As it was stated by this Court in\nTamarillo (Pty) Ltd\r\nv B N Aitken (Pty) Ltd\n1982 (1) 398 (A) at 430H:\n‘\nA\r\nlitigant is entitled to seek relief by way of notice of motion. If he\r\nhas reason to believe that facts essential to the success\nof his\r\nclaim will probably be disputed he chooses that procedural form at\r\nhis peril, for the Court in the exercise of its discretion\nmight\r\ndecide neither to refer the matter for trial nor to direct that oral\r\nevidence on the disputed facts be placed before it,\nbut to dismiss\r\nthe application. (\nRoom Hire Co (Pty) Ltd\r\nv Jeppe Street Mansions (Pty) Ltd\n1949\r\n(3) SA 1155\n(T) at 1168.)’\nTo\r\nmy mind this is a case where the court below should have referred the\r\nmatter for the hearing of oral evidence on this disputed\nissue or\r\npossibly to trial. It follows that the court below erred in granting\r\nfinal relief in circumstances where there was a genuine\ndispute of\r\nfacts on a material aspect of the case.\nRoom Hire Co (Pty) Ltd v\r\nJeppe Street Mansions (Pty) Ltd\n1949 (3) SA 1155\n(T) at 1168;\nPlascon-Evans Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd\n[1984] ZASCA 51\n;\n1984 (3) SA\r\n623\n(A).\n[9]\r\nThis conclusion would ordinarily have resulted in the appeal being\r\nupheld and the matter being referred back to the high court\nfor the\r\nhearing of evidence. But another matter came to the fore during the\r\nhearing of the appeal. On 15 April 2014 the appellant’s\nservice\r\nprovider prepared a report which indicated that the remedial work\r\nmight be completed by 23 May 2014. Based on this, the\ncourt enquired\r\nfrom the appellant’s counsel before us, what the current status\r\nof the remedial work was. Counsel for both\nparties confirmed to the\r\ncourt that the remedial work which had to be done in terms of the\r\ncourt order of 17 October 2012 had been\ncompleted. Self-evidently,\r\nthis rendered the appeal moot.\nSection 16(2)(\na\n)(i) of the\r\nSuperior Courts Act 10 of 2013 (the Act) provides that:\n‘\nWhen\r\nat the hearing the issues are of such a nature that the decision\r\nsought will have no practical effect or result, the appeal\nmay be\r\ndismissed on this ground alone.’\n[10]\r\nThe order which the respondent sought and which was granted by the\r\ncourt below was, firstly to grant the appellant access to\nthe storm\r\nwater drainage canal between Potgieter and Cohen Streets, and\r\nsecondly to remove any fence or obstruction on the appellant’s\n\nproperty which denied the respondent access. As alluded to in the\r\nprevious paragraph the remedial work has already been finished.\nThe\r\npertinent question is what practical effect any order as granted by\r\nthe court below would still have for the respondent, as\nthere is\r\nnothing to be done. Manifestly, such an order will be an ‘academic\r\nexercise with no practical effect’ now\nor in the future.\r\nRecently this Court reiterated the principle as follows in\nTecmed\r\nAfrica (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Health & another\n[2012] 4 All\r\nSA 149\n(SCA) para 20-21:\n‘\nFinally,\r\ncourts should and ought not to decide issues of academic interest\r\nonly. That much is trite. In\nRadio Pretoria\nthis Court\r\nexpressed its concern about the proliferation of appeals that had no\r\nprospect of being heard on the merits as the order\nsought\r\nwould have no practical effect. It referred to\nRand Water Board v\r\nRotek Industries (Pty) Ltd\n2003 (4) SA 58\n(SCA) para 26 where the\r\nfollowing was said:\n“\nThe\r\npresent case is a good example of this Court's experience in the\r\nrecent past, including unreported cases, that there is a growing\n\nmisperception that there has been a relaxation or dilution of the\r\nfundamental principle . . . that Courts will not make determinations\n\nthat will have no practical effect”.\nThe\r\ncumulative effect of all of the factors that I have alluded to is\r\nthat no practical effect or result can be achieved in this\ncase. And\r\nfor those reasons the appeal was dismissed in terms of s 21A(1) of\r\nthe Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959.’\nHowever,\r\nwere we to dismiss the appeal on this ground, manifest unfairness\r\nwould arise because the appellant would be left to bear\nthe burden of\r\nan adverse order for costs in the high court.\n[11]\r\nI now turn to deal with the issue of costs. As already indicated in\r\nparagraph 5, the court order which is on appeal before\nus was made on\r\n20 May 2014. According to a letter from Rimiro, they returned to the\r\nsite on 1 March 2014 to continue with the remedial\nwork. They\r\nestimated that they would complete the remedial work by 23 May 2014.\r\nBoth parties are resident in the same area. The\nappellant’s\r\nproperty abuts the site where the remedial work had to be done whilst\r\nthe respondent has jurisdiction over the\narea where the site is. Even\r\nthe most elementary investigation would have alerted them timeously\r\nthat the remedial work had been\ndone. This would have enabled them to\r\navoid any unnecessary appearance with concomitant wasted costs before\r\nus. They failed to\ndo so. None of the parties was able to offer any\r\nplausible or acceptable explanation. I find that both parties were\r\nremiss and\nare equally to blame. Equity and fairness dictate that\r\neach party must bear its own costs. In the light of my conclusion\r\nthat the\ncourt below should not have granted an order without hearing\r\nevidence, its order cannot stand and each party should bear its own\n\ncosts in that court as well.\n[12]\r\nIn the result the appeal is upheld and the order of the court below\r\nis substituted with the following:\n‘\nThe\r\napplication is dismissed.’\n_________________\nL.O.\r\nBosielo\nJudge\r\nof Appeal\nWillis\r\nJA (partially concurring and partially dissenting):\n[13]\r\nI agree with the order that Bosielo JA has proposed. In my opinion,\r\nhowever, it is the aggregate of the following considerations\n–\r\nrather than any one of them taken on its own – that leads one\r\nto this conclusion: (a) the obviousness of the error\nof the decision\r\nof the high court; (b) the bad behaviour of the municipality,\r\nincluding the squandering of the of public funds\non needless\r\nlitigation and (c) the injustice of allowing the order of the high\r\ncourt to stand, with the appellant being mulcted\nin costs.\n_________________\nN.P.\r\nWillis\nJudge\r\nof Appeal\nAppearances:\nFor\r\nAppellant        :        \r\nJ G Bergenthuin SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nBernhard\r\nVan der Hoven Attorneys; Pretoria\nRosendorff\r\nReitz Barry, Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent    :        \r\nJ A Motsepe (with him M H Mphahlele)\nInstructed\r\nby:\nMalesa\r\nAttorneys; Pretoria\nMpobole\r\n& Ismael Attorneys, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, LE THOM (Pty) Ltd, owns property at 15 Von Wielligh Street, Phalaborwa. In 2012 the property flooded because storm‑water runoff was blocked by over‑grown vegetation on municipal land. The High Court ordered the municipality to remove the blockage, construct a subsurface drainage system and bear the costs. The municipality failed to comply, and the appellant engaged Rimiro Construction to carry out the remedial work in October 2013. In March 2014 the municipality sent its service provider, Mame Projects, to the site, alleging the appellant had erected a fence that prevented access and seeking an order to demolish the fence and grant access through the appellant’s land, claiming it was the only viable access point. The appellant denied this, asserting alternative access routes existed. The High Court, despite the genuine factual dispute, granted the municipality’s application on 20 May 2014.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the High Court erred in granting final relief by way of a motion despite a serious dispute of fact concerning the alleged sole access point. 2. Whether the appeal was moot because the remedial work ordered in 2012 had already been completed. 3. Whether an order granting the municipality access would have any practical effect. 4. Allocation of costs given the circumstances.",
    "principles": "The court applied the principle that a party who proceeds by way of notice of motion while anticipating a dispute of essential facts does so at its own risk (Tamarillo v Aitken; Room Hire Co v Jeppe Street Mansions). Where facts are genuinely contested, the matter should be referred to trial or oral evidence. Section 16(2)(a)(i) of the Superior Courts Act allows dismissal of an appeal where the decision sought would have no practical effect. Precedents such as Tecmed Africa v Minister of Health and Rand Water Board v Rotek Industries reaffirm that courts should not issue academic orders with no real consequence.",
    "application": "The SCA held that the High Court should have referred the access‑point dispute to a hearing of oral evidence or trial and therefore erred in granting the order. It further found that, by the time of the appeal, both parties confirmed that the remedial work had been completed, rendering any order to compel access moot and academic under s 16(2)(a)(i). Consequently, the appeal was dismissed on the ground of no practical effect, and the High Court’s order was set aside. Regarding costs, the court concluded that both parties were equally at fault for not informing the court of the completed work and each should bear its own costs.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld; the High Court’s order granting the municipality access was set aside and the application was dismissed. Each party was ordered to bear its own costs in both the High Court and the appeal."
