two\r\ncounsel.\nJUDGMENT\nMeyer\r\nAJA (\nPonnan, Maya and Petse JJA and Van der\r\nMerwe\nAJA concurring)\n[1] The respondent, the\r\nCommissioner for the South African Revenue Service (SARS), was\r\ngranted leave to institute winding-up proceedings\nagainst the\r\nappellant, Miles Plant Hire (Pty) Ltd (Miles), and Miles was placed\r\nunder final winding-up by an order of the Gauteng\nDivision of the\r\nHigh Court, Pretoria (Van Niekerk AJ) on 3 October 2013.  Leave\r\nto appeal to this court was granted by the\ncourt a quo on 12 February\r\n2014.  Miles lodged its notice of appeal with the registrar of\r\nthis court on 11 March 2014. \nThe appeal thereafter lapsed for\r\nfailure on the part of Miles to timeously prosecute it further. \r\nTherefore, the preliminary\nquestion that is before us is whether the\r\nnon-compliance with the rules of this court should be condoned and\r\nthe appeal reinstated. \nI propose first to deal with the factual\r\nbackground against which the appeal arose and lapsed.\n[2] Miles commenced\r\ntrading in the year 2000.  It conducted a plant hiring business\r\nand performed ‘contracting services\nin the construction and\r\nroad surfacing industry’.  Its sole director before it was\r\nfinally wound up had been Ms Melanie\nPandaram (Ms Pandaram).\n[3] Miles applied for and\r\nwas granted tax amnesty under the provisions of the\nSmall Business\nTax Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation Laws Act 9 of 2006\nin respect\r\nof the years preceding the 2006 year of assessment.  By her own\r\nadmission Ms Pandaram on behalf of Miles submitted\nto SARS an income\r\ntax return for the 2008 year of assessment as well as a VAT return\r\nfor the March 2008 tax period and supporting\ndocuments that were to\r\nher knowledge false.  Her fraudulent conduct caused Miles’\r\ntax liability to be reduced by R1\n740 508.77 and resulted in Miles\r\nostensibly being entitled to a refund of input tax in the sum of R840\r\n245.61.  Following\nthe conclusion of a plea and sentence\r\nagreement in terms of\ns 105A\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of\n1977\n, Ms Pandaram representing Miles was convicted by the Durban\r\nRegional Court of income tax evasion (contravening s 104(1)(a) of the\n\nIncome Tax Act 58 of 1962) and VAT evasion (contravening s 59(1) of\r\nthe Value Added Tax Act 89 of 1991) and she in her representative\n\ncapacity was sentenced on each count to a fine of R100 000.00, which\r\nwas wholly suspended for five years on certain conditions.\n[4] It is also undisputed\r\nthat Miles had a history of failing to pay taxes when they became due\r\nand it failed to submit income tax\nreturns for the 2010, 2011 and\r\n2012 tax years.  On 1 October 2012 Miles requested SARS to\r\nprovide it with an opportunity to\napply to SARS for a compromise of\r\nits outstanding tax debt in terms of Chapter 14 of the Tax\r\nAdministration Act 28 of 2011 (the\nTAA), which debt at that stage\r\namounted to R59 million.\n[5] On 25 October 2012\r\nwhen SARS was still awaiting Miles’ request for its tax debt to\r\nbe compromised, Miles obtained an order\nof the North Gauteng High\r\nCourt, Pretoria sanctioning a compromise of its financial\r\nobligations.  The compromise proposed\nby Ms Pandaram did not\r\ncontain all the information required in terms of s 155(3) of the 2008\r\nCompanies Act nor were the requirements\nprescribed by s 155(2) met.  \r\nSARS accordingly launched an urgent application for the setting aside\r\nof the s 155 sanctioned\ncompromise.  Miles did not oppose the\r\napplication and such order was granted on 4 December 2012.\n[6] SARS served on Miles\r\na demand dated 19 February 2013 in terms of s 345(1) of the Companies\r\nAct 61 of 1973 (the 1973 Companies\nAct) wherein Miles’\r\noutstanding tax debt was recorded to be the sum of R37 209 060.51\r\n(inclusive of penalties and interest).  \nIn terms of s\r\n172(1) of the TAA, SARS also filed with the Registrar of the\r\nKwazulu-Natal High Court, Durban a certified statement\nin which the\r\namount of tax due and payable by Miles was certified to be the sum of\r\nR37 441 091.55.  Section 174 of the TAA\nprovides that ‘[a]\r\ncertified statement filed under section 172 must be treated as a\r\ncivil judgment lawfully given in the\nrelevant court in favour of SARS\r\nfor a liquid debt for the amount specified in the statement.’\n[7] In response to the\r\nstatutory demand, SARS was requested to afford Miles a period of\r\nthree weeks to finalise and present to SARS\na request for its tax\r\ndebt to be compromised in accordance with the provisions of the TAA\r\nand not to proceed with the winding-up\nof Miles pending the outcome\r\nof the request.  It is also stated that Miles-\n‘\n.\r\n. . was in the position to offer SARS an amount of R12 million rand\r\nto be paid over a period of 18 months with interest calculated\non the\r\noutstanding balance . . . .‘\nand\n‘\n[s]hould\r\nthe offer of compromise be declined, then the company will invariably\r\nface financial ruin . . . .‘\n[8] A Chapter 14 TAA\r\ncompromise of Miles’ tax debt, however, did not materialise. \r\nMs Pandaram, who deposed to Miles’\nanswering affidavit in the\r\nwinding-up application, stated that:\n‘\nAs\r\nthe Respondent [Miles] was literally with its back against the wall\r\nand the liquidation not being an option that the Respondent\ncould\r\nconsider, the only viable avenue in terms of which the Respondent\r\ncould still attempt to negotiate with the Applicant [SARS],\nwere to\r\nplace the Respondent in Business Rescue.’\nOn 28 March 2013 Miles’\r\nboard (Ms Pandaram) passed a resolution in terms of\ns 129(1)\nof the\nCompanies Act 71 of 2008\nvoluntarily beginning business rescue\r\nproceedings and placing it under supervision.   The\r\nresolution took effect when\nit was filed with the Companies and\r\nIntellectual Property Commission (CIPC) on 2 April 2013.  A\r\nbusiness rescue practitioner,\nMr George Nell, was appointed on 4\r\nApril 2013.\n[9] SARS instituted the\r\napplication for the winding-up of Miles in the court a quo on 22\r\nApril 2013.  In terms of the notice\nof motion it also sought the\r\nsetting aside of Miles’ board resolution of 28 March 2013 to\r\nbegin business rescue proceedings\nand place the company under\r\nsupervision.  The business rescue proceedings, however, ended\r\nbefore the application was finally\nheard in the court a quo. \r\nThe business rescue practitioner concluded that there was no\r\nreasonable prospect for rescuing Miles\nand he accordingly filed a\r\nnotice of the termination of the business rescue proceedings with the\r\nCIPC in terms of\ns 132(2)(b)\non 4 June 2013.\n[10] One of the issues\r\nraised by Miles in resisting its winding-up was that SARS had failed\r\nto comply with the provisions of\ns 177\nof the TAA, which section\r\nreads as follows:\n‘\n(1)      \r\nSARS may institute proceedings for the sequestration, liquidation or\r\nwinding-up of a person\nfor an outstanding tax debt;\n(2)      \r\nSARS may institute the proceedings whether or not the person-\n(a) \r\nis present in the Republic; or\n(b) \r\nhas assets in the Republic.\n(3)      \r\nIf the tax debt is subject to an objection or appeal under Chapter 9\r\nor a further appeal\nagainst a decision by the tax court under\nsection\r\n129\n, the proceedings may only be instituted with leave of the court\r\nbefore which the proceedings are brought.’\nMiles’ tax debt was\r\nsubject to a pending appeal to the tax court at the time when the\r\nwinding-up proceedings were instituted.\n[11] The parties agreed\r\nthat the proper interpretation of\ns 177(3)\nof the TAA was the only\r\nissue that the court a quo needed to decide and that the fate of the\r\nwinding-up application depended solely\non the determination of that\r\nquestion of law. Miles contended that if the tax debt was subject to\r\nan objection or appeal as contemplated\nin\ns 177(3)\n, an application\r\nfor the winding-up of a company may only be instituted by SARS after\r\nit had been granted prior leave by the court\nbefore which the\r\nwinding-up proceedings are ultimately brought.  SARS, on the\r\nother hand, contended that the required leave\nand the winding-up of a\r\ncompany could legally be sought in the same application proceedings. \r\nFrom this it is clear, therefore,\nthat Miles had abandoned its\r\nopposition to the winding-up application and confined its argument to\r\nthe question of law.  (See\nDengetenge Holdings (Pty) Ltd v\r\nSouthern Sphere Mining and Development Company Ltd & others\n[2013] All SA 251\n(SCA);\n[2013] ZASCA 5\npara 17).  \r\nThe interpretation of\ns 177(3)\ncontended for by SARS found favour\r\nwith the court a quo.  On 3 October 2013 it granted SARS leave\r\nto institute the winding-up\nproceedings and it placed Miles under a\r\nfinal order of winding-up.\n[12] Against that\r\nbackdrop I turn to consider Miles’ condonation application. \r\nThe principles relating to condonation\nare well established.  They\r\nwere thus stated by this court in\nDengetenge\n:\n‘\n[11]\r\nFactors which usually weigh with this court in considering an\r\napplication for condonation include the degree of non-compliance,\nthe\r\nexplanation therefor, the importance of the case, a respondent’s\r\ninterest in the finality of the judgment of the court\nbelow, the\r\nconvenience of this court and the avoidance of unnecessary delay in\r\nthe administration of justice (per Holmes JA in\nFederated\r\nEmployers Fire & General Insurance Company Limited\n& another v McKenzie\n1969\r\n(3) SA 360\n(A) at 362F-G). . .\n[12]\r\nIn\nUitenhage Transitional Local Council v South African Revenue\r\nService\n2004 (1) SA 292\n(SCA) at paragraph 6 this Court stated:\n“\nOne\r\nwould have hoped that the many admonitions concerning what is\r\nrequired of an applicant in a condonation application would be\ntrite\r\nknowledge among practitioners who are entrusted with the preparation\r\nof appeals to this Court: condonation is not to be had\nmerely for the\r\nasking; a full, detailed and accurate account of the causes of the\r\ndelay and their effects must be furnished so\nas to enable the Court\r\nto understand clearly the reasons and to assess the responsibility.\r\nIt must be obvious that, if the non-compliance\nis time-related then\r\nthe date, duration and extent of any obstacle on which reliance is\r\nplaced must be spelled out.”\n[13]\r\nWhat calls for some acceptable explanation is not only the delay in\r\nthe filing of the heads of argument, but also the delay\nin seeking\r\ncondonation. An appellant should, whenever it realises that it has\r\nnot complied with a rule of court, apply for condonation\nwithout\r\ndelay (\nCommissioner for Inland Revenue v\r\nBurger\n1956 (4) SA 446\n(A) at\r\n449G-H).’\n[13]\r\nThe notice of appeal in this matter was lodged with the registrar of\r\nthis court on 11 March 2014, which was within the one\nmonth period of\r\nthe granting of leave to appeal as required in terms of SCA\nrule\r\n7(1)(b).\nMiles failed to lodge the record of the proceedings in\r\nthe court a quo with the registrar of this court within three months\n\nof the lodging of its notice of appeal as required in terms of SCA\nrule 8(1)\nand the time limit for lodging the record had not been\r\nextended in terms of SCA\nrule 8(2).\nSCA\nrule 8(3)\nprovides that\r\n‘[i]f the appellant fails to lodge the record within the\r\nprescribed period or within the extended period, the\nappeal shall\r\nlapse’.  Miles only lodged the record, its heads of\r\nargument and an application for reinstatement of the\nappeal and\r\ncondonation with the registrar of this court on 18 August 2014. \r\nThe record should have been lodged on or before\n10 June 2014 and\r\nMiles’ heads of argument, according to SCA\nrule 10(1)(a)\n,\r\nwithin six weeks of the lodging of the record.  SCA\nrule\r\n10(2A)\n(a)\nprovides that if an ‘appellant fails to lodge heads of argument\r\nwithin the prescribed period or within the extended period,\nthe\r\nappeal shall lapse’.  Furthermore, a decision on appeal in\r\nthis matter hinges exclusively on a matter of law. \nYet, Miles\r\nlodged a voluminous record with the registrar without first seeking\r\nthe consent of SARS to limit the record and to omit\nthe unnecessary\r\nparts from it as is required in terms of SCA\nrule 8(9)\nor, at the\r\nvery least, to prepare a core bundle of documents as is required in\r\nterms of SCA\nrule 8(7)\n, which would have been appropriate to the\r\nappeal.\n[14] There are several\r\nunsatisfactory features about this matter.  Miles did not file a\r\nreplying affidavit in the condonation\napplication and left various\r\nmatters raised in SARS’ answering affidavit that obviously\r\ncalled for an answer unchallenged,\nsuch as that:\n-          \r\nMiles ‘attempted to defraud the fiscus by fraudulently\r\nobtaining’\nthe compromise in terms of s 155 of the 2008\nCompanies Act, that\nthe court when sanctioning the compromise was\r\n‘misled’, that the true facts were ‘fraudulently\r\nmisrepresented’\nor ‘not disclosed’, and that ‘the\r\nex parte order was obtained on a\nmala fide\nbasis;\n-          \r\nthe grounds of objection against certain assessments raised by SARS\n\n‘do not disclose a defence’;\n-          \r\nit was inappropriate to commence the business rescue proceedings\r\ntaking\ninto account the insolvency of Miles;\n-          \r\n‘the only reason why [Miles] applied for leave to appeal was\nin\r\nan attempt to delay the winding-up’ and it ‘is utilizing\r\nthe pending appeal as a means to avoid [Miles] being liquidated\nin\r\ncircumstances wherein it is hopelessly insolvent’;\n-          \r\nthe ‘appeal like the compromise and the business rescue\r\nproceedings\nwere only instituted as a mechanism to bring about delay\r\nand/or avoid the winding up of [Miles]’;\n-          \r\n‘the reason why Mrs Pandaram failed to prosecute this appeal\n\ntimeously is because the pending appeal was merely used as a\r\nstratagem to attempt to prevent the liquidation process proceeding,\n\nspecifically insofar as the sale of assets is concerned’;\n-          \r\nand that ‘the only reason why the appeal has been reinstated\nis\r\nto frustrate the winding-up process’.\n[15] Miles seeks to\r\nattribute the causes of delay to:  (a) the fact that its\r\nattorneys of record (Symington & De Kok, Bloemfontein\nand Leahy &\r\nVan Niekerk Inc, Pretoria (Miles’ erstwhile attorneys))\r\nwithdrew on or about 9 May 2014;  (b) Ms Pandaram’s\nbelief\r\nthat the liquidators attended to the prosecution of the appeal and\r\nthat she only became aware on 5 June 2014 that they were\nnot; \r\nand (c)  that her present attorneys of record, Yugan Naidu\r\nAttorneys (Miles’ present attorneys) ‘were\ntrying to\r\nreconstruct the record’, but were notified on 25 July 2014 that\r\nthe court file could not be located whereafter\nthey obtained the\r\nrecord from the liquidators’ attorneys, Tintingers Inc (the\r\nliquidators’ attorneys), on 1 August\n2014.\n[16]\r\nMiles was neither represented by its liquidators in the appeal nor in\r\nthe application for condonation, but by Ms Pandaram. \nShe\r\ninstructed Miles’ erstwhile attorneys of record.  On 11\r\nApril 2014 they withdrew as its attorneys of record. \n  On\r\n12 June 2014, which is two months after their withdrawal, the\r\nregistrar of this court was advised by Mr Yugan Naidu\nthat he had\r\nbeen appointed as the attorney of record for Miles.  Ms Pandaram\r\nattempts to explain the failure to properly prosecute\nthe appeal\r\nsince the withdrawal of Miles’ erstwhile attorneys by stating\r\nthat she, until 5 June 2014, believed that the ‘liquidators\n\nwould be attending’ to the prosecution of the appeal.  In\r\nthis regard she states:\n‘\nIt\r\nappears from an email dated the 4\nth\nJune 2014 that the liquidators unequivocally had no intent of having\r\nanything to do with the prosecution of the appeal, despite\ntheir\r\ninitial indications to the contrary.  In this email my present\r\nattorneys were advised that the liquidators were not\nparties to the\r\nappeal, and were advised further that the liquidators were appointed\r\nby the Master of the High Court to attend to\nthe administration of\r\nthe estate, which they intended to do, save for the realisation of\r\nassets until the appeal has either been\nfinalised or lapsed.  Be\r\nthat as it may, I accordingly became aware on the 5\nth\nJune 2014 that I would be required to prosecute the appeal if I so\r\ndeemed appropriate.’\n[17] Ms Pandaram,\r\nhowever, fails to disclose what the ‘initial indications’\r\nfrom the liquidators were that allegedly\nled her to believe that they\r\nwould be prosecuting the appeal nor does she disclose any other basis\r\nfor her alleged belief. SARS\npertinently took issue with this aspect\r\nof her explanation in its answering affidavit but she did not reply. \r\nMs Pandaram\ncould, on the facts presented, hardly have believed that\r\nthe liquidators would be attending to the prosecution of the appeal.\n[18]\r\nFurthermore, with reference to an exchange of correspondence and a\r\nprevious inconsistent statement made by Ms Pandaram under\noath, SARS\r\nhas demonstrated the falsity of Ms Pandaram’s allegation that\r\nshe only became aware on 5 June 2014 that she would\nbe required to\r\nprosecute the appeal.  Two weeks earlier, on 21 May 2014, Miles’\r\npresent attorneys wrote to the liquidators:\n‘\nWe\r\nare instructed by the director and creditors to prosecute the appeal\r\nand in so doing, have secured fees to proceed with the appeal.\nWe\r\nare instructed that our clients shall indemnify the estate for any\r\nliability for fees and which in essence will not expose or\nprejudice\r\nthe estate for costs at all.\nPlease\r\nrevert with a consent for us to proceed with the Appeal on the\r\naforementioned terms.’\nMs\r\nPandaram deposed to the founding affidavit in an urgent application\r\nthat was launched in the Gauteng Division, Pretoria on 1\nJuly 2014 in\r\nwhich an order was unsuccessfully sought against Miles’\r\nliquidators and the magistrate presiding at an enquiry\nin terms of s\r\n415 of the 1973\nCompanies Act to\ninterdict the continuation of the\r\nenquiry.  In that affidavit Ms Pandaram stated that it had been\r\nher understanding that the\nliquidators-\n‘\n.\r\n. . would prosecute the appeal to finalisation thereof, but they have\r\ndeclined to do so and have advised those representing [her]\nof their\r\nintentions only on or about the 21\nst\nMay 2014.’\n[19]\r\nMs Pandaram also states that her present attorneys, who ‘were\r\ntrying to reconstruct the record’, were advised on\n25 July 2014\r\n(presumably by their correspondent attorneys in Pretoria) that they-\n‘\n.\r\n. . have been unable to obtain the Court File under case number\r\n23533/2013, and wish to advise that the only other possible way\nof\r\nobtaining the required copies of the papers, will be to enquire from\r\nthe Applicant’s Attorneys to make copies available.’\nMiles’ present\r\nattorneys then obtained the record from the liquidators’\r\nattorneys on 1 August 2014.  Miles failed\nto proffer any\r\nexplanation for the delay in obtaining the record from the time of\r\nthe appointment of its present attorneys until\n25 July 2014. \r\nAnd there is yet another gap in the chronological sequence advanced\r\nby Miles:  no explanation is given\nfor the delay from 1 August\r\n2014 when the record was obtained until 18 August 2014 when it was\r\nlodged with the registrar of this\ncourt.  The same holds true\r\nfor the late filing of its heads of argument.\n[20] No acceptable\r\nexplanation is given why condonation was not applied for without\r\ndelay.  Furthermore, no attempt is even\nmade to explain Miles’\r\nfailure to seek the consent of SARS to limit the record before the\r\nvoluminous record was lodged with\nthe registrar of this court or for\r\nits failure to have prepared a core bundle of documents. \r\nMatters that called for an explanation\nhave simply not been explained\r\nand the explanation that is proffered lacks credence and is sorely\r\nwanting.\n[21] I now turn to SARS’\r\ninterest in the finality of the judgment of the court a quo. \r\nThe process of Miles’ liquidation\ncommenced once the winding-up\r\norder had been granted on 3 October 2013.  The operation of the\r\norder remained in force despite\nthe court a quo having granted Miles\r\nleave to appeal on 12 February 2014;  it was wound-up on the\r\nground that it was unable\nto pay its debts.  (See:\nExpress\r\nModel Trading 289 CC v Dolphin Ridge Body Corporate\n[2014] 2 All\r\nSA 513\n(SCA);\n[2014] ZASCA 17\npara 18).  In this case the\r\nfinding that Miles was unable to pay its debts has not been\r\nassailed.  The liquidators of\nMiles took control of its affairs\r\nand have taken steps in its winding-up, including the enquiry in\r\nterms of s 415 of the 1973\nCompanies Act and\nthe realisation of\r\ncertain of its assets, movable and immovable, once the appeal had\r\nlapsed.  It is undisputed that the winding-up\nis presently at an\r\nadvanced stage.\n[22]\r\nFaced with similar circumstances in\nDolphin Ridge\n, para 18,\r\nwhere the winding-up had progressed apace, Ponnan JA expressed the\r\nview that it may indeed prove impossible to turn back\nthe clock and\r\nthat it may thus be arguable that the appeal has become academic, but\r\nhe considered it not necessary ‘to go\nthat far’.\nT\nhere is no need for me to go that far either.  No\r\ninformation was placed before us to show that Miles’ dire\r\nfinancial\nposition has improved since the winding-up order had been\r\nissued.  On the contrary, the uncontradicted statement of SARS\r\nin\nits answering affidavit is that should Miles succeed-\n‘\n.\r\n. . the result would be that [SARS] would have to bring another\r\napplication which will lead to [Miles] being liquidated as it\nis\r\nhopelessly insolvent.  The result will merely serve to further\r\nprejudice the creditors, of which [SARS] is the biggest\ncreditor.’\nBusiness rescue\r\nproceedings, on Ms Pandaram’s own version, were the ‘only\r\nviable avenue’ for Miles when faced\nwith the threat of\r\nliquidation, but that too failed.\n[23] I need not deal with\r\nMiles’ prospects of success on appeal in relation to the\r\ninterpretation of\ns 177\nof the TAA.  The facts of this case show\r\nflagrant breaches of the rules of this court without any acceptable\r\nexplanation therefor. \nThe cumulative effect of these factors\r\ncoupled with SARS’ interest in the finality of the court a\r\nquo’s judgment and\nthe evident prejudice to SARS and the body\r\nof creditors, is such that condonation should be refused irrespective\r\nof the prospects\nof success on appeal.  In\nThe Commissioner\r\nfor the South African Revenue Service v Candice-Jean van der Merwe\n[2015] ZASCA 86\npara 19 this court stated:\n‘\nIn\r\napplications of this sort the prospects of success are in general an\r\nimportant, although not decisive, consideration.  It\nhas been\r\npointed out\n(Finbro Furnishers (Pty) Ltd\r\nv Registrar of Deeds, Bloemfontein\n[1985]\r\nZASCA 71\n;\n1985 (4) SA 773\n(A) at 789C) that the court is bound to\r\nmake an assessment of an applicant’s prospects of success as\r\none of the factors relevant\nto the exercise of its discretion, unless\r\nthe cumulative effect of the other relevant factors in the case is\r\nsuch as to render\nthe application for condonation obviously unworthy\r\nof consideration. . . . This court has often said that in cases of\r\nflagrant\nbreaches of the rules, especially where there is no\r\nacceptable explanation therefor, the indulgence of condonation may be\r\nrefused\nwhatever the merits of the appeal.  This applies even\r\nwhere the blame lies solely with the attorney.’\n(Footnotes omitted)\n[24] Finally the matter\r\nof costs.  SARS seeks a punitive costs order\nde bonis\r\npropriis\nagainst Ms Pandaram.  I am of the view that an\r\naward of costs against her personally on the scale as between\r\nattorney and\nclient is warranted and appropriate in the circumstances\r\nof this case.  Ms Pandaram is the person who represented Miles\r\nin\nthe appeal and in the application for condonation.  The\r\nliquidators were given the assurance that Miles’ estate would\n\nnot be exposed to any costs.  Ms Pandaram has shown a general\r\nlack of candour and has played loose and fast with the rules\nof our\r\ncourts.  There is no justifiable reason why the body of\r\ncreditors should financially be prejudiced as a result of this\n\nlitigation.  Moreover, SARS has been put through the unnecessary\r\ntrouble from defending a judgment from the high court in\nits favour. \r\nThere seems to be no reason for compliant taxpayers to be saddled\r\nwith those costs.\n[25]\r\nIn the result:\n(a)      \r\nThe application for condonation is dismissed.\n(b)      \r\nMs Melanie Pandaram is ordered to pay the respondent’s costs of\r\nthe application for\ncondonation and its costs incurred in opposing\r\nthe lapsed appeal\nde bonis propriis\non\r\nthe attorney and client scale, which costs in both instances shall\r\ninclude those of two counsel.\n___________________\nPA\r\nMeyer\nActing\r\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFor\r\nAppellant:                                          \n\nGD Wickins\nInstructed\r\nby:                                             \n\nYugan Naidu Attorneys, Durban\nC/o Honey Attorneys\nBloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent:                                       \n\nE Coetzee SC with L Sigogo\nInstructed\r\nby:                                             \n\nEdelstein-Bosman Inc., Pretoria\nC/o McIntyre & Van\r\nder Post Attorneys\nBloemfontein",

    "facts": "Miles Plant Hire (Pty) Ltd (Miles), a plant‑hiring company founded in 2000 and directed by Ms Melanie Pandaram, repeatedly failed to meet its tax obligations. The company obtained a tax amnesty but subsequently submitted false income‑tax and VAT returns for 2008, reducing its tax liability by R1,740,508.77 and claiming a R840,245.61 input‑tax refund. Ms Pandaram was convicted of tax evasion and fined. Miles accrued a large tax debt – approximately R59 million – and unsuccessfully attempted a compromise and a business‑rescue process in 2013. SARS instituted winding‑up proceedings, which the High Court upheld on 3 October 2013, placing Miles under a final winding‑up order. Miles appealed the decision; the notice of appeal was filed on time (11 March 2014) but the record and heads of argument were not lodged within the prescribed periods, causing the appeal to lapse. Miles later applied for condonation to have the appeal reinstated.",
    "issues": "The primary issue was whether the court should grant condonation and reinstate Miles’ lapsed appeal despite the appellant’s failure to comply with the Supreme Court of Appeal’s procedural rules. A subsidiary issue concerned the relevance of the respondent’s interest in the finality of the winding‑up judgment and the prejudice to creditors.",
    "principles": "The court applied established principles governing condonation applications: the degree of non‑compliance, the adequacy of the explanation, the importance of the case, the respondent’s interest in finality, the convenience of the court and avoidance of unnecessary delay (Dengetenge; Uitenhage Trans‑Local Council v SARS; Commissioner for Inland Revenue v Burger). It reiterated that flagrant breaches of court rules without a satisfactory explanation may justify refusal of condonation, even where the appeal may have merit, and that the court must assess the applicant’s prospects of success but can reject a condonation where other factors overwhelmingly oppose it.",
    "application": "The court found that Miles repeatedly breached SCA rules: it failed to file the record within the required three‑month period, lodged heads of argument late, did not seek SARS’s consent to limit the voluminous record, and provided an unconvincing and inconsistent explanation for the delays, blaming withdrawn attorneys and a mistaken belief that liquidators would prosecute the appeal. The court deemed these explanations unsatisfactory and noted the cumulative effect of the breaches, SARS’s interest in the finality of the winding‑up, and the prejudice to the body of creditors. Accordingly, the court concluded that condonation should be refused irrespective of any potential success on the merits of the appeal.",
    "conclusion": "The application for condonation was dismissed. Ms Melanie Pandaram was ordered to pay the respondent’s costs of the condonation application and the costs incurred in opposing the lapsed appeal, on the attorney‑and‑client scale, including fees for two counsel, de bonis propriis."
