The appeal is with leave\nof the high court.\n[2]\r\nIt is common cause that the appellant has a liquidated claim against\r\nthe respondents. As at 26 August 2011 their indebtedness\nto the\r\nappellant amounted to R953 903.48 plus interest thereon at the rate\r\nof 7.30 per cent per annum. The indebtedness arose as\na result of an\r\noverdraft facility the appellant had granted to the respondents\r\npursuant to the conclusion of a written loan agreement\non 7 August\r\n2006. The facility was subsequently increased. The moneys borrowed\r\nfrom the appellant were secured by a first and a\nsecond mortgage bond\r\nregistered in favour of the appellant over an immovable property\r\nowned by the respondents and in which they\nreside. The National\r\nCredit Act 34 of 2005 (the NCA) applies to the loan agreement. The\r\nappellant is a ‘credit provider’\nand each respondent a\r\n‘consumer’ as contemplated in s 1 of the NCA.\n[3]\r\nDuring the year 2008 the respondents applied to a registered debt\r\ncounsellor, Mr Rael Zimmerman, for a debt review in terms\nof s 86(1)\r\nof the NCA.  They submitted an application, as required in terms\r\nof reg 24(1)(a) read with Form 16 of the regulations\npromulgated in\r\nGN R489,\nGG\n28864, 31 May 2006 (the NCA regulations) to the\r\ndebt counsellor.  The debt counsellor dispatched notices dated\r\n25 July 2008\nin accordance with s 86(4)(\nb\n) read with reg 24(2)\r\nand Form 17.1 to credit bureaux and the respondents’ credit\r\nproviders that were listed in their application,\nadvising them that\r\nthe respondents have applied for debt review in terms of s 86 of the\r\nNCA.  He conducted an assessment in\nterms of s 86(6) and\r\nconcluded that the respondents were over-indebted.  He\r\nthereafter sent further notices dated 3 September\n2008 in accordance\r\nwith reg 24(10) and Form 17.2 to credit bureaux and the respondents’\r\ncredit providers advising them that\nthe respondents’\r\napplication for debt review had been successful and that their debt\r\nobligations were being restructured.\n[4]\r\nThe proposal which the debt counsellor made to the respondents’\r\ncredit providers, including the appellant, reflects a\nsubstantial\r\nmonthly shortage of their income over their expenditure.  The\r\ndebt counsellor recommended that the period for\npayment in respect of\r\neach credit agreement be extended and that the monthly payments be\r\nreduced accordingly.  He also recommended\nthat the interest\r\naccruing on the debt owed to the appellant be reduced to a rate of 5\r\nper cent per annum.  Interest reductions\nin respect of other\r\ndebts were also recommended.  The appellant was one of the\r\ncredit providers which did not consent to the\ndebt counsellor’s\r\nproposal.\n[5]\r\nThe debt re-arrangement order proposed was put before the\r\nMagistrate’s Court, Alberton, in terms of s 86(7), read with\nss\r\n87 and 79 of the NCA, by means of a substantive application.  BMW\r\nFinancial Services (SA) (Pty) Ltd and the appellant opposed\nthe\r\napplication. On 20 August 2009 the magistrates’ court issued an\r\norder declaring the respondents to be over-indebted and\nre-arranging\r\ntheir obligations in accordance with the debt re-arrangement proposed\r\nby the debt counsellor. (Whether the reduction\nin contractually\r\nagreed interest rates renders the debt re-arrangement order invalid\r\nas contended for by the appellant is a matter\nthat needs not be\r\ndecided in this matter.) The respondents failed to effect proper and\r\npunctual payment to the appellant of the\nreduced monthly instalments\r\ndue to it in terms of the debt re-arrangement order.\n[6]\r\nBecause the respondents were in default under the loan agreement and\r\nwith their obligations in terms of the debt re-arrangement\norder, the\r\nappellant adopted the stance that it was entitled to enforce its\r\nrights and securities under the loan agreement and\nmortgage bonds in\r\nterms of s 88(3) of the NCA.  Section 88(3) reads as follows:\n‘\nSubject\r\nto section 86(9) and (10), a credit provider who receives notice of\r\ncourt proceedings contemplated in section 83 or 85,\nor notice in\r\nterms of section 86(4)(b)(i), may not exercise or enforce by\r\nlitigation or other judicial process any right or security\nunder that\r\ncredit agreement until-\n(a)\r\nthe consumer is in default under the credit agreement;\nand\n(b) one of the\r\nfollowing has occurred:\n(i)\r\nAn event contemplated in subsection (1) (\na\n) through (\nc\n);\r\nor\n(ii) the consumer\r\ndefaults on any obligation in terms of a re-arrangement agreed\r\nbetween the consumer and credit providers, or ordered\nby a court or\r\nthe Tribunal.’\n(Section\r\n86(4)(\nb\n)(i) referred to in s 88(3), read with reg 24(2) and\r\nForm 17.1, enjoins a debt counsellor to notify all credit providers\r\nlisted\nin a consumer’s application that the consumer has\r\napplied for debt review in terms of s 86 of the NCA. The references\r\nin\ns 88(3) to other provisions of the NCA are not presently\r\nrelevant.)\n[7]\r\nThe appellant accordingly instituted an action against the\r\nrespondents in the North Gauteng High Court on 20 January 2011\r\nclaiming\npayment of the sum of R923 911.72, interest thereon at the\r\nrate of 7.30 per cent per annum from 1 January 2011, an order\r\ndeclaring\nthe immovable property executable and costs on the scale as\r\nbetween attorney and client.  The action was defended and the\r\nrespondents successfully resisted summary judgment.\n[8]\r\nOn 5 March 2012 the appellant launched an application for the\r\nsequestration of the respondents’ joint estate. It relied\non\r\nthe outstanding indebtedness as at 26 August 2011 of R953 903.48 and\r\ninterest thereon at the rate of 7.30 per cent per annum. \nThe\r\nrespondents opposed the sequestration application, and answering and\r\nreplying affidavits were exchanged.   On 5 August\n2013 the\r\nopposed application for the provisional sequestration of the\r\nrespondents’ joint estate was heard by Van Oosten J. \nHis\r\njudgment was delivered on 8 August 2013.  He issued an order\r\nprovisionally sequestrating the respondents’ joint\nestate and a\r\nrule nisi calling upon the respondents and all other interested\r\nparties to show cause on the return day why the provisional\norder\r\nshould not be confirmed.\n[9]\r\nOn 19 September 2013 the respondents launched an interlocutory\r\napplication in which they sought to set aside the provisional\norder. \r\nThe appellant filed an affidavit in opposition to this application. I\r\nneed not express any view on this somewhat unusual\nprocedure that was\r\nadopted. It was not objected to by the appellant. On 7 March 2014\r\nPhatudi J made an order setting aside the\nprovisional order,\r\ndischarged the rule nisi and ordered the appellant to pay the\r\nrespondents’ costs.\n[10]\r\nIn setting aside the provisional sequestration order the high court\r\nheld that an application by a credit provider for the sequestration\n\nof a consumer’s estate constitutes ‘other judicial\r\nprocess’ in terms of s 88(3) of the NCA by which the credit\n\nprovider exercises or enforces a right under the credit agreement\r\nbetween itself and the consumer.  The words ‘other\n\njudicial process’, so the high court held, mean ‘any\r\nmotion proceedings including sequestration applications’. \n\nThe high court also inferred from the appellant’s ‘papers\r\nand submissions made’ that it ‘opted to pursue\nthe\r\nrecovery of the debt by way of insolvency proceedings’. \r\nThe high court further held that a debt re-arrangement\norder\r\ncontemplated in s 86(7)(c)(ii) of the NCA, unless and until set aside\r\nby a competent court, constitutes a bar to the compulsory\n\nsequestration of a consumer’s estate.\n[11]\r\nThe appellant’s purpose in applying for the sequestration of\r\nthe respondents’ estate may well have been to obtain\npayment of\r\nits debt.  However, Solomon JA said this in\nEstate Logie v\r\nPriest\n1926 AD 312\nat 319:\n‘\nIt\r\nappears to me that it is perfectly legitimate for a creditor to take\r\ninsolvency proceedings against a debtor for the purpose\nof obtaining\r\npayment of his debt.  In truth that is the motive by which\r\npersons, as a rule are actuated in claiming sequestration\norders. \r\nThey are not influenced by altruistic considerations or regard for\r\nthe benefit of other creditors, who are able to\nlook after\r\nthemselves.  What they want is payment of their debt, or as much\r\nof it as they can get.’\nA\r\ncredit provider’s motive is irrelevant to the question whether\r\nsequestration proceedings are proceedings to ‘exercise\nor\r\nenforce by litigation or other judicial process any right or\r\nsecurity’ as characterized by s 88(3) of the NCA.  (See\nInvestec Bank Ltd & another v Mutemeri & another\n2010\r\n(1) SA 265\n(GSJ) paras 27-28;\nFirstrand Bank Ltd v Evans\n2011 (4) SA 597\n(KZD) paras 23-24.)\n[12]\r\nIn\nNaidoo v ABSA Bank Ltd\n2010 (4) SA 597\n(SCA) para 4 this\r\ncourt held ‘that sequestration proceedings are not in and of\r\nthemselves “legal proceedings to enforce\nthe agreement”\r\nwithin the meaning of s 129(1)(\nb\n)’. In this regard\r\nCachalia JA said the following:\n‘\nMr\r\nReddy's submission, as I understand it, implicitly contains a\r\nconcession that sequestration proceedings are not in and of\r\nthemselves\n“legal proceedings to enforce the agreement”\r\nwithin the meaning of s 129(1)(\nb\n). That his concession is\r\ncorrect is clear from the recent judgment in\nInvestec Bank Ltd and\r\nAnother v Mutemeri and Another\n, where Trengove AJ concluded that\r\nan order for the sequestration of a debtor's estate is not an order\r\nfor the enforcement of the\nsequestrating creditor's claim, and\r\nsequestration is thus not a legal proceeding to enforce an\r\nagreement.  He did so after\ncarefully considering the\r\nauthorities which have held that – “sequestration\r\nproceedings are instituted by a creditor\nagainst a debtor not for the\r\npurpose of claiming something from the latter, but for the purpose of\r\nsetting the machinery of the\nlaw in motion to have the debtor\r\ndeclared insolvent” - they are not proceedings “for the\r\nrecovery of a debt”. \nThe learned judge's reasoning\r\naccords with this court's description of a sequestration order as a\r\nspecies of execution, affecting\nnot only the rights of the two\r\nlitigants, but also of third parties, and involves the distribution\r\nof the insolvent's property\nto various creditors, while restricting\r\nthose creditors' ordinary remedies and imposing disabilities on the\r\ninsolvent - it is not\nan ordinary judgment entitling a creditor to\r\nexecute against a debtor.’\n(Footnotes\r\nare omitted.)\n[13]\r\nThe same reasoning, as was pointed out by Wallis J in\nEvans\n,\r\npara 25-\n‘\n.\r\n. . also led Trengove AJ to conclude that sequestration proceedings\r\nare not proceedings “in respect of a credit agreement”\n\nwithin the meaning of s 130(3) of the Act, or an endeavour to\r\nexercise or enforce by litigation or other judicial process any right\n\nor security under the credit agreement as referred to in s 88(3) of\r\nthe NCA.’\nWallis\r\nJ, bound to accept the authority and the binding force of a decision\r\nof this court as he was, followed these conclusions\nand the reasoning\r\nby which they were arrived at and added-\n‘\n. . . that it\r\navoids what would otherwise be the very odd conclusion, that the NCA\r\noperates to preclude credit providers from sequestrating\nthe estates\r\nof their debtors, but does not prevent other creditors from doing\r\nso.  If sequestration of a person's estate,\nwhile they are under\r\ndebt review, was to be rendered impermissible, there appears to be no\r\nsound reason why it should be available\nto creditors who are not\r\ncredit providers under the NCA. Conversely, there is no obvious\r\nreason why credit providers should be\na class of creditor excluded\r\nfrom invoking the mechanisms of the Insolvency Act.’\n[14]\r\nI conclude, therefore, that an application by a credit provider for\r\nthe sequestration of a consumer’s estate in which\nit relies on\r\nits claim in terms of a credit agreement to qualify as a creditor for\r\nthe purpose of instituting sequestration proceedings\ndoes not\r\nconstitute ‘litigation or other judicial process’ by\r\nwhich the credit provider exercises or enforces any right\nor security\r\nunder the credit agreement within the meaning of s 88(3) of the NCA. \r\nAn application for the sequestration of\na consumer’s estate is\r\nthus not precluded by the prohibition on the institution of\r\nproceedings envisaged in s 88(3) of the\nNCA.\n[15]\r\nRecognizing that the provisions of s 88(3) constitute no bar to the\r\ninstitution of sequestration proceedings implies further\nthat the\r\nexistence or validity of a debt re-arrangement order is immaterial to\r\nan application for sequestration of the consumer’s\nestate,\r\nunless the debt re-arrangement order is raised as a circumstance for\r\nthe court to exercise its discretion in favour of\nthe debtor. \r\n(See\nEvans\n, paras 29-37.)  Circumstances that would have\r\njustified the high court to have exercised the discretion vested in\r\nit in terms\nof\ns 12(1)\nof the\nInsolvency Act 24 of 1936\nin favour of\r\nthe respondents are absent. There is no evidence that establishes\r\nthat the respondents’ debts would be paid\nwithin a reasonable\r\ntime.  On the contrary, the evidence shows that the respondents\r\ndid not comply with the terms of the debt\nre-arrangement order and\r\nthat the payments made to the appellants in terms of that order did\r\nnot even discharge the monthly interest\naccruing on the debt.\n[16]\r\nFinally, I consider it necessary to express a view on the high\r\ncourt’s conclusion that a debt re-arrangement order\r\ncontemplated\nin\ns 86(7)(c)(ii)\nof the NCA constitutes a bar to the\r\ncompulsory sequestration of a consumer’s estate, unless and\r\nuntil set aside by a competent\ncourt.  That conclusion is\r\npremised on the erroneous finding that an application for\r\nsequestration seeks to enforce the credit\nagreement, and is in\r\nconflict with this court’s interpretation in\nNaidoo\n. \r\nIt misconstrues the nature and effect of a debt re-arrangement\r\norder.\n[17]\r\nAs was said by Wallis J in\nEvans\n, para 35-\n‘\n[t]he effect\r\nof a debt re-arrangement order is to place a moratorium on credit\r\nproviders pursuing their contractual remedies, for\nso long as the\r\ndebtor complies with the terms of the debt re-arrangement order. Once\r\nit is recognised that an application for sequestration\nis not the\r\nenforcement of the credit agreement, it must follow that any\r\nmoratorium to claiming payment, under the credit agreement\nthat\r\nexists by virtue of a debt re-arrangement order, is not a bar to the\r\ngrant of a sequestration order.’\n[18]\r\nThe moratorium is lifted by operation of law - and accordingly\r\nwithout the need to have the debt re-arrangement order set aside\n-\r\nonce the consumer is in default of the relevant credit agreement and\r\nis in default of the debt re-arrangement order.  In\nFirstrand\r\nBank Ltd v Fillis\n2010 (6) SA 565\n(ECP) para 16, Eksteen J, in\r\nconstruing\ns 88(3)\nof the NCA, stated that-\n‘\n[i]t follows\r\n. . . that once the jurisdictional requirement set out in\ns 88(3)(\na\n)\r\nco-exists with any one of the jurisdictional requirements set out in\ns 88(3)(\nb\n), the credit provider is at liberty to proceed and\r\nto exercise and enforce, by litigation or other judicial process, any\r\nright\nor security under his credit agreement, without further\r\nnotice.’\n[19]\r\nBoth the Constitutional Court in\nFerris & another v Firstrand\r\nBank Ltd\n2014 (3) SA 39\n(CC) para 16, and this court recently in\nJili v Firstrand Bank\n(763/13)\n[2014] ZASCA 183\n(26 November\r\n2014) para 22, cited with approval the passage in\nFillis\nquoted\r\nabove.  Moseneke ACJ, in delivering the unanimous judgment of\r\nthe court in\nFerris\n, said the following:\n‘\n[14] . . .\r\nOnce the restructuring order had been breached, FirstRand was\r\nentitled to enforce the loan without further notice. This\nis clear\r\nfrom the wording of the relevant sections of the Act. Section\r\n88(3)(\nb\n)(ii) does not require further notice — it merely\r\nprecludes a credit provider from enforcing a debt under debt review\r\nunless,\namong other things, the debtor defaults on a\r\ndebt-restructuring order. Moreover, s 129(2) expressly stipulates\r\nthat the requirement\nto send a notice under s 129(1) is not\r\napplicable to debts subject to debt-restructuring orders.’\n[20]\r\nLeach JA in\nJili\n, para 25, concluded that-\n‘\n. . . the\r\nappellant’s default under the debt re-arrangement order\r\nentitled the respondent, without further ado, to proceed\nto recover\r\nthe motor vehicle in question from her.’\n[21]\r\nThe decision of this court in\nNaidoo\nand that of the\r\nConstitutional Court in\nFerris\nwere referred to in the\r\njudgment of the high court. The legal principles enunciated in the\r\ntwo decisions were binding on that court\nand precluded it from\r\narriving at any of the three conclusions to which I have referred. \r\nThe statement of principle by Didcott\nJ in\nCredex Finance (Pty)\r\nLtd v Kuhn\n1977 (3) SA 482\n(N) that is thus concisely summarised\r\nin the headnote to that judgment is in point:\n‘\nThe doctrine\r\nof judicial precedent would be subverted if judicial officers, of\r\ntheir own accord or at the instance of litigants,\nwere to refuse to\r\nfollow decisions binding on them in the hope that appellate tribunals\r\nwith the power to do so might be persuaded\nto reverse the decisions\r\nand thus to vindicate them\nex post facto\n.  Such a course\r\ncannot be tolerated.’\n[22]\r\nThe Constitutional Court, in\nCamps Bay Ratepayers’ and\r\nResidents’ Association & another v Harrison & another\n2011 (4) SA 42\n(CC), paras 28-30, expressed itself in no\r\nuncertain terms about observance by courts of the maxim\nstare\r\ndecisis\nor the doctrine of precedent.  Brand AJ, in\r\ndelivering the unanimous judgment of the court said:\n‘\nConsiderations\r\nunderlying the doctrine were formulated extensively by Hahlo &\r\nKahn [Hahlo & Kahn\nThe South African Legal System and its\r\nBackground\n(Juta), Cape Town 1968) at 214-15].  What it\r\nboils down to, according to the authors, is: '(C)ertainty,\r\npredictability, reliability,\nequality, uniformity, convenience: these\r\nare the principal advantages to be gained by a legal system from the\r\nprinciple of\nstare decisis\n.'  Observance of the doctrine\r\nhas been insisted upon, both by this court and by the Supreme Court\r\nof Appeal.  And I believe\nrightly so. The doctrine of precedent\r\nnot only binds lower courts, but also binds courts of final\r\njurisdiction to their own decisions.\nThese courts can depart from a\r\nprevious decision of their own only when satisfied that that decision\r\nis clearly wrong.\nStare decisis\nis therefore not simply a\r\nmatter of respect for courts of higher authority. It is a\r\nmanifestation of the rule of law itself, which\nin turn is a founding\r\nvalue of our Constitution.  To deviate from this rule is to\r\ninvite legal chaos.’\n(Footnotes are\r\nomitted.)\n[23]\r\nThe formal and substantive requisites for a final sequestration order\r\nhave been established. There are no circumstances that\nwarrant the\r\nexercise of a court’s discretion in favour of the respondents.\r\nThe high court should have sequestrated the joint\nestate of the\r\nrespondents.\n[24]\r\nIn the result the following order is made:\n(a)\r\nThe appeal succeeds with costs, which costs shall be paid out of the\r\njoint estate of the respondents as part of the costs of\n\nsequestration.\n(b)\r\nThe order of the court a quo is set aside and replaced with:\n‘\nThe joint\r\nestate of the respondents is placed under final sequestration.’\n___________________\nPA\r\nMeyer\nActing\r\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFor\r\nAppellant: L Meintjes\nInstructed\r\nby: Rorich Wolmarans & Luderitz Inc, Pretoria\nSymington\r\n& De Kok, Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent: SS Cohen\nInstructed by:\r\nLedwaba Attorneys c/o Phukubye Attorneys, Pretoria\nMoroka\r\nAttorneys, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "Firstrand Bank Ltd granted an overdraft facility to Raymond and Amie Kona in August 2006, secured by a first and a second mortgage bond over the respondents' home. By August 2011 the debt stood at R953,903.48 plus interest. In 2008 the respondents applied for debt review under s 86 of the National Credit Act (NCA). A debt counsellor declared them over‑indebted and obtained a debt re‑arrangement order in August 2009, which reduced the interest rate on the bank's claim to 5% and extended payment periods. The respondents later defaulted on the re‑arranged payments. Firstrand instituted legal action for payment in 2011 and, in March 2012, applied to sequestrate the respondents' joint estate. A provisional sequestration order was granted in August 2013 but set aside by the High Court in March 2014, which held that a credit provider’s sequestration application constituted “other judicial process” prohibited by s 88(3) of the NCA and that the existing debt re‑arrangement order barred compulsory sequestration.",
    "issues": "1. Whether s 88(3) of the NCA bars a credit provider from instituting sequestration proceedings against a consumer whose debt is subject to a debt re‑arrangement order. 2. Whether the existence of a debt re‑arrangement order, even if not set aside, constitutes a bar to the grant of a compulsory sequestration order.",
    "principles": "The Court reaffirmed that sequestration proceedings are not “legal proceedings to enforce the agreement” within the meaning of s 129(1)(b) and therefore do not fall within the prohibition of s 88(3) of the NCA (Naidoo v ABSA Bank Ltd; Investec Bank Ltd v Mutemeri). It held that once a debtor is in default under both the credit agreement and the debt re‑arrangement order, the creditor may enforce its rights without further notice (Firstrand Bank Ltd v Fillis; Ferris & another v Firstrand Bank Ltd). The doctrine of stare decisis obliges lower courts to follow these precedents, and the High Court erred in deviating from them. A debt re‑arrangement order merely creates a moratorium on enforcement; the moratorium lifts upon default, and it is not a substantive bar to sequestration.",
    "application": "Applying the above principles, the Court concluded that Firstrand’s sequestration application did not constitute “other judicial process” prohibited by s 88(3). The respondents’ default on both the loan and the debt re‑arrangement order removed any moratorium, making the existence of the re‑arrangement order immaterial to the sequestration application. Consequently, the High Court’s findings that the debt re‑arrangement order barred sequestration and that sequestration was a prohibited enforcement action were inconsistent with binding precedent.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeds. The High Court’s provisional sequestration order is set aside and replaced with a final order placing the joint estate of the respondents under sequestration. Costs of the appeal are to be paid out of the joint estate as part of the costs of sequestration."
