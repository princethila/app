The amending provisions were\r\nintroduced by the\nRoad Accident Fund Amendment Act 19 of 2005\n. \r\nThis Act and the Regulations came into force on 1 August 2008. \r\nThe threshold requirement for the obligation of the\nRoad Accident\r\nFund (the Fund) to pay general damages is that the Fund must be\r\nsatisfied that the injury has been correctly assessed\nas ‘serious’\r\nin accordance with the method prescribed in the Regulations. \r\nThe ‘American Medical Association’s\nGuides to the\r\nEvaluation of Permanent Impairment Sixth Edition’ (the AMA\r\nGuides) must be applied in the assessment. \nThe question that\r\narises in this appeal is whether reg 3(1)(b)(i) makes the application\r\nof the AMA Guides in the assessment of\nwhether a third party’s\r\ninjury is ‘serious’  dependent on the existence of\r\n‘operational guidelines’.\n[2]\r\nThe history of ‘the statutory road accident compensation\r\nscheme’ is set out in the judgment of Moseneke DCJ in\nLaw\r\nSociety of South Africa & others v Minister of Transport &\r\nanother\n2011 (1) SA 400\n(CC) paras 17-28.  The matrix of the\r\nlegislative scheme that is also relevant to this appeal is to be\r\nfound in the judgment\nof Brand JA in\nRoad Accident Fund v Duma &\r\nthree similar cases\n2013 (6) SA 9\n(SCA) paras 3-10.  I first\r\nrefer briefly to the legislative scheme in order to contextualize reg\r\n3(1)(\nb\n)(iv).\n[3]\r\nSection 17(1) of the Act limits the obligation of the Fund to\r\ncompensate third parties for general damages (non-pecuniary loss)\nto\r\nthose instances in which the third party has suffered a ‘serious\r\ninjury’. In terms of s 17(1)(A) the assessment\nof a serious\r\ninjury ‘shall be based on a prescribed method’ and ‘shall\r\nbe carried out by a medical practitioner’.\nThe Act, as was held\r\nin\nDuma\nparas 5-6, does not provide an objective standard for\r\ndeciding on the seriousness of the injuries but stipulates that the\r\nassessment\nshould be made by a medical practitioner on the basis of a\r\nprescribed method and empowers the minister to promulgate\r\nRegulations.\n[4]\r\nRegulation 3 prescribes the method contemplated in s 17(1) for the\r\ndetermination of ‘serious injury’. A third party\nwho\r\nwishes to claim general damages must submit him- or herself to an\r\nassessment by a medical practitioner (reg 3(1)(\na\n)).  Once\r\nassessed the third party ‘shall obtain from the medical\r\npractitioner concerned a serious injury assessment\nreport (reg\r\n3(3)(\na\n)), which is defined as ‘a duly completed form RAF\r\n4’ and attached to the Regulations as annexure D (reg 1). \r\nThe\nRAF 4 form itself, read with reg 3(1)(\nb\n), requires the\r\nmedical practitioner to assess whether the third party's injury is\r\n'serious' in accordance with three sets of criteria\n(See\nDuma\nparas 6-7):\n(a)\r\nFirst, if the injury meets the description of any one or any\r\ncombination of the injuries listed in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(i) (as\r\namended by the Road Accident Fund Amendment Regulations, 2013) it\r\nshall not be assessed as serious.  If the injury\nfalls within\r\nthe list the third party is only ‘entitled to be assessed in\r\nterms of regulations 3(1)(\nb\n)(ii) and 3(1)(\nb\n)(iii)’\r\nif ‘any complication arises from any one, or any combination of\r\nthe injuries’ listed in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(i).  A\r\n‘complication’, in terms of the amended reg 1, ‘means\r\nany medical complication and, or (sic) functional\nimpairment relating\r\nto the third party, which in the opinion of the medical practitioner,\r\ncould result in the injury being assessed\nas serious in terms of sub\r\nregulation 3(1)(\nb\n)(ii) and/or 3(1)(\nb\n)(iii)’.\n(b) Second, the\r\nthird party's injury must be assessed as 'serious' if it ‘resulted\r\nin 30 per cent or more Impairment of the\nWhole Person’ (WPI) as\r\nprovided in the AMA Guides (reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(ii) read with reg 1). \r\nThis is where reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) fits into the legislative\r\nscheme.  Regulations 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) – (vi) provide as\r\nfollows:\n‘\n(iv)\r\nThe AMA Guides must be applied by the medical practitioner in\r\naccordance with operational guidelines or amendments, if any,\n\npublished by the Minister from time to time by notice in the Gazette.\n(v)\r\nDespite anything to the contrary in the AMA Guides, in assessing the\r\ndegree of impairment, no number stipulated in the AMA Guides\nis to be\r\nrounded up or down, regardless of whether the number represents an\r\ninitial, an intermediate, a combined or a final value,\nunless the\r\nrounding is expressly required or permitted by the guidelines issued\r\nby the Minister.\n(vi)\r\nThe Minister may approve a training course in the application of the\r\nAMA Guides by notice in the Gazette and then the assessment\nmust be\r\ndone by a medical practitioner who has successfully completed such a\r\ncourse.’\nIt\r\nis common cause that no operational guidelines have been published by\r\nthe minister under reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv).\n(c)\r\nThird, an injury which does not result in 30 per cent or more WPI may\r\nnonetheless be assessed as serious under what has become\nknown as the\r\n'narrative test' if that injury resulted in a serious long-term\r\nimpairment or loss of a body function;  constitutes\npermanent\r\nserious disfigurement; resulted in severe long-term mental or severe\r\nlong-term behavioural disturbance or disorder; \nor resulted in\r\nloss of a foetus (reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iii)).\n[5]\r\nThe Fund is only liable for general damages if a claim is supported\r\nby a serious injury assessment report (the RAF 4 form) ‘and\nthe\r\nFund is satisfied that the injury has been correctly assessed as\r\nserious in terms of the method provided for in these Regulations’\n\n(reg 3(3)(\nc\n)).  If the Fund is not so satisfied, it must\r\neither reject the third party’s RAF 4 form or direct that the\r\nthird party\nsubmits him- or herself to a further assessment by a\r\nmedical practitioner designated by the Fund in accordance with the\r\nmethod\nprescribed in the regulations (reg 3(3)(\nb\n)).  The\r\nregulations go on to provide for a dispute resolution procedure. \r\nIt culminates in a determination by an appeal\ntribunal consisting of\r\nthree medical practitioners appointed by the registrar of the Health\r\nProfessions Council.   If\nthe dispute resolution procedure\r\nis not resorted to, the rejection of the RAF 4 form or the assessment\r\nby the Fund’s designated\nmedical practitioner, as the case may\r\nbe, becomes ‘final and binding’ (reg 3(5)(\na\n)).  \r\nThe determination of a dispute, if one is declared, by the appeal\r\ntribunal is also ‘final and binding’\n(reg 3(13)).\n[6]\r\nIt was held in\nDuma\npara 19 that-\n‘\n[i]n\r\naccordance with the model that the legislature chose to adopt, the\r\ndecision whether or not the injury of a third party is serious\nenough\r\nto meet the threshold requirement for an award of general damages was\r\nconferred on the Fund and not on the court. That much\nappears from\r\nthe stipulation in reg 3(3)(\nc\n) that the Fund shall only be\r\nobliged to pay general damages if the Fund — and not the court\r\n— is satisfied that the\ninjury has correctly been assessed in\r\naccordance with the RAF 4 form as serious. Unless the Fund is so\r\nsatisfied the plaintiff\nsimply has no claim for general damages. This\r\nmeans that unless the plaintiff can establish the jurisdictional fact\r\nthat the Fund\nis so satisfied, the court has no jurisdiction to\r\nentertain the claim for general damages against the Fund. Stated\r\nsomewhat differently,\nin order for the court to consider a claim for\r\ngeneral damages, the third party must satisfy the Fund, not the\r\ncourt, that his\nor her injury was serious.’\n[7]\r\nRecently this court in\nRoad Accident Fund v Faria\n2014 (6) SA\r\n19\n(SCA) para 34 said that:\n‘\n[t]he\r\namendment Act, read together with the Regulations, has introduced two\r\n‘paradigm shifts’ that are relevant to the\ndetermination\r\nof this appeal:  (i)  general damages may only be awarded\r\nfor injuries that have been assessed as ‘serious’\nin\r\nterms thereof and  (ii)  the assessment of injuries as\r\n‘serious’ has been made an administrative rather\nthan a\r\njudicial decision.’\n[8]\r\nThe three appellants as plaintiffs instituted separate actions\r\nagainst the Fund in the North Gauteng Division of the High Court,\n\nPretoria, for the damages they suffered as a result of injuries they\r\nsustained in motor vehicle accidents that occurred after 1\nAugust\r\n2008.  General damages form part of the relief claimed in each\r\naction.  The stance adopted by the appellants in\neach action is\r\nthat compliance with reg 3 is ‘legally impossible’ in the\r\nabsence of operational guidelines in relation\nto the application of\r\nthe AMA Guides.  The first and second appellants each launched\r\nan application after the close of pleadings\nin their respective\r\nactions in which they sought declaratory relief in accordance with\r\ntheir interpretation of reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv).  They joined the\r\nminister in each application, who gave notice that he would abide the\r\ndecision of the court. \nAlthough it opposed the second\r\nappellant’s application (the second appellant’s\r\napplication for declaratory relief)\nthe Fund failed to oppose the\r\nfirst appellant’s application.  Default judgment in\r\naccordance with the relief prayed\nfor in the notice of motion was\r\ngranted in the first appellant’s application.  The Fund\r\nthen launched an application\nfor rescission of the default judgment,\r\nwhich application was opposed by the first appellant (the Fund’s\r\nrescission application). \nThe third appellant raised the issue\r\nby way of an objection to an application for the amendment of the\r\nFund’s special plea\nin which the third appellant’s\r\nnon-compliance with reg 3 was raised (the Fund’s application\r\nfor amendment).\n[9]\r\nThe appellants and the Fund agreed that a determination of the\r\nfollowing questions is dispositive of the Fund’s rescission\n\napplication, the second appellant’s application for declaratory\r\nrelief and the Fund’s application for amendment: \nwhether\r\n(a) reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) requires operational guidelines to be\r\npublished by the minister before the AMA Guides can be applied in the\r\ndetermination\nof a claimant’s WPI;\n(b)\r\nthe AMA Guides can be applied for purposes of the Regulations in the\r\nabsence of operational guidelines published by the minister;\nand\n(c) a claimant is\r\nexcused from compliance with the regulations by virtue of the maxim\nlex non cogit ad impossibilia\n(the law does not compel a\r\nperson to perform that which is impossible) if the AMA Guides cannot\r\nbe applied for purposes of the regulations\nin the absence of\r\noperational guidelines.\n[10]\r\nThe three applications were heard together by Kgomo J on 26 July\r\n2013.  The high court was called upon to determine the\nthree\r\nquestions.  Judgment was delivered on 30 August 2013.  The\r\ninterpretation of reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) contended for by the\r\nappellants did not find favour with the high court.  In\r\nanswering questions (a) and (b) in favour\nof the Fund the high court\r\nheld that the phrase ‘if any’ in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv)\r\napplies to and qualifies both the publication of ‘amendments’\r\nand of ‘operational guidelines’. The\nminister was\r\ntherefore, so the high court held, not obliged to publish guidelines\r\nbefore the AMA Guides could be applied. Instead\nof granting orders\r\nappropriate to each application the high court made the following\r\norder:\n‘\n1.\r\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\n2. The costs shall\r\ninclude the costs attendant on the employment of two counsel.’\n[11]\r\nThe appeal lies against this order with the leave of this court. The\r\nFund did not cross-appeal.  Counsel, however, informed\nus that\r\nthe determination of the central legal issue raised in this appeal is\r\naccepted as decisive of each application and that\nthe parties had\r\nagreed to act upon the decision in a manner appropriate to what each\r\napplication’s outcome should have been.\n[12]\r\nWith reference to the language used in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv), the\r\nappellants contend that it envisages and requires the publication of\r\noperational guidelines, which ‘must’\nbe applied in order\r\nto apply the AMA Guides. The injunction, they contend, is\r\nperemptory.  They contrast the language of reg\n3(1)(\nb\n)(iv)\r\nwith that used in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(i) prior to its amendment\r\n(‘[t]he Minister may publish’ a list of non-serious\r\ninjuries, which was indeed done) and\nin reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(v) (‘[t]he\r\nMinister may approve a training course . . . by notice in the\nGazette\nand then the assessment must be done . . .’).  The\r\nappellants contend that those provisions are plainly discretionary\n\nwhereas reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) by contrast is peremptory.  The\r\nwords ‘if any’ used in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv), so they\r\ncontend, only qualify and apply to the publication of amendments and\r\nnot to both the publication of amendments and\noperational guidelines\n[13]\r\nRegulation 3(1)(b)(iv) must be interpreted in accordance with the\r\nestablished principles of interpretation. (See\nNatal Joint\r\nMunicipal Pension Fund v Endumeni Municipality\n2012 (4) SA 593\n(SCA) para 18;\nBothma-Batho Transport (Edms) Bpk v S Bothma\r\n& Seun Transport (Edms) Bpk\n2014 (2) SA 494\n(SCA) para 12.)\r\nThe meaning to be attributed to reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) as contended\r\nfor by the appellants is not sensible and has no basis in its\r\nlanguage or in context.  The language used\nclearly confers a\r\ndiscretion on the minister to publish operational guidelines and the\r\napplication of the AMA Guides is not dependent\non the existence of\r\noperational guidelines.  Reference to the context supports this\r\nlegislative intent.\n[14]\r\nAs to language, the words ‘if any’ in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv)\r\ndenote that the publication of ‘operational guidelines’\r\nor of ‘amendments’ thereto is discretionary.\nAn\r\nalteration of the punctuation used in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) is\r\nrequired in order to sustain the interpretation contended for by the\r\nappellants:  the insertion of a comma after the\nwords\r\n‘operational guidelines’ and the deletion of the comma\r\nafter the word ‘amendments’.  (‘The\nAMA Guides\r\nmust be applied by the medical practitioner in accordance with\r\noperational guidelines, or amendments if any, published\nby the\r\nMinister from time to time by notice in the Gazette.’) \r\nThe distinction which the appellants seek to draw between\noperational\r\nguidelines and amendments is artificial:  once operational\r\nguidelines, if published, are amended they remain operational\n\nguidelines in accordance with which the AMA Guides must then be\r\napplied.  The obligation created in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) by\r\nthe use of the word ‘must’ is one placed conditionally\r\nupon the medical practitioner:  the AMA Guides\n‘must’\r\nbe applied by the medical practitioner in accordance with ‘any’\r\noperational guidelines or amendments\n‘if’ published. \r\n No obligation is placed on the minister.  The publication\r\nof operational guidelines\nis clearly not a condition precedent to the\r\napplication of the AMA Guides in the assessment whether an injury is\r\n‘serious’.\n[15]\r\nThe same legislative intent is reinforced when reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv)\r\nis considered contextually.  The use of the permissive or\r\nfacultative word ‘may’ in the other regulations\nreferred\r\nto by the appellants and not in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) is no\r\nindication that the publication of operational guidelines is\r\nperemptory.  The statutory provision in reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv)\r\nconcerning the publication of operational guidelines is not couched\r\nin words which have an affirmative or imperative character,\nsuch as\r\n‘shall’ or ‘must’.  There is also no\r\nother provision in the Regulations, or in the Act, which\nimposes an\r\nobligation on the minister to publish operational guidelines in order\r\nfor the AMA Guides to find application.\n[16]\r\nThere is nothing in the other provisions of the regulations and of\r\nthe Act which lends any weight to the interpretation contended\nfor by\r\nthe appellants.  On the contrary, that interpretation will\r\nresult in the absurdity that the AMA Guides, which take\ncentre stage\r\nin the administrative determination of whether an injury is ‘serious’\r\nto qualify for an award of general\ndamages in terms of s 17(1) of the\r\nAct, cannot be applied until such time as the minister publishes\r\noperational guidelines even\nthough the minister may consider the\r\npublication of operational guidelines not necessary or expedient.\r\nFurthermore, there is no\nimpediment, it is common cause, to the\r\npractical application of the AMA Guides in the absence of operational\r\nguidelines.\n[17]\r\nI conclude, therefore, that the publication by the minister of\r\noperational guidelines or amendments under reg 3(1)(\nb\n)(iv) is\r\ndiscretionary.  The application of the AMA Guides in the\r\nassessment whether the third party's injury is 'serious'\nto qualify\r\nfor general damages is not dependent on the existence of operational\r\nguidelines.  The conclusion at which the high\ncourt arrived\r\ntherefore cannot be faulted and the appeal cannot succeed.\n[18]\r\nFinally, the matter of costs.  The interpretation contended for\r\nby the appellants, without intending to be unkind, is\nrather\r\nopportunistic and seems to be an attempt to avoid compliance with the\r\nRegulations despite the clear and unambiguous wording\nof reg\r\n3(1)(\nb\n)(iv). I agree with the Fund’s contention that the\r\nconstruction contended for by the appellants is linguistically and\r\ncontextually\nuntenable.\nI am, therefore, not\r\npersuaded that the circumstances of this case warrant a deviation\r\nfrom the general principle that costs should\nfollow the event.\n[19]\r\nIn the result the following order is made:\nThe appeal is\r\ndismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.\n___________________\nPA\r\nMeyer\nActing\r\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFor\r\nAppellants: BP Geach SC, CM Dredge\nInstructed\r\nby: Van Zyl Le Roux Inc., Pretoria\nHoney\r\nAttorneys, Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nFirst Respondent: S Budlender, L Kutumela\nInstructed by:\r\nLindsay Keller c/o Friedland Hart Attorneys, Pretoria\nMatsepe\r\nAttorneys, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The three appellants were injured in motor vehicle accidents that occurred after 1 August 2008. They sued the Road Accident Fund for general damages, relying on the Road Accident Fund Act and its 2008 regulations. They argued that regulation 3(1)(b)(iv) makes the application of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides) dependent on the Minister of Transport publishing operational guidelines, which had not been done. The High Court dismissed their applications and awarded costs, prompting the appellants to appeal.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised three central questions: (a) whether regulation 3(1)(b)(iv) requires the Minister to publish operational guidelines before the AMA Guides can be used to assess a claimant's whole‑person impairment; (b) whether the AMA Guides can be applied in the absence of such guidelines; and (c) whether the appellants are excused from complying with the regulation under the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia if the guidelines are missing.",
    "principles": "The court applied principles of statutory and regulatory interpretation, emphasizing that the words \"if any\" indicate discretion for the Minister to publish guidelines or amendments. It referenced established interpretive authorities such as Natal Joint Municipal Pension Fund v Endumeni Municipality and Bothma‑Batho Transport v S Bothma. The court also considered precedent from Road Accident Fund v Duma and Road Accident Fund v Faria, which highlighted that the assessment of serious injury is an administrative, not judicial, function and that the Fund, not the court, determines liability for general damages.",
    "application": "Applying the interpretive principles, the court concluded that regulation 3(1)(b)(iv) does not impose a mandatory duty on the Minister to issue operational guidelines; the publication is discretionary. Consequently, the absence of such guidelines does not render the regulation impossible to comply with, nor does it excuse claimants from its requirements. The High Court’s interpretation was therefore affirmed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel. The court affirmed that the Road Accident Fund is not obliged to publish operational guidelines before the AMA Guides can be applied, and the appellants' interpretation of the regulation was untenable."
