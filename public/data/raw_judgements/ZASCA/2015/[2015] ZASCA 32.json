In response, the\r\nrespondents raised two\n‘special\r\npleas’: first, that the claim had prescribed and, second,\nrelying on the\nso-called\n‘once\nand\nfor\nall’\nprinciple,\n[1]\nthat\nthe\nappellant\nwas\nprecluded\nfrom\nrecovering\nits\nalleged\ndamages\nas\nsuch\nloss\nought\nto\nhave\nbeen\nclaimed\nin\nprevious\r\nproceedings between the parties.\n[2] When the matter came to\r\ntrial in the Gauteng Division, Johannesburg the court, acting under\r\nthe provisions of Uniform rule 33(4),\nordered that the two special\r\npleas be decided at the outset as separate issues. Thereafter, having\r\nreceived certain documents and\nheard counsel for both sides, it\r\nupheld both special pleas and dismissed the appellant’s claim.\r\nA subsequent application\nfor leave to appeal was also dismissed. The\r\nappeal to this court lies with its leave.\n[3] It is unnecessary to\r\nspell out the precise details of the lease that lies at the heart of\r\nthe dispute. Suffice it to say that\nit relates to certain immovable\r\nproperty in Richmond known as Richmond Forum; that as at 31 July 2007\r\nthe appellant became the\nregistered owner of the property; that the\r\nappellant leased office space and parking bays situated on the\r\nproperty to the first\nrespondent under a written agreement of lease\r\nand an addendum thereto that was due to expire on 30 September 2010;\r\nand that the\nsecond respondent had bound himself as surety and\r\nco-principal debtor for the obligations of the first respondent\r\narising from\nthe lease.\n[4] Clause 26.1 of the\r\nlease provided that in the event of the first respondent having\r\nfailed to pay any amount due in terms of\nthe lease within seven days\r\nof being obliged to do so, the appellant would be entitled to cancel\r\nthe lease on written notice and\nto claim immediate repossession of\r\nthe leased premises. Clauses 26.2 and 26.3 further provided as\r\nfollows:\n‘\n26.2 While the\r\nLessee remains in occupation of the Premises and irrespective of any\r\ndispute between the parties, including, but\nnot being restricted to a\r\ndispute as to the Lessor’s right to terminate this lease the ─\n26.2.1   \r\nLessee shall continue to pay all amounts due to the Lessor in terms\r\nof this lease on the due dates;\n26.2.2   \r\nLessor shall be entitled to recover and accept such payments;\n26.2.3   \r\nAcceptance by the Lessor of such payments shall be without prejudice\r\nto and shall not in any manner whatsoever\naffect the Lessor’s\r\nright to terminate this lease or to claim any damages whatsoever.\n26.3 Should the dispute\r\nbetween the Lessor and the Lessee be determined in favour of the\r\nLessor the payments made to the Lessor\nin terms of this clause 26\r\nshall be regarded as amounts paid by the Lessee in respect of any\r\nloss and/or damages sustained by the\nLessor as a result of the\r\nbreach.’\n[5] Although the first\r\nrespondent complied with its obligations under the lease until 31\r\nOctober 2007, it thereafter proceeded to\nfall into arrears and by 1\r\nMarch 2009 had become indebted to the appellant in a sum in excess of\r\nR2 million in respect of unpaid\nrental and other charges.\r\nConsequently, on 6 March 2009 the appellant exercised its right under\r\nclause 26.1 to cancel the lease.\nThe first respondent, however,\r\ndisputed the validity of the cancellation and refused to vacate the\r\nleased premises.\n[6] As  a result of\r\nthe first respondent’s attitude,  the appellant instituted\r\nmotion proceedings in the high court\non 6 October 2009, seeking the\r\neviction of the first respondent from the leased premises. In\r\naddition it sought payment by both\nrespondents not only of the sum of\r\nR2 058 260,60 due at date of cancellation of the lease but of a\r\nfurther amount of R750 298,04\ndue under the provisions of clause 26.2\r\nof the lease in respect of the first respondent’s occupation of\r\nthe leased premises\nfrom April 2009 to September 2009. For\r\nconvenience these proceedings will be referred to as ‘the first\r\napplication’.\n[7] The respondents opposed\r\nthe first application, contending that the lease had been unlawfully\r\ncancelled. However the court concluded\notherwise. On 24 March 2010,\r\nit rejected the respondents’ defence and granted the appellant\r\nthe relief it sought. Despite\nthis setback, the respondents remained\r\nobdurate; they sought leave to appeal and the first respondent\r\nstubbornly continued to remain\nin occupation of the leased premises\r\nuntil their application for leave to appeal was dismissed on 29 April\r\n2010.\n[8] Faced with the\r\ninevitable, the first respondent eventually vacated the premises a\r\nfew days later. But despite this, the respondents\nbrought further\r\napplications for leave to appeal, firstly, to this court and,\r\nthereafter, to the Constitutional Court. Their view\nof the strength\r\nof their case proved to be misplaced as both applications were\r\ndismissed, on 24 June 2010 and 16 August 2010, respectively.\n[9] In the meantime, the\r\nappellant had on 20 April 2010 instituted further motion proceedings\r\nin the high court (‘the second\napplication’) in which it\r\nonce more sought an order against the respondents for payment under\r\nclause 26.2 of the lease. On\nthis occasion its claim related to the\r\nperiod October 2009 to April 2010 (ie from immediately after the\r\nperiod that was the subject\nof the claim in the first application up\r\nto the date the first respondent vacated the premises.)\n[10] Although the\r\nrespondents initially opposed the proceedings, they subsequently\r\nconceded liability. Accordingly, on 29 September\n2010, the parties\r\nentered into a written settlement of their dispute that was made an\r\norder of court on 12 October 2010. In terms\nof this agreement, the\r\nrespondents undertook to pay the appellant R1 741 302 together with\r\ninterest by way of agreed instalments.\n[11] This still did not\r\nbring an end to litigation between the parties. On 16 March 2012, the\r\nappellant issued summons in the present\ncase in which it claimed\r\ndamages from the respondents in the sum of R1 192 493,81 allegedly\r\nsuffered due to the first respondent’s\nbreach of the lease and\r\nits resultant cancellation.  In its particulars of claim the\r\nappellant alleged that after the lease\nhad been cancelled the first\r\nrespondent had remained in unlawful occupation of the leased premises\r\nuntil the end of April 2010;\nthat the first respondent had made\r\npayments of all amounts owing by it in terms of the lease until 15\r\nApril 2010, and that:\n‘\nAs a result of the\r\n(first respondent’s) breach of the lease agreement and the\r\nresultant cancellation thereof, the (appellant)\nhas suffered damages\r\nin the amount of R1 192 493,81 which damages represent the rental,\r\noperating costs, rates, open parking, basement\nparking, parking\r\n(additional premises), water, refuse, sewerage and electricity which\r\nthe (appellant) would have received in respect\nof the period 16 April\r\n2010 to 30 September 2010 but for the (first respondent’s)\r\nbreach of the lease agreement.’\n[12] It was in pleading to\r\nthis claim that the respondents raised the two special pleas\r\nmentioned at the outset of this judgment\nthat were upheld by the\r\ncourt a quo. But despite this success, the respondents have since\r\nlost confidence in their second special\nplea and, in this court,\r\nabandoned any reliance on it. In doing so they conceded that the\r\nfirst and second applications had not\ninvolved claims for damages but\r\nthe enforcement of the provisions of clause 26 of the lease, and that\r\nthe ‘once and for all’\nrule relating to claims for\r\ndamages had therefore been of no application. Accordingly the appeal\r\nturns solely on whether the plea\nof prescription was correctly upheld\r\nin the court a quo.\n[13] Turning to the issue\r\nof prescription, the respondents admitted in their plea that the\r\nlease had been cancelled on 6 March 2009\ndue to the first\r\nrespondent’s breach, that the first respondent had remained in\r\nunlawful occupation until the end of April\n2010, and that the first\r\nrespondent had made payment for all amounts owing under the lease\r\nagreement until 15 April 2010 (those\npayments of course having\r\nincluded the payments made under clause 26.2 pursuant to its\r\nenforcement by way of the first and second\napplications). However the\r\nrespondents pleaded that the appellant’s claim had arisen on\r\nthe date of cancellation of the agreement\non 6 March 2009, that the\r\nsummons had been served more than three years later on 19 March 2012,\r\nand that the claim for damages\nflowing from that breach had therefore\r\nprescribed under\ns 11\nof the\nPrescription Act 68 of 1969\n.\n[14] It is common cause\r\nthat the prescriptive period applicable to the appellant’s\r\nclaim is three years. But the appellant,\nin seeking to avoid the\r\ncontention that its claim had prescribed as more than three years had\r\nelapsed after the lease was cancelled\nbefore action was instituted,\r\nargued both in this court and in the court below that although the\r\ndebt sued upon may have arisen\non date of cancellation;\n(a)    \r\nthe amounts that became payable from the date of cancellation while\r\nthe first respondent was in occupation\nof the leased premises were\r\ndue under the provisions of clause 26.2.1 of the lease;\n(b)     \r\nthe damages claimed in the present action relate to the period after\r\nthe appellant had vacated\nthe premises;\n(c)    \r\nat the earliest those damages only became ‘due’ as\r\ncontemplated in\ns 12\nof the\nPrescription Act on\n30 April 2010 when\r\nthe first respondent vacated the premises as, until then, the first\r\nrespondent was bound to pay for its occupation\nunder clause 26.2 of\r\nthe lease;\n(d)     \r\nconsequently all the\nfacta\nprobanda\nnecessary\r\nfor a complete cause of action were not present until the property\r\nhad been vacated;\n(e)    no\r\ndamages for breach of the lease were therefore due before 30 April\r\n2010, and as action had been instituted\nwithin three years of that\r\ndate, the claim had not prescribed.\n[15]\nI\r\naccept that there is a difference between the concept of a debt\n‘arising’\nand\r\na debt ‘becoming due’ as envisaged by the\nPrescription\nAct, and\nthat a debt is\nonly\ndue,\nowing\nor\npayable\n‘when\nthe\nentire\nset\nof\nfacts\nwhich\nthe\ncreditor\nmust\nprove\nto\nsucceed\nwith\nhis\nclaim\nagainst\nthe\ndebtor\nis\nin\nplace:\nwhen\neverything\r\nhas happened which would entitle the creditor to institute action and\nto\nobtain\r\njudgment’.\n[2]\nBut\nthe\nargument\nthat\nall\r\nthe\nfacta\nprobanda\nnecessary\nfor\na\ncomplete\ncause\nof\naction\nwere\nnot\npresent\nuntil\nthe\nfirst\nrespondent\nhad\nvacated\r\nthe leased premises cannot be accepted.\n[16] The\nappellant’s\nclaim\nis\nfounded\nupon\na\nbreach\nof\nthe\nlease,\nand\nthe\ngeneral rule is that where one party commits a\r\nbreach of a contract\nthe\r\nother is\nentitled to claim\r\ndamages to place\nit in the\r\nposition it would\nhave been\r\nin\nhad\nthe contract been properly and timeously\r\nperformed.\n[3]\nIn the context of a\nlease\ncancelled by the lessor due to a breach by the\r\nlessee, the prima facie measure of\ndamages\nis\nthe\nrental\nthat\nwould\nhave\nbeen\npaid\nfor\nthe\npremises\nover\nthe\nremaining\r\nperiod of the lease\n[4]\nless any amounts received which would not have\naccrued had the lease not been cancelled –\r\nand of course a lessor who cancels is\nobliged\nto\ntake\nreasonable\nsteps,\nsuch\nas\nre-letting\nthe\npremises,\nin\norder\nto\nmitigate its loss.\n[17]\nIt\r\nmust be remembered that a lease, once cancelled, comes to an end, and\nthere\nis\nthereafter\nnothing\npreventing\nthe\nlessor\nfrom\nimmediately\ninstituting\naction to place\nitself\r\nin the position in which it would\nhave\r\nbeen had\nthe\nlease\nnot\r\nbeen cancelled.\nAfter all,\nthe\nlessor’s\ndamages\namounts\nto\nthe\ndiminution\nof\r\nits estate, its so-called interest or\ninteresse\n,\n[5]\ncaused by\nthe breach\nand\ncancellation.\nSuch\nloss\nwill\nhave\nbeen\nsuffered\nwhether\nthe\nlessor\nvacates\nor\nremains\nin occupation,\nand\nconstitutes\na\ndebt\n‘immediately\nclaimable’.\n[6]\nConsequently I endorse the observations in\nHyprop\n[7]\nthat ‘continued occupation\nof the\npremises\nis\nirrelevant\nto\na\nclaim\nfor\ndamages\narising\nfrom cancelling\na\nlease due to the tenant’s breach’\n[8]\nand that the effect of the\nlessee remaining\nin\noccupation\nafter\ncancellation\nis\nto\npreclude\nit\nfrom\nalleging\nthat\nthe\nlessor\nshould have mitigated its loss before it\r\nvacated.\n[9]\n[18] I do not see how this\r\nposition can be said to be altered by the provisions of a clause such\r\nas\ns 26.2\nthat simply obliges the lessee to pay the amount that would\r\notherwise have been paid as rental should it remain in occupation and\n\ndispute the cancellation. If it does so and the cancellation is held\r\nto be valid, as was here the case, any amounts so paid under\nthe\r\nclause must be taken into account (just as the rental from a\r\nreplacement tenant would be) to determine the lessor’s actual\n\nloss. But that does not mean the loss has not been suffered or that\r\nthe claim to recover that loss has not accrued. In the present\ncase,\r\nfor example, the fact that the first respondent remained in\r\noccupation did not mean that the loss the appellant claims in\nthese\r\nproceedings had not been suffered on cancellation, even though it\r\nrelates to the period after the first respondent eventually\nvacated.\r\nTo hold otherwise would confuse the right to claim loss that has been\r\nsuffered with what is required to prove the amount\nthereof.\n[19] Consequently, on\r\ncancellation of the contract due to the respondent’s breach,\r\nthe appellant became entitled to claim\ndamages over the period from\r\nthe date of that breach to 30 September 2010 when the lease was due\r\nto expire through the effluxion\nof time. The measure of its damages\r\nwas the sum of the rentals that would have been due during that\r\nperiod, less whatever amounts\nit received in mitigation of such loss.\r\nThose amounts included the sums paid by the respondents under clause\r\n26 (albeit pursuant\nto the orders made in the first and second\r\napplications). The damages that are the subject of the present claim\r\nwere thus due and\npayable as at the date of cancellation. On that\r\ndate everything had happened which would have entitled the appellant\r\nto institute\naction and to obtain judgment in respect of the period\r\nfor which the damages presently being claimed are calculated. The\r\ndebt sued\nupon was therefore due.\n[20] The appellant’s\r\nargument that its claim only arose once the first respondent had\r\nvacated the leased premises therefore\nfalls to be rejected. So, too,\r\ndoes its further argument arising out of the rental for March 2009\r\nhaving been included in the amount\nclaimed in the first application.\r\nIt was submitted on behalf of the appellant that as the rental for\r\nthat month had been included\nin the amount in respect of which\r\njudgment was given and paid pursuant to the high court’s order\r\nin the first application,\nits patrimony had been affected only with\r\neffect from 1 April 2009 and that prescription could therefore only\r\nrun from that date.\nAs that was slightly less than three years before\r\nthe issue of summons, so it was argued, the claim therefore could not\r\nhave prescribed.\n[21] Again this loses sight\r\nof the fact that the claim arose when the contract was cancelled. It\r\nwas then that the loss was suffered,\nand while any amount in respect\r\nof rentals due thereafter recovered pursuant to the first and second\r\napplications are to be taken\ninto account in calculating the actual\r\nloss suffered, this does not mean that the claim had not risen or\r\nthat the loss suffered\nby the breach could not be claimed on\r\ncancellation.\n[22] In the result, as\r\naction was instituted more than three years after the debt sued upon\r\nhad become due, the special plea of\nprescription was correctly upheld\r\nin the court a quo. The appeal must therefore fail.\n[23]  The appeal is\r\ndismissed with costs.\n_\nL E Leach Judge\r\nof Appeal\nAppearances:\nFor the\r\nAppellant:                            \n\nJ Both SC Instructed by:\nKokinis Inc, Blairgowrie, Randburg Phatshoane Henney,\r\nBloemfontein\nFor the\r\nRespondent:                         \n\nD C Fischer SC Instructed by:\nBlakes Maphanga Attorneys, Ferndale, Randburg\nSymington & De Kok, Bloemfontein\n[1]\nAs to which see eg\nCustom Credit Corporation\r\n\t(Pty) Ltd v Shembe\n1972 (3) SA 462\n(A) at\r\n\t472A-E and\nJanse\nvan\r\n\tRensburg &others NNO v Steenkamp and another;Janse van Rensburg\r\n\t&others NNO v Myburgh & others\n2010 (1) SA 649\n(SCA) paras 27-30.\n[2]\nSee Laubser\nExtinctive Prescription\n(1996)\r\n\tat 51-2.\n[3]\nSee eg\nMostert NO v Old Mutual Life Assurance\r\n\tCompany (SA) Ltd\n2001 (4) SA 159\n(SCA) at\r\n\t187.\n[4]\nHazis v Transvaal and Deladoa Bay Investment\r\n\tCo Ltd\n1939 AD372 at 387.\n[5]\nVan der Merwe\net al Contract General\r\n\tPrinciples\n4 ed (2012) para 11.5.2.\n[6]\nDeloitte Haskins\n&\r\n\tSells Consultants (Pty) Ltd v Bowthorpe Hellerman Deutsch (Pty) Ltd\n[1990] ZASCA 136\n;\n1991 (1) SA 525\n(A)   at 532H.\n(B)\n[7]\nHyprop Investments Ltd v NCS Carriers and\r\n\tForwarding CC\n2013 (4) SA 607 (GSJ).\n[8]\nPara 36\n[9]\nPars 38.",

    "facts": "Monyetla Property Holdings owned office space and parking bays at Richmond Forum. It leased the premises to IMM Graduate School of Marketing under a written lease that expired 30 September 2010. The lease contained clause 26 allowing cancellation if the lessee failed to pay within seven days, and clause 26.2 requiring the lessee to continue paying rent during any dispute, without prejudice to the lessor’s right to terminate. The lessee fell into arrears and by March 2009 owed over R2 million. On 6 March 2009 the lessor cancelled the lease. The lessee disputed the cancellation and remained in occupation. The lessor obtained eviction orders in 2010 and later settled part of the arrears. In 2012 the lessor sued for damages amounting to R1 192 493,81, alleging loss of rent and other costs for the period after cancellation until the lease would have naturally expired. The respondents pleaded that the claim was prescribed, arguing that the cause of action arose only when the lessee vacated the premises on 30 April 2010.",
    "issues": "The primary issue was whether the lessor’s claim for damages arising from the cancellation of the lease was prescribed under section 11 of the Prescription Act, i.e., whether the cause of action arose at the date of cancellation (6 March 2009) or only when the lessee finally vacated the premises (30 April 2010). A subsidiary issue concerned the effect of clause 26.2 on the timing of the debt and whether the “once and for all” rule barred the claim.",
    "principles": "The court considered the distinction in the Prescription Act between a debt ‘arising’ and a debt ‘becoming due’, noting that a cause of action is founded when all the facta probanda are in place. It applied the general rule that a breach of contract gives rise to immediate entitlement to damages, measured by the rental that would have been payable for the unexpired lease term, less any mitigation. The court relied on precedent (Hyprop Investments Ltd v NCS Carriers) that continued occupation after cancellation does not affect the lessor’s right to claim damages, and that payments made under clause 26.2 are accounted for in assessing loss but do not postpone the date the debt becomes due.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court held that the lessor’s entitlement to damages arose at the moment of cancellation on 6 March 2009, when the loss was suffered. clause 26.2’s requirement for continued payment did not defer the debt’s due date; payments made under that clause merely reduced the quantifiable loss. Consequently, the cause of action was complete in March 2009, and the summons filed in March 2012 fell outside the three‑year prescription period. The “once and for all” defence was irrelevant because the earlier proceedings concerned enforcement of clause 26, not damages.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The special plea of prescription was correctly upheld, and the lessor’s claim for damages was held to have prescribed."
