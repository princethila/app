The rule nisi was to operate as an interim interdict pending the\ndetermination\nof the application. The Third and Fourth Respondents applied\nsuccessfully to intervene in the proceedings. On 19 February 1993 LEVINSOHN\nJ\ndismissed the Appellant's application and discharged the rule nisi. The\nAppellant was ordered to pay the costs of the First and\nSecond Respondents.\nLeave to appeal was granted to the Appellant by the Court\na quo\n. The\nThird and Fourth Respondents abide the judgment of this Court.\nIn terms of sec 2 (1) of the Import and Export Control Act No 45 of 1963\n(\"the Import Act\") the Minister of Trade and Industry and\nTourism \"may whenever\nhe deems it necessary or expedient in the public interest, by notice in the\nGazette prescribe that no goods\nof a\nspecified class or kind\n... (b)\nshall\n3 be imported into the Republic, except under the authority of and in\naccordance\nwith the conditions slated in a\npermit\nissued by him or by a person\nauthorized\nby him\". (My underlining). A person who imports any goods in\ncontravention\nof the provisions of any notice issued under sec 2 (1) commits\nan offence (sec\n4 (1) (a)). Upon conviction of the offence the goods in question may be\ndeclared forfeited to the State. (sec 4 (2)).\nOn 23 December 1988 the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and\nTechnology, acting in terms of sec 2 of the Import Act, issued Government\nNotice No R2582 and prescribed that\n\"(a) goods described in Schedule 1 shall not be imported into the Republic\nexcept by virtue of an import permit issued in terms of\nsection 2 of the said\nImport and Export Control Act, 1963\";\n\"(Hi) hereby determine that an import permit, except for the conditions\nspecified in the permit, shall be subject to the following\nconditions:\n(a) That only goods of the class and kind specified in the permit may be\nimported\".\nSchedule 1 makes no reference to Herbicides, Anti-sprouting Products, or\nPlant-growth Regulators. Government Notice R2582 came into operation on\n1 January 1989.\n4 With effect from 4 August 1989 Government Notice R1635, issued\nby\nthe Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and Technology in\nterms of sec 2 of\nthe Import Act, amended Government Notice No R2582 by the deletion\nof\nSchedule 1 and the substitution thereof by Schedule 1 A. The latter has\nthree\ncolumns, the first and third of which are headed \"Description of goods\"\n(in\nEnglish and Afrikaans respectively) and the second of which is headed\n\"Tariff\nheading/tariefpos\". Furthermore the following commodities are listed:\n\"Herbicides, anti-sprouting products and plant-growth regulators\" (tariff\nheading\n3808.30) followed by \"Disinfectants\" (tariff heading 3808.40) and \"Other\"\n(tariff heading 3808.90).\nOn 29 November 1991 Maybaker Agrichem (Pty) Ltd, the name by\nwhich the Second Respondent was formerly known until it was changed to\nits\npresent name as from 1 March 1992, applied to the Department of Trade and\nIndustry for an import permit. The application form was signed by a\ncertain\nPillay. Paragraph 4 thereof required details of the goods for which the\npermit\nwas required. The description furnished was \"H T 3808.30.90\" and the\n\"actual\nprice\" was Rl 189 000-00. Paragraph 8 which sought general remarks in\n5\nsupport of the application elicited the following information: \"Goods\nare\nrequired for agrochemical business - not obtainable locally\". Import\npermit No\n92/05081 was issued by the Department of Trade and Industry\nauthorising\nMaybaker Agrichem (Ply) Ltd to import Herbicides 3808.30.90 from any\ncountry to an amount of Rl 189 000-00. Upon the change of its name to its\npresent name permit No 92/05081 was on 3 March 1992 replaced by permit No\n92/11919 which was issued in identical terms to the Second Respondent to\nimport Herbicides 3808.30.90.\nAfter the said import permit was granted the Second Respondent, who\ncarried on the business of formulating and selling chemicals to the\nagricultural\ndistribution trade, proceeded to import a consignment of herbicides into\nthe\nRepublic. On 12 August 1992 when the Second Respondent entered the\nimported consignment of herbicides into the Republic it delivered in terms\nof\nsec 39 (1) (a) of the Customs and Excise Act No 91 of 1964 (\"the Customs\nAct\") bill of entry No 74573 in the prescribed form to the Controller of\nCustoms and Excise. The bill of entry set forth the full particulars as\nindicated\non the form and as required by the Controller of Customs and Excise.\nThe\n6\nimported goods were described therein as \"Herbicides, anti-sprouting\nproducts\nand plant-growth regulators with diuron as active ingredient\" and\nthe tariff code\nwas given as 3808.30.15. Reference was also made to permit\nNo 92/11919.\nIt is not disputed that the appropriate amount of duty was\nlevied and paid in\nrespect of the imported goods.\nIt is obvious that there is a great disparity between the import\npermit\nand the bill of entry as regards the goods to which they\nare respectively\napplicable. The\nimport permit\nrelates to \"Herbicides 3808.30.90\"\nwhereas\nthe\nbill of entry\nrefers to Tariff Code 3808.30.15 and \"Herbicides,\nanti-sprouting\nproducts and plant-growth regulators with Diuron as active ingredient\".\nIn\norder to decipher the code tariffs 3808.30.90 and 3808.30.15 it is necessary\nto\nconsult the\nHarmonized Customs and Excise Tariff Book\n(\"the Tariff\nBook\"),\nwhich is based upon the \"International Convention on the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System\". The latter according to the\nprovisions of sec 43 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Act No 84 of\n1987\nbecame part of Schedule 1 to the Customs Act on 1 January 1988. According\nto an applicable excerpt from the bulky Tariff Book tariff code\n3808.30.90\n7 relates to \"Herbicides, anti-sprouting products and plant-growth\nregulators:\nOther \"i.e. herbicides\nwithout diuron as an active\ningredient\n, while tariff code\n3808.30.15 refers to \"Herbicides,\nanti-sprouting products and plant-growth\nregulators:\nwith diuron as an\nactive ingredient\n\". It is therefore clear that the\nimport permit\nrefers to herbicides\nwithout diuron as an active\ningredient\nwhile\nthe\nbill of entry\nrelates to herbicides which\ncontain diuron as an\nactive\ningredient\n.\nSecond Respondent sold and delivered the imported consignment of\nherbicides to the First Respondent which carries on business as a retailer\nof,\ninter alia\n, herbicides used in the agricultural industry. The First\nRespondent\nwas a\nbona fide\npurchaser believing at all relevant times that the\nSecond\nRespondent could lawfully dispose of the imported herbicides. During\nAugust\n1992 Mr. Holden, the Appellant's national marketing manager visited the\nFirst\nRespondent's depot at Stanger where he noticed that First Respondent was\nin\npossession of two containers of Diuron Wettable Powder 80% which formed\npart of the consignment of herbicides imported by the Second Respondent.\nThe\nFirst Respondent admits that it is still in possession of the hulk of the\nimported\n8 consignment of herbicides which contain diuron as an active\ningredient.\nIn its Founding Affidavit the Appellant alleged that it was the\nsole\nSouth African manufacturer of diuron which was extensively\nused in the\nproduction of Diuron Flowable and Diuron Wettable Powder for use in the\nfarming industry. The Appellant claimed in its Founding Affidavit that\nthe\nSecond Respondent had wilfully and unlawfully imported herbicides of\ntariff\ncode 3808.30.15 without having the correct and proper import permit\ntherefor.\nThe Appellant's case was that the importation was unlawful since it was\ncontrary to the provisions of the Import Act and the Customs Act.\nThe First and Second Respondents in their Answering Affidavits maintained\nthat the import permit was valid and consequently the importation\nwas lawful.\nValidity of the importation\nThe first question that falls for decision is the validity of the\nimportation.\nIn terms of sec 2 (1) (b) of the Import Act the Minister is empowered to\nprescribe by notice in the\nGazette\nthat no goods \"of a specified class\nor\n9\nkind\" shall be imported into the Republic except under the\nauthority of a\npermit and in accordance with the conditions therein staled.\nThe First and Second Respondents in their Answering Affidavits maintained\nthat\nthe import permit was valid and consequently the importation was valid.\nAccording to them the only description which was relevant\nfor the purposes of\nthe import permit was the reference to the \"description of goods\" in the 1st\ncolumn of Schedule 1 A in Government\nNotice R1635 of 4 August 1989. The\nreference in the 2nd column to \"tariff heading\" or code, namely 38.30.90, was\nirrelevant for purposes\nof the import permit and was relevant only to ascertain\nthe duty payable in the circumstances. The Court\na quo\nupheld their\ncontentions by deciding that the \"description of goods\" and not the tariff\nheadings was decisive in deciding what category\nof goods required import\npermits.\nI cannot agree with this conclusion. The Minister's function is to prescribe\nand specify by notice in the\nGazette\na \"class or kind\" of goods in\nrespect of which his prescription and specification is to operate. There is no\nprovision in the Import\nAct which restricts the Ministerial specification to\n\"description of goods\" in words. The Minister's intention was to include\n\"tariff\n10 headings\" in digits to form part of each \"class or kind\". In my\njudgment the\n\"tariff headings\" constitute part of the specification of the \"class or kind\"\nof\ngoods to which they relate. As such the \"tariff headings\" are relevant\nin\ndeciding what category of goods require import permits.\nI have dealt\nsupra\nwith the great disparity between the import\npermit\nand the bill of entry. The effect of the import permit is\nthat only herbicides\nwithout diuron as an active ingredient\n, may be imported, whereas the\nbill of\nentry relates to herbicides\nwith diuron as an active ingredient\n. In\nview of this\ngreat disparity regarding the description and particulars of the goods in\nthe\nimport permit and the bill of entry, it follows that the entry of the goods\nis\ninvalid in terms of sec 40 (1) (a) of the Customs Act which provides as\nfollows:\n\"No entry shall be valid unless -\n(a) in the case of imported . . . goods,\nthe description and particulars\nof the goods . . . declared in that entry correspond with the description and\nparticulars of the goods\n... in any certificate,\npermit\n... by which\nthe importation ... of those goods is authorized\". (My underlining).\nThe answer to the first question is therefore that the importation of the\n11\nconsignment in question is invalid. The judgment of the Court\na quo\nto the contrary cannot stand.\nPermanent Interdict\nThe second question is whether the Appellant has on a balance of\nprobabilities succeeded in making out a case for a permanent interdict\nagainst\nthe First and Second Respondents. At the outset I must point out that because it\nis common cause that the Second Respondent\nhas sold and delivered the imported\nconsignment of herbicides to the First Respondent, there is no factual basis on\nwhich a permanent\ninterdict could be granted against the Second Respondent. The\nenquiry must accordingly be restricted to the First Respondent who\nis at present\nin possession of the bulk of the imported consignment of herbicides.\nThe requisites for a permanent interdict\n(mandament poenaal\nwere\nslated by INNES JA in\nSetlogelo v Setlogelo\n1914 A D 221\nat p 227 as\nfollows: \"The requisites for the right to claim an interdict are well known; a\nclear right, injury actually committed\nor reasonably apprehended, and the\nabsence of similar protection by any other ordinary remedy\". These\nrequisites\n12 are based on a passage by Van der Linden (1756-1835) in his\nKoopmans\nHandboek\n3,1.4.7 which was translated into Afrikaans\nby HIEMSTRA J in\nMeyer v Administrator. Tvl.\n1961 (4) S A 55\nT\nat p\n57A-E.\nThe question which arises is whether the Appellant has a clear\nright\nwhich can be protected. The Appellant as the sole local\nmanufacturer of\nherbicides containing diuron as an ingredient relies on a clear right at\ncommon\nlaw to carry on its lawful trade or business without unlawful interference\nfrom\nothers (\nPatz) v Greene & Co\n1907 T.S. 427\nat p 436). In modern\nlegal\nterminology the Appellant has a subjective right to exercise its trade or\nbusiness\nfreely in the absence of special legal restrictions and agreements to the\ncontrary. Such right is, however, not an absolute right but is\nex pari\nmateria\nsubject to the right of others also to trade and to subject the Appellant to\nlawful\ncompetition. Per DE VILLIERS JA in\nMatthews and Others v Young 1922\nA\nD 492\nat p 507: \"In the absence of special legal restrictions a person\nis without\ndoubt entitled to the free exercise of his trade, profession or calling,\nunless he\nhas bound himself to the contrary. But he cannot claim an absolute right to\ndo\nso without interference from another. Competition often brings about\n13\ninterference in one way or another about which rivals cannot\nlegitimately\ncomplain. But the competition and indeed all activity must itself remain\nwithin\nlawful bounds. All a person can, therefore, claim is the right to exercise\nhis\ncalling without unlawful interference from others.\"\nCan it be said that the First Respondent is an unlawful rival of\nthe\nAppellant? Has it unlawfully interfered with the trade or\nbusiness of the\nAppellant as a manufacturer of herbicides containing diuron as an\ningredient?\nOr is there a reasonably apprehended unlawful interference by the First\nRespondent with the trade or business of the Appellant? The First\nRespondent\nas a retail trader in herbicides containing diuron as an ingredient also has\nat\ncommon law a subjective right to exercise its right to trade in lawful\ncompetition with the Appellant as manufacturer of the same type of\nherbicides.\nThe Appellant has not established that it has monopolistic rights which\noust\nlawful competition from rivals. There is no legislative provision which\ndeprives lawful rivals of their rights to lawful competition with the\nAppellant.\nMoreover, the mere fact that the importation of the consignment in question\nis\ninvalid, as indicated\nsupra\n, docs not\nper se\ntaint the\nconsignment itself with\n14\nillegality in the absence of any steps in terms of the Import\nAct and the\nCustoms Act to have the consignment declared forfeited to the State.\nThe\nresult is that the imported herbicides with diuron as an ingredient are\nnot\ntainted with illegality. They are\nres in commercio\nand not\nres\nextra\ncommercium\n. They are capable of being freely and lawfully\ntraded in the\nRepublic. Since the First Respondent acquired them\nbona\nfide\nfor value and\nis in possession of them, it has a common law right to\ntrade with them in\nlawful competition with the Appellant. It follows that the Appellant is, in\nmy\njudgment, not entitled to a permanent interdict against the First\nRespondent.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs. Such costs in regard to the\nSecond\nRespondent are to include the costs of two counsel.\nC.P. JOUBERT JA CONCUR\nHEFER JA NESTADT JA F H GROSSKOPF JA",

    "facts": "The appellant, the sole South African manufacturer of diuron‑based herbicides, obtained an interim interdict to stop the first and second respondents from selling a consignment of herbicides containing diuron that had been imported under permit No 92/11919. The permit authorised import of herbicides classified under tariff code 3808.30.90 (herbicides without diuron), whereas the bill of entry listed the goods under tariff code 3808.30.15 (herbicides with diuron). The first respondent purchased the goods in good faith and remains in possession of the bulk of the consignment. The lower court had granted the interdict, which the appellant appealed.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the importation of the herbicides was valid under the Import and Export Control Act and the Customs and Excise Act given the discrepancy between the permit description and the actual goods imported. 2) Whether the appellant is entitled to a permanent interdict against the first and second respondents to prevent further sale or use of the imported herbicides.",
    "principles": "The Minister may prescribe a class or kind of goods by notice, and the specification includes both descriptive wording and tariff headings. Under section 40(1)(a) of the Customs Act, a customs entry is invalid unless the description of the goods matches that in the authorising permit. The criteria for granting a permanent interdict are a clear right, actual or reasonably apprehended injury, and the absence of an alternative remedy (Setlogelo v Setlogelo, INNES JA). Competition law principles allow lawful rivals to trade so long as they do not breach statutory restrictions.",
    "application": "The court held that tariff headings form part of the ministerial specification; therefore the permit did not cover herbicides with diuron (code 3808.30.15). Consequently, the customs entry was invalid, rendering the importation unlawful. However, because the goods had not been declared forfeited, they were not tainted with illegality and the first respondent, as a bona‑fide purchaser, retained a lawful right to trade them. The appellant had no monopoly over diuron herbicides and thus no clear right to exclude competitors. Accordingly, the appellant failed to satisfy the requirements for a permanent interdict against the first respondent, and an interdict against the second respondent was unavailable as the goods had already been transferred.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The appellant incurred costs, and the second respondent's costs include fees for two counsel. No permanent interdict was granted against either respondent."
