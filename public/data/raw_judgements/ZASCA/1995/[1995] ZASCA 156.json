The relief claimed was\nfounded on\ns 83\n(10) of the\nInsolvency Act 24 of 1936\n(\"the\nAct\") which\nis\napplicable to the administration of an insolvent close corporation (see\ns 66\nof\nthe\nClose Corporations Act 69 of 1984\nread with s 339 of the Companies Act 61 of\n1973). Various defences were raised in the answering papers but Roux J who heard\nthe application\nfound it unnecessary to deal with these and instead upheld a\npoint in\nlimine\nthat the applicant had failed to make out a case in the\nfounding papers for the relief claimed. Shortly stated, the conclusion to\nwhich\nthe learned judge\n3\ncame was that the appellant was not entitled in terms of s 83 (10) of\nthe Act to recover the proceeds derived from the realisation\nof the equipment as\nthe respondent had failed to effect the realisation in accordance with the\npreceding subsections of s 83. Accordingly,\nand because the appellant had\nformulated his claim in terms of s 83 (10) as opposed to a claim at common law\nfor the value of the\nproperty realised, it was held that the claim had to be\ndismissed. The appellant, with the necessary leave, now appeals to this court\nagainst the judgment and order of Roux J.\nShortly before the hearing in this Court the respondent's attorneys withdrew\nas attorneys of record and wrote to the registrar advising\nthat the respondent,\nwhich was no longer trading, had decided not to incur the costs of engaging an\nattorney and briefing counsel\nto appear to oppose the appeal. By this time,\nhowever, heads of argument had been filed on behalf of the respondent in which\nsubmissions\nwere made with regard to\n4\nthe other defences raised in the papers as well as the point on which the\njudgment of the Court a\nquo\nwas based. I shall deal with these defences\nlater in this judgment and after first considering the basis upon which the\nclaim was\ndismissed.\nBefore dealing with any of these issues, it is necessary, however, first to\nset out as briefly as the circumstances permit the principal\nevents leading up\nto the appellant instituting proceedings against the respondent for the relief\nclaimed.\nOn 10 December 1990 the corporation, which carried on business as the lessors\nof earthmoving equipment, entered into three separate\ninstalment sale agreements\nwith the respondent for the purchase of three items of earthmoving equipment. In\neach instance ownership\nremained vested in the respondent pending payment of the\npurchase price which was to be effected in monthly instalments over a period\nof\nthirty-six\n5\nmonths. It is not disputed that each transaction constituted an \"instalment\nsale transaction\" as defined in s 1 of the Credit Agreements\nAct 75 of 1980. On\n18 January 1991 a provisional winding up order was granted against the\ncorporation. By this time it had taken\ndelivery of the equipment from the\nrespondent and had let two of the items to clients but still had the third item\non its premises.\nIt remained, of course, substantially indebted to the\nrespondent in terms of the agreements. The appellant was appointed liquidator\nof\nthe corporation on 1 February 1991.\nOn 4 February 1991 the appellant held an informal meeting with creditors who\nhad concluded instalment sale agreements with the corporation,\nincluding the\nrespondent. It was agreed that each creditor would repossess the subject matter\nof each instalment sale agreement in\nrespect of which it had a claim and hold\nthe property as security for such claim. Although not expressly stated in the\npapers, it\nwould seem that in\n6\narriving at this agreement the parties had in mind the provisions of s 84\nof\nthe Act in terms of which (subject to the defence considered below)\nthe\ncreditors would have lost their ownership in the subject matter of each\ntransaction and acquired a hypothec in its stead.\nThe following day, ie 5 February 1991, the appellant wrote to\nthe respondent confirming the arrangement that the latter was to take\npossession of the equipment and hold it as security for its claim. The\nletter\nconcluded:\n\"1 now wish to deal with the realization of your security which is set out in\nSection 83\nof the\nInsolvency Act, a\ncopy of which is attached hereto for your\ninformation with particular reference to subparagraphs 8, 9, 10 and 11.\nClaim documents will be forwarded to you under cover of a separate letter.\nPlease have these completed and returned to me in order\nthat a decision\nregarding the realization of your security can be made.\" The respondent took\npossession of the equipment and the\nwinding up order\n7\nwas in due course made final.\nThe second meeting of creditors was held on 6 June\n1991.\nDespite a reminder from the appellant, the\nrespondent failed to submit its\nclaim which was accordingly not proved at the meeting. The respondent\nhad also by that date not given notice in writing to the Master and to\nthe\nappellant of the fact that it held the equipment as security for its claim\nas\nrequired by\ns 83\n(1); nor had it realised the equipment. On 13 June 1991\nand in terms of\ns 83\n(6), the appellant wrote to the respondent demanding\nthat the equipment immediately be delivered to him. The subsection\nprovides as follows:\n\"(6) If he has not so realized such property before the second meeting of\ncreditors, he shall as soon as possible after the commencement\nof that meeting\ndeliver the property to the trustee, for the benefit of the insolvent estate and\nif the creditor has not delivered\nthe said property to the trustee within a\nperiod of three days as from the commencement of the said meeting the trustee\nmay demand\nfrom\n8\nhim delivery of such property. If the creditor fails to comply with such demand\nof the trustee, the Master, at the request of the\ntrustee and after notice to\nthe creditor shall direct the deputy-sheriff within whose area of jurisdiction\nthe property is situate\nto attach the property and to deliver it to the trustee,\nand in that case the creditor shall be liable for the deputy-sheriff's costs,\nas\ntaxed and allowed by the Master. If those costs cannot be recovered from the\ncreditor, they shall be paid out of the estate as\npart of the costs of the\nsequestration.\"\nThe respondent simply ignored the demand and on\n14 June 1991 submitted its claim. Instead of taking the steps detailed in\ns 86\n(6) for the recovery of the property, the appellant made arrangements for a\nspecial meeting of creditors for proof of claims to be\nheld on 5 September\n1991.\nIn the meantime and on 19 July 1991, the respondent realised a part of the\nequipment for R140 955,00. Although not stated expressly\nin the papers, it is\nclear that the realisation was not effected in the manner provided for in ss 83\n(8) and (9) of the Act. Indeed,\nthe appellant became\n9\naware of the sale only some considerable time thereafter. The relevant\nportion of these subsections reads:\n\"(8) The creditor may realize such property in the manner and on the conditions\nfollowing, that is to say -\n(a) ...\n(b)...\n(c)\t...\n(d)\tif it is any other property, the creditor may sell it by public auction\nafter affording the trustee a reasonable opportunity\nto inspect it and after\ngiving such notice of the time and place of the sale as the trustee\ndirected.\n(9) As soon as the trustee has directed a\ncreditor in terms of paragraph (d) of sub-section (8) to give notice of a sale\nby public\nauction, the trustee shall give notice in writing to all the other\ncreditors of the estate in question of the time and place of the\nproposed\nsale.\"\nAt the meeting on 5 September 1991 the respondent's claim was rejected on\ntechnical grounds.\nOn 8 November 1991 the respondent sold the remaining items of equipment for\nR243 524,23. Once again the sale was not effected in\n10\naccordance with the provisions of subsections (8) and (9).\nSome months\nthereafter and in pursuance of s 366 (2) of the Companies Act the Master fixed\n14 May 1992 as the final date for the proof\nof claims. At the meeting of\ncreditors held on that day the respondent's claim was again rejected. The\nmeeting was postponed to 24\nAugust 1992 on which day the claim was yet again\nrejected, apparently because of some defect of a technical nature.\nThe appellant then adopted a new approach. On 8 December 1992 and for some\ninexplicable reason he wrote to the respondent demanding\npayment of the sum of\nR160 000,00 being the amount at which the respondent in its claim lodged on 14\nJune 1991 had valued its security.\nThe demand was ignored by the respondent as\nwere a number of similar demands which the appellant was content to make.\nEventually\na further meeting of creditors for the proof of claims was convened\nfor 20 April\n11\n1993. On that day the meeting was postponed to 17 May 1993. In the meantime\nand on 28 April 1993, the respondent submitted a fresh\nclaim which contained the\ndetails concerning the realisation of the equipment to which reference has been\nmade above. The respondent's\nfresh claim was submitted for proof but still not\naccepted. The meeting was then adjourned to 16 August 1993 when the claim was\nfinally\nproved.\nBut by 5 August 1993 and after having done virtually nothing for a period of\nmore than two years other than write a few letters, the\nappellant was finally\ngalvanised into action. On that day he caused the proceedings to be instituted\nwhich have led to the present\nappeal.\nBefore finally turning to the reasoning of Roux J it is necessary to observe\nthat from the aforegoing it is apparent that the respondent\nfailed to comply\nwith the provisions of s 83 in the following respects: (i) it did not before the\nsecond meeting of creditors give\nnotice in writing to the\n12\nMaster and to the appellant of the fact that it held the equipment as\nsecurity\n(s 83 (1)); (ii) it did not realise the equipment before the second\nmeeting\nof creditors; (iii) when it did realise the equipment, it did so in a\nmanner\nother than as provided for in ss 83 (8) and (9); (iv) it did not prove\nits\nclaim. Section 83 (10), being the section on which the appellant's claim\nis\nfounded, reads:\n\"Whenever a creditor has realized his security as hereinbefore provided he shall\nforthwith pay the net proceeds of the realization\nto the trustee, or if there is\nno trustee, to the Master and thereafter the creditor shall be entitled to\npayment, out of such proceeds,\nof his preferent claim if such claim was proved\nand admitted as provided by section\nforty-four\nand the trustee or the\nMaster is satisfied that the claim was in fact secured by the property so\nrealized. If the trustee disputes\nthe preference, the creditor may either lay\nbefore the Master an objection under section\none hundred and eleven\nto\nthe trustee's account, or apply to court, after notice of motion to the trustee,\nfor an order compelling the trustee to pay him\nforthwith. Upon such application\nthe court may make such order as to it seems just.\"\nThe learned\njudge held in effect that the consequence of the respondent's\nfailure to adhere to the provisions of s 83 was to deprive the appellant\nof\n13\nhis right in terms of s 83 (10) to recover from the respondent the proceeds\nfrom the realisation of the equipment. This somewhat startling\nresult was based\non an interpretation of the phrase \"as hereinbefore provided\" in the subsection\nas requiring strict compliance with\nall the procedural steps set out in the\nearlier subsections of s 83, failing which s 83 (10) would have no application\nand the trustee\nwould be left with no more than the common law remedies to\nvindicate the property from whoever possessed it or to recover its value\nfrom\nthe creditor. I use the word \"startling\" because the construction results in the\nanomaly that a creditor would be able to obtain\nhis release from his statutory\nobligation to pay over to the trustee the proceeds of the realisation by the\nexpedient of failing\nto comply, whether deliberately or otherwise, with one or\nother of the procedural steps set out in the section.\nIn\nBowman NO v De Souza Roldao\n1988 (4) SA 326\n(T)\nthe\n14\nquestion arose whether the liquidator of a company was entitled to\nrecover\nin terms of s 83 (10) of the Act certain debts which had been\ncollected after\nthe liquidation by a creditor who purported to hold the money\nin pursuance\nof a cession of book debts and in circumstances where the creditor, as in\nthe present case, had not complied with the preceding subsections of s\n83.\nKirk-Cohen J dealt with counsel's argument, at 330 H - J, as follows:\n\"Mr Zar submitted that should a creditor, who is given permission to realise an\nasset, not pay over the proceeds, the trustee may\nsue him for the amount\nrealised. I agree that such right is conferred upon the trustee by the\nprovisions of s 83. Mr Zar argued further\nthat, should a creditor not seek\npermission to realise a security, do so, and fail to pay over the proceeds in\nterms of ss (10),\na\nfortiori\nthe trustee has the same right of recovery.\nI find this latter portion of Mr\nZar\n's argument logical and in consonance\nwith the object and wording of the Act. To hold otherwise would stultify the\npowers of the trustee\nI have referred to. It would place a creditor who has\nignored the provisions of the subsection in a better position than one who\nhas\nobtained the required consent to realise the security. The Legislature could\nsurely not have so intended.\"\nAfter observing that the argument\nadvanced by counsel was \"cogent\" the\n15\nlearned judge, however, found it unnecessary to have to decide the\npoint.\nRoux J in the present case referred to the passage quoted above\nand\ndismissed what was said as follows:\n\"Had I heard such an argument I would with respect have rejected it as illogical\nand not founded on any provision in the statute\n...\"\nThis\nobservation was based, however, on the literal interpretation placed by the\nlearned judge on the phrase \"as hereinbefore provided\"\nand which Kirk-Cohen J\nfelt could not have been what was intended by the legislature. Roux J himself\nmade no attempt to resolve the\nobvious anomaly to which his interpretation would\ngive rise.\nThe phrase in question cannot, of course, be considered in\nvacuo\n. On\nits own it is meaningless. It must be read both in the context of the provision\nin which it occurs and together with the preceding\nprovisions to which it\nrefers. In the sentence in which it occurs the legislature is there dealing\nprimarily with what is to be done\nwhen a\n16\ncreditor has realised his security. There is no reference in that sentence or\nelsewhere in the subsection to the failure on the part\nof the creditor to comply\nwith any of the procedural steps detailed in the preceding subsections or the\nconsequences of such a failure.\nWhat immediately strikes one is that had the\nlegislature intended the meaning which the court a quo attributed to the phrase,\nit\nwould be surprising having regard to the far-reaching consequences of such a\nmeaning that the legislature should have expressed itself\nin such an indirect\nand indefinite manner. Had this been the intention one would ordinarily have\nexpected an express provision dealing\nwith the consequences of non-compliance by\nthe creditor with specified procedural steps, rather than a general reference to\nearlier\nprovisions.\nThe interpretation, 1 think, becomes all the more unlikely when the phrase is\nconsidered in the broader context of the Act. The trustee\nis\n17\nthe person burdened with the task of administering and winding up the\ninsolvent estate. In terms of s 20 of the Act the effect of\ninsolvency is to\ndivest the insolvent of his estate and to vest it in the trustee upon the\nlatter's appointment. The trustee, in\nturn, is required in terms of s 69 to take\ninto his possession or under his control all movable property, books and\ndocuments belonging\nto the insolvent. At common law a creditor who held movable\nproperty as security for his claim could not realise it himself. He had\nto\ndeliver it to the trustee who had the right to administer it subject to the\npreference of the creditor in relation to the proceeds\nderived from its\nrealization (see\nNational Bank of South Africa Ltd v Cohen's Trustee\n1911\nAD 235\nat 250). Section 83, however, permits a creditor who holds movable\nproperty as security for his claim, subject to certain limitations,\nto retain\npossession of such property and to realise it himself. But once the property is\nrealised he must pay the proceeds to the\ntrustee. The provisions\n18\nin s 83 (10) requiring him to do so are consistent with the general scheme of\nthe Act and, to the extent that the trustee is entitled\nto receive such\nproceeds, with the common law.\nViewed against this background it could not, I\nthink, have been intended that a creditor by his own non-compliance with the\nprovisions\nof the Act could notionally place himself in a more favourable\nposition vis-àvis the trustee and avoid his statutory obligation\nto pay\nover the proceeds to the trustee. That the trustee may himself have failed\nearlier to recover the property in terms of s 83\n(6) does not detract from the\nobvious anomaly which would result from such a construction. Indeed, the\nnon-compliance by the creditor\nmay occur prior to the second meeting of\ncreditors.\nIn my view, therefore, the reference in the phrase in question to the\npreceding provisions was intended to be no more than a general\nreference to the\nrealisation of securities as contemplated in the earlier\n19\nsubsections of s 83. It was not intended to import into s 83 (10) a\nrequirement of compliance with those subsections as a precondition\nto the\nobligation of the creditor to pay over the proceeds of his security to the\ntrustee.\nIt follows that in my view the court a\nquo\nerred in upholding the\npoint in\nlimine\n.\nI turn now to the two other defences raised in the respondent's answering\npapers and advanced in the heads of argument filed on its\nbehalf. The first was\nthat because certain of the items of earthmoving equipment were never in the\npossession of the appellant the\nprovisions of s 84 (1) did not apply and\nconsequently ownership in respect of those items did not pass to the appellant\nand the provisions\nof s 83 were similarly not applicable. The contention was no\ndoubt inspired by the decision of the Full Court of the Transvaal Provincial\nDivision in\nUPC Bank Ltd v Seacat Leasing and\n20\nFinance Co (Pty) Ltd and Another\n1979(4) SA 682 (T) in which it\nwas\nheld that the provisions of s 84 (1) apply only in cases where the\ntrustee of\nan insolvent estate or the liquidator of a company being wound up\nwas in\npossession of the goods referred to in the section.\nSection 84 (1) reads:\n\"If any property was delivered to a person (hereinafter referred to as the\ndebtor) under a transaction which is an instalment sale\ntransaction contemplated\nin paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of 'instalment sale transaction' in\nsection 1 of the Credit\nAgreements Act, 1980, such a transaction shall be\nregarded on the sequestration of the debtor's estate as creating in favour of\nthe\nother party to the transaction (hereinafter referred to as the creditor) a\nhypothec over that property whereby the amount still due\nto him under the\ntransaction is secured. The trustee of the debtor's insolvent estate shall, if\nrequired by the creditor, deliver\nthe property to him, and thereupon the\ncreditor shall be deemed to be holding that property as security for his claim\nand the provisions\nof section 83 shall apply.\"\nIn\nthe\nUPC Bank\ncase Human J who delivered the judgment\nof the court stated at 694 B - D:\n\"Section 84 (1) contemplates that any steps taken by the creditor\n21\nunder the section shall be taken against the trustee, because the section\nassumes that the trustee is in possession of all the assets,\nor at least\npossibly in the possession of the insolvent.\nSection 84 (1), in my opinion, can only apply in a case where the trustee is in\npossession and then only does the creditor lose his\nrights of ownership. It\ncould never have been in contemplation that he loses both his rights of\nownership as well as his rights in\nterms of s 84 (1) if the trustee is not in\npossession.\"\nIt was accordingly held that because the property in\nquestion was not in the\npossession of the company when it was placed in liquidation, ownership\nhad not passed from the creditor to the liquidator.\nIn\nHubert Davies Water Engineering (Pty) Ltd v The\nBody\nCorporate of \"The Village\" and Others\n1981 (3) SA 97\n(D) Hefer J\ndeclined\nto adopt this interpretation of s 84 (1). At 101 G - H the learned judge\nexplained:\n\"A trustee who does not have possession of the assets of the estate has not\nexercised the right nor indeed carried out the duty which\nhe has in terms of s\n69 (1) of the Act to reduce all the movable property belonging to the estate\ninto his possession or under his\ncontrol. He\n22\nmay exercise that right against anyone in respect of any movable property\nbelonging to the estate, and he may do so specifically\nfor the purpose of being\nable to comply with a demand for delivery of hire-purchase goods in terms of s\n84 (1). There is thus no\nquestion of not being able to comply with such a\ndemand: if the trustee does not have possession, he can and must obtain\nit.\"\nI respectfully agree with the above statement.\nIt is true that s 84 (1) assumes the trustee to be in\npossession.\nBut, as pointed out by Hefer J at 102 E, after referring to a passage in\nthe\njudgment of Solomon J in\nHaak's Garage v Simpson\n1928 (WLD) 185\nat\n187;\n\"... in an insolvency which proceeds normally, the trustee will obviously carry\nout the elementary task of taking possession or control\nof the assets; that he\nwill do so is assumed and that is why, for the purposes of s 84 (1), it is\nassumed that he is in possession\nof the hire-purchase\ngoods.\"\nWith regard to the situation that may arise where the\ntrustee is not in\npossession of the property, the learned judge at\n102 F - G posed and answered the obvious question:\n23\n\"Can he (the trustee), eg, when faced with a demand for delivery in terms of\nthat section (s 84 (1)), in the light of his duty to\nreduce the assets of the\nestate into his possession or control, ever be heard to say simply that he does\nnot possess the property\nwhich the creditor wants him to deliver? Obviously not,\nbecause he will be obliged to carry out his duty, to obtain possession and\nto\ndeliver the property to the creditor.\"\nIn my view the reasoning\nof the learned judge cannot be faulted. I accordingly adopt the decision in the\nHubert Davies\ncase in preference to that in the\nUPC Bank\ncase (see\nalso\nMorgan en 'n Ander v Wessels NO\n1990 (3) SA 57\n(O) at 65 D - G where\nthe\nHubert Davies\ncase was similarly followed in preference to the\nUPC\nBank\ncase).\nIt follows that this defence raised on behalf of the respondent must\nfail.\nThe remaining defence can be disposed of shortly. On behalf of the respondent\nit was contended that in terms of s 83 (10) the obligation\nimposed on a creditor\nto pay over the proceeds of his realised security and\n24\nthe obligation of the trustee to pay the creditor his preferent claim out of\nsuch proceeds were reciprocal obligations; that the respondent\nhad tendered\npayment of the proceeds subject to the applicant undertaking to make reciprocal\npayment, and because such undertaking\nhad not been forthcoming it had been\nentitled to refuse to pay the proceeds to the appellant.\nIn my view, there is no substance in the contention. One need go no further\nthan the provisions of s 83 (10) to see that the respective\nobligations of the\nappellant and the respondent are not reciprocal. The section imposes on the\ncreditor an obligation to pay the\ntrustee the proceeds \"forthwith\" whenever he\nhas realised his security. His entitlement to receive payment out of the\nproceeds arises\n\"thereafter\" and only if certain requirements have been met.\nIt follows that the appeal must succeed.\nCounsel for the appellant drew our attention to the fact that\nthe\n25\ninformation regarding the actual dates upon which the various items of\nearthmoving equipment had been sold, were obtained from annexures\nto the\nrespondent's claim which had not formed part of the papers placed before the\nCourt a quo. He accordingly did not ask for interest\nto run from those dates and\nsuggested instead that it run from 1 December 1991 in view of the allegation\nmade in the respondent's\nanswering affidavit that the equipment had been sold\nduring the period July to November 1991. In the result the following orders\nare\nmade:\n1.\tThe appeal succeeds with costs, such costs to include the costs\nof two\ncounsel.\n2.\tThe order of the Court a\nquo\nis set aside and the\nfollowing\norder is substituted:\n\"(a) The respondent is directed to pay the applicant (i) the sum of R384\n479,23;\n26\n(ii) interest thereon at the rate of 18.5 per cent per annum\nfrom 1 December 1991 to date of payment.\n(b) The respondent is directed to pay the costs of the application, such costs\nto include the costs of two\ncounsel.\"\nD G SCOTT\nJOUBERT JA\nNESTADT JA - Concur\nHARMS JA\nEKSTEEN JA",

    "facts": "The appellant, Gert Hendrik Johan Venter NO, was appointed liquidator of Townsend Plant Hire CC after a provisional winding‑up order was granted in January 1991. The corporation had entered three instalment‑sale agreements with the respondent, Avfin (Pty) Ltd, for earth‑moving equipment. Ownership remained with the respondent until the purchase price was paid. The respondent took possession of the equipment as security but failed to give written notice to the Master and the liquidator as required by s 83(1) of the Insolvency Act, and did not realise the equipment before the second creditors' meeting. When it eventually sold part of the equipment in July 1991 and the remainder in November 1991, the sales were not conducted in accordance with s 83(8)‑(9). The respondent’s claim for the proceeds was repeatedly rejected at creditors’ meetings, leading the liquidator to sue for the proceeds under s 83(10).",
    "issues": "1. Whether the phrase “as hereinbefore provided” in s 83(10) requires strict compliance with all preceding subsections of s 83 before a creditor may retain the proceeds of a realised security. 2. Whether s 84(1) of the Insolvency Act applies where the trustee is not in possession of the hired‑purchase goods. 3. Whether the obligations imposed on the creditor and the trustee under s 83(10) are reciprocal, allowing the creditor to withhold the proceeds pending the trustee’s reciprocal payment.",
    "principles": "The Court considered the interpretation of s 83(10) in light of its legislative purpose and precedent such as Bowman NO v De Souza Roldao, rejecting an overly literal reading that would permit a creditor to escape payment by non‑compliance. It held that “as hereinbefore provided” is a general reference to the realisation provisions, not a pre‑condition. The Court also examined the proper construction of s 84(1), favouring the reasoning in Hubert Davies Water Engineering v The Body Corporate of “The Village” over the earlier UPC Bank decision, confirming that the trustee’s lack of physical possession does not defeat the operation of s 84(1). Finally, the Court noted that s 83(10) imposes a non‑reciprocal duty on the creditor to pay the proceeds forthwith; the creditor’s entitlement to preferment arises only after payment has been made.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court concluded that the respondent’s failure to give notice, to realise the equipment before the second meeting, and to conduct the sales according to s 83(8)‑(9) does not strip the liquidator of the right to recover the proceeds under s 83(10). The defence based on s 84(1) was rejected because the trustee’s duty to obtain possession overrides any argument that ownership never passed. The argument that the obligations were reciprocal was also dismissed as contrary to the statutory wording. Consequently, the respondent was liable to pay the proceeds to the liquidator.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded. The order of the lower court was set aside.
