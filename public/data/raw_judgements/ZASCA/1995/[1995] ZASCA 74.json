The first question is\nwhether they should be. In each the appellant concerned appeals against\nthe\ndismissal of an exception that the respondent's particulars of claim disclosed\nno cause of action. The exceptions were heard\ntogether, and so were the appeals,\nbecause the averments in the particulars of claim and the point in issue in the\nexception were\nessentially the same.\nThe respondent is an urban local authority duly constituted in terms of the\nLocal Government Ordinance, 17 of 1939 (Transvaal). The\ntwo appellants are both\nprivate companies. Each owns an immovable property within the respondent's\nmunicipal jurisdiction, on which\na block of flats had been erected. The\nrespondent supplied the buildings with electricity, water and in the one case\nalso with gas.\nIn each set of particulars of claim it is alleged that\n3\nan agreement had come into existence between the respondent and\nthe\nappellant concerned in terms of which the respondent would\nsupply the\nbuilding with electricity and water (and gas) for which\nthe appellant would\npay the respondent its \"usual charge from time\nto time\"; that the respondent\nduly supplied such commodities \"in\nterms of and pursuant to the agreement\"; and that a balance\n\"calculated at the plaintiff's usual charge from time to time\"\nremained due to the respondent. The particulars of claim, save for\nthe reference to gas, concluded with an identical paragraph:\n\"In the premises and by virtue of the agreement, and the provisions of Local\nGovernment Ordinance No. 17 of 1939, and the provisions\nof the aforementioned\nwater and electricity by-laws the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for\npayment of the aforesaid amounts\nin respect of electricity, water and gas\nsupplied at the property.\"\nThe nub of both exceptions is that the\nagreement as alleged does not conform to the formal and procedural requirements\nof the relevant\nby-laws for the conclusion of such an agreement; and that\n4\nbeing a creature of statute the respondent was in law unable to \"deal with\nthe subject matter in any other way, for example by common\nlaw agreement or\nresolution\". The agreement, being ultra virus the relevant by-laws and\nregulations governing the supply of such\ncommodities to consumers, could not, so\nit was averred, support a claim for payment. The particulars of claim\naccordingly lacked\na sustainable cause of action.\nThe exceptions were heard by Eloff JP in the Witwatersrand Local Division. He\nwas prepared to assume, for the sake of the argument,\nthat the agreements were\nindeed ultra vires. But on the authority of a line of cases (Laing v Caledon\nMunicipality (1909) 19 CTR\n599; Bloemhof Village Council v Calder\n1924 TPD 7\n;\nBarnard v Cilliers\n1929 EDL 106\n; SA Hotels Ltd v City of Cape Town\n1932 CPD 229\n;\nMorland v Niehuas 1973(1) SA 240 (C)) he held that\n\"... where a local authority enters into a contract with a party\n5\nwhich, by reason of legal requirements, is invalid, that party, on being sued\nfor performance under the contract, and who received\nbenefits in consequence\nthereof, cannot be heard to say the contract is invalid.\"\nThe\nparty receiving such benefit, he added, quoting from Dönges\nand Van\nWinsen, Municipal Law (2nd ed. 40), is estopped from\nraising the defence that\nsuch contract or regulation was ultra vires.\nHe concluded:\n\"I have given thought to the question whether a litigant may raise an estoppel\nby way of answer to an exception. The basic rule is\nthat a party wishing to rely\non an estoppel must allege and prove it, (\nBlackie Swart Argitekte v Van\nHeerden\n. 1986(1) SA 249 (AD) at 260 (I-J). I consider however, that it is\nopen to a litigant in the position of the plaintiff\nin casu\nto counter an\neffort by means of an exception to rely on invalidity of a contract, by invoking\nthe equitable remedy of estoppel. I\nbelieve the defendant is estopped from\nrelying on the alleged invalidity of the contracts described in the particulars\nof claim.\"\nIn the result both exceptions were dismissed with\ncosts. Leave to appeal to this court was subsequently granted in both cases\n6\nby the court a quo.\nWhen the matter was called in this court the only question debated, and on\nwhich judgment was reserved, was whether the order made\nwas an appealable\n\"judgment or order\" for purposes of s 20 of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959\n(\"the Act\").\nThis is an issue that has come before this Court not\ninfrequently of late, most notably in Zweni v Minister of Law and Order\n1993 (1)\nSA 523\n(A). (See too Trope and Others v South African Reserve Bank\n[1993] ZASCA 54\n;\n1993 (3) SA\n264\n(A); Caroluskraal Farms (Edms) Bpk v Eerste Nasionale Bank van Suider-Afrika\nBpk\n[1994] ZASCA 23\n;\n1994 (3) SA 407\n(A); Trakman NO v Livshitz and Others\n1995 (1) SA 282\n(A);\nJonas v Krok\n[1994] ZASCA 177\n;\n1995 (1) SA 677\n(A).)\nThe judgment in Zweni's case did not purport to lay down new law. It was an\nattempt to correlate and synthesize the current law in\nthe light of the\namendment to s 20 of Act 59 by s 7 of the Appeals Amendment Act 105 of 1982.\nWhat it does make plain is\n7\nthat the appealability of any decision given during the course of proceedings\nis not contingent solely on the discretion of the trial\njudge in granting leave\nto appeal. To be appealable the decision primarily has to be a \"judgment or\norder\" (532F-G) and a judgment\nor order is a decision with certain attributes,\nthe first of which is that it must be final in effect, that is to say, not\nsusceptible\nof alteration by the court of first instance (532J; 535G). That was\nthe very criterion, before the amendment to s 20 of the Act was\nintroduced, for\ndifferentiating between interlocutory orders appealable as of right and simple\ninterlocutory orders appealable only\nwith leave (cf South Cape Corporation (Pty)\nLtd v Engineering Management Services (Pty) Ltd\n1977 (3) SA 534\n(A) 549G-H;\nSouth African Motor Industry Employers' Association v South African Bank of\nAthens Ltd\n1980 (3) SA 91\n(A) 96H-97A). It follows that the statutory\nreformation notwithstanding past cases still make good law (cf Van Streepen\n& Germs\n(Pty) Ltd v Transvaal\n8\nProvincial Administration 1987(4) SA 569 (A) 584D-E).\nOne such case was Blaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd v Union Government (Minister of\nFinance)\n1915 AD 599.\nThat, like the\npresent, was an appeal brought before this court against the\ndismissal of an exception by the supreme court that a declaration\ndisclosed no cause of action. It was held that the decision, not\nhaving the effect of a final or definitive sentence, was interlocutory\nand hence in order to be appealable required prior leave to appeal.\nAccording to Innes CJ at 601:\n\"... a convenient test was to inquire whether the final word in the suit had\nbeen spoken on the point; or, as put in another way,\nwhether the order made was\nreparable at the final stage. And regarding this matter from that standpoint,\none would say that an order\ndismissing an exception is not the final word in the\nsuit on that point that it may always be repaired at the final stage. All the\nCourt does is to refuse to set aside the declaration; the case proceeds; there\nis nothing to prevent the same law points being re-argued\nat the trial; and\nthough the Court is hardly likely to change its mind there is no legal obstacle\nto its doing so upon a consideration\nof fresh\n9\nargument and further authority.\"\n(See too MBA v .Southern\nInsurance Association Ltd\n1981 (1) SA 122\n(Tsk) 127E-H; Elida Gibbs (Pty) Ltd v\nColgate Palmolive (Pty) Ltd (2)\n1988 (2) SA 360\n(W) 364F-G.)\nCounsel for the appellants conceded that but for two considerations the\nreasoning in the Blaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd case supra was directly\nin point and\nthus conclusive of the present matter.\nThe first consideration mentioned was that Eloff JP in the dictum quoted\nearlier on estoppel made a finding of fact and that this\nfinding was res\njudicata between the parties; hence this case did not fit into the niche of\nBlaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd supra.\nI am unable to agree. Eloff JP was deciding an exception. He heard no\nevidence and consequently could make no findings, let alone\na Ending which bound\nboth the parties and the court itself.\n10\nThe reference in the dictum to estoppel was no doubt an attempt to suggest a\njuristic rationale or analogy for the rule which he extracted\nfrom the cases\ncited and applied to dispose of the exception. It was a theorem about a rule of\nlaw, not a finding about a dispute\nof fact.\nThe second consideration mentioned by counsel for the appellants was that\nthis court in recent years heard and disposed of appeals\nagainst an exception\nbeing dismissed for lack of a cause of action without querying their\nappealability. Examples cited were\n1988 (3) SA 122\n(A) and Proud Investments (Pty) Ltd v Lanchem International\n(Pty) Ltd\n[1991] ZASCA 60\n;\n1991 (3) SA 738\n(A). In neither of these matters was the spectre of\nappealability raised or considered. These cases accordingly cannot serve as\nauthority\nfor the proposition that the present appeals are properly before\ncourt. As was stated in the Blaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd case supra\nat 603:\n11\n\"It has been brought to our notice that on a former occasion an appeal from an\norder dismissing an exception was entertained by this\nDivision without the\nspecial leave of the Court below. The point was apparently overlooked, and the\nmatter dealt with per incuriam;\nthat is no reason for now disregarding what was\nthen unnoticed.\"\nNeither of the considerations mentioned by\ncounsel is convincing. But there is a third consideration which does deserve\nattention.\nIt is a two-fold one. The first aspect of it is that the appellants\nwere anxious to have the law point which is formulated in their\nexceptions\ntested in limine; and the respondent, as indeed the court a quo, co-operated by\nacceding to a procedure which was patently\nirregular. The second aspect is that\nin determining the appealability of a decision the emphasis is on effect rather\nthan on form\n(Zweni v Minister of Law and Order supra 532H-I).\nAs far as form is concerned these exceptions, in a sense, are exceptional.\nFor one thing it would appear as if they were only\n12\ntaken after there had been a full exchange of pleadings, including a\nreplication by the respondent to each appellant's plea. What\nthese pleadings\ncontain one does not know for it was expressly agreed between the parties that\nall the documents except for the particulars\nof claim and the exceptions be\nexcluded from the papers before the court a quo. For another thing the court a\nquo was asked to augment\nthe averments contained in the pleadings before it by\nhaving regard to extraneous material, more particularly the provisions of\ncertain\nby-laws which in the ordinary course would require proof (cf Raad vir\nKuratore vir Warmbad Plase v Bester\n1954 (3) SA 71\n(T); Serobe v Koppies Bantu\nCommunity School Board\n1958 (2) SA 265\n(O); Benator NO v Worcester Court (Pty)\nLtd\n1983 (4) SA 126\n(C)). And finally Eloff JP short-circuited the whole\nprocedure by assuming the correctness of the point taken on exception but\nrefuting\nit with an alien one. The product is a hybrid procedure, part\nexception, part point in limine, part stated case.\n13\nWhat the court a quo, with respect, should have done was to grasp the nettle\nand decide the exception. If it decided instead of assumed\nthat the point was\ngood, the exceptions would have succeeded and the orders granted would doubtless\nhave been appealable (cf Elgin\nBrown & Hamer (Pty) Ltd v Industrial\nMachinery Suppliers (Pty) Ltd\n[1993] ZASCA 55\n;\n1993 (3) SA 424\n(A)). The respondent, failing an\nappeal or an appeal failing, would then have been given leave to amend its\nparticulars of claim\n(cf Group Five Building Ltd v Goverment of the Republic of\nSouth Africa\n[1993] ZASCA 4\n;\n1993 (2) SA 593\n(A) 602C-I). And if it did so by invoking the rule\nrelied on by Eloff JP that would have highlighted the issue whether the rule was\nsound; if so, whether it was akin to estoppel; if so, whether it could be\nassimilated into the respondent's cause of action (cf Union\nGovernment v\nNational Bank of South Africa Ltd\n1921 AD 121\n128); or whether there was not\nperhaps an entirely different rationale for the rule, such as enrichment.\n(Needless to say I\n14\nexpress no view on any of these postulates.) If, on the other hand, the point\ntaken on exception was held to be bad the exceptions\nwould have been dismissed\non that ground and the decisions would not have been appealable, for the reasons\nstated in the Blaauwbosch\nDiamonds Ltd case supra.\nBut matters did not run\nthat course. Even so, and notwithstanding the subversion of the point taken on\nexception and the other procedural\ninnovations mentioned, the present\nproceedings remained, in form, in effect, and in the relief claimed, nothing\nmore than exceptions\nthat were dismissed. Had they been cast as stated cases in\nwhich the parties agreed that if the appellants' point failed judgment\nin an\nagreed sum would be entered in favour of the respondent and if it succeeded the\nrespondent's claim would be dismissed, the\nultimate decision, whichever way it\nwent, would have been \"a judgment or order\" and as such appealable in principle:\nit would have\nbeen final in effect, definitive of the rights of the parties\n15\nand it would have disposed of the relief claimed in the main proceedings (cf\nZweni's case supra 532J-533A). By way of contrast no\nrelief was claimed in this\ncase which would be definitive of the rights of the parties if the exceptions\nshould fail. As such the\npresent proceedings are not comparable to a separately\nadjudicated special plea which, even if dismissed, would dispose of a special\ndefence which is unrelated to the merits of the main proceedings (cf Constantia\nInsurance Co. Ltd v Nohamba\n1986 (3) SA 27\n(A) 35E-36I; Caroluskraal Farms\n(Edms) Bpk v Eerste Nasionale Bank van Suider-Afrika Bpk\n[1994] ZASCA 23\n;\n1994 (3) SA 407\n(A) at\n415B-416D). Nor is this the sort of case where it is incontrovertible on the\npapers that the ultimate relief claimed in the\naction, or a special defence\nwhich will be destructive of such relief (cf Makhoti v Minister of Police\n1981\n(1) SA 69\n(A)), hinges solely on the point taken in the exception. Here, the\nexceptions having been dismissed, the actions are to continue\nto trial. Final\nrelief will only follow if the respondent\n16\nproves the remainder of its cases against the two appellants. For the reasons\nstated in the Blaauwbosch Diamonds Limited judgment\nsupra, the court of first\ninstance would be at liberty if so minded or persuaded to reconsider the issues\nraised in the judgment\nof Eloff JP. His decision was not binding on the parties\ninter se or on the court itself. Whether the court a quo does so or not,\nthe\npoints raised in the exceptions will only become appealable once judgments have\nbeen pronounced one way or the other. In short,\nthe mechanism chosen by the\nappellants and concurred in by the respondent to have the validity of the\nagreements tested as a preliminary\nissue by way of exception, suffers from the\nflaw that it would only have been appealable if the decisions went against the\nrespondent.\nThe appeals must accordingly be struck off the roll. There was some debate\nwhether the respondent, being a party to the abortive procedure\nbefore this\ncourt, should be mulcted in costs. It\n17\nis true that the respondent did not appreciate the significance of\nthe\nnon-appealability of the present proceedings until shortly before\nthe\nhearing of the appeal. But as was rightly pointed out on its behalf\nthe appellants, when the matter was raised, persisted in their\nargument that the appeals were properly before court. Even if the\nrespondent had raised an objection at an earlier stage it does not\nfollow that the appellants would have capitulated. I have not been\npersuaded that there is sufficient reason for departing from the usual\nrule that costs should follow the result.\nEach of the two appeals is struck off the roll with\ncosts\nincluding the costs of two counsel.\nP M Nienaber Judge of Appeal Joubert JA ) Botha JA ) Concur Van den Heever\nJA) Olivier JA )",

    "facts": "The appellants, Wellington Court Shareblock and Agar Properties (Pty) Ltd, each owned a block of flats within the municipal jurisdiction of the City Council of Johannesburg. They claimed that the Council had entered into supply agreements with them for electricity, water and, in one case, gas, and that the Council was entitled to payment of the usual charges. The Council had supplied those utilities and the appellants sought payment. The respondents dismissed the appellants’ exceptions to the particulars of claim on the ground that the alleged agreements were ultra vires the by‑laws governing municipal utilities and therefore could not support a cause of action. The lower court dismissed the exceptions and awarded costs, and leave to appeal was granted.",
    "issues": "The primary issue before the Supreme Court of Appeal was whether the order dismissing the exceptions was a \"judgment or order\" within the meaning of section 20 of the Supreme Court Act and therefore appealable. Ancillary issues involved the effect of estoppel on ultra‑vires municipal contracts and whether the lower court’s reasoning on that point affected appealability.",
    "principles": "The Court examined the definition of a \"judgment or order\" as a decision that is final in effect and not subject to alteration by the court of first instance (citing Zweni v Minister of Law and Order and related authority). It relied on Blaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd v Union Government, which held that dismissal of an exception is interlocutory and requires leave to appeal. The Court also referenced earlier cases on municipal contracts and estoppel (Laing v Caledon Municipality, Bloemhof Village Council v Calder, etc.) to note that estoppel may prevent a municipality from asserting ultra‑vires defence, but such substantive findings do not render the interlocutory order appealable.",
    "application": "Applying the principles, the Court concluded that the order dismissing the exceptions was not final; it did not dispose of the substantive rights of the parties and could be altered at trial. Therefore it did not satisfy the \"final in effect\" requirement for appealability under s 20. The procedural irregularities—such as the hybrid nature of the exception and the reliance on extraneous by‑law provisions—further supported the view that the proceedings remained interlocutory. Consequently, the appeals were not within the jurisdiction of the Court.",
    "conclusion": "Both appeals were struck off the roll. Costs, including the costs of two counsel, were awarded against the appellants."
