The outcome of the appeal depends\nupon\nthe proper interpretation of the policy in question.\nOn 14 December 1990 Leyds applied to Fedgen for insurance in\nrespect of a 1983 Mercedes Benz 280 EA sedan valued at R27 000,00 (\"the\nMercedes\"). At the request of Fedgen, Leyds completed a \"Fedstatus - Application\nForm\" (\"the application\"). In section 7 of the application,\nwhich deals\nspecifically with vehicles, Leyds was asked to \"indicate the scope of cover\"\nrequired. He was given a choice of \"Comprehensive\",\n\"Third Party, Fire and\nTheft\" and \"Third Party only\". He opted for comprehensive cover. In a separate\nsub-section Leyds was required\nto indicate the \"Class of Use\" applicable to the\nMercedes. He selected class 1 out of three available classes. What class 1\ncomprehends\nis not immediately apparent. About half a page further on, however,\nunder a subsection headed specifically \"Class of Use\" the following\nis\nfound\n3\nunder (b):\n\"[T]he individual Classes of Use otherwise cover use for social domestic and\npleasure purposes and in addition for\nClass 1 - Journeys between\nhome and business provided no business calls are made and use for applicants\nbusiness as a farmer\nClass 2 - Business and professional purposes other than insurance and\ncommercial travelling.\"\n(There is no reference to a class 3.) In the original application\nthis particular sub-section has a line ruled through it (which would\nprima facie\nsignify that it does not apply). At the foot of the\napplication there appears a \"Declaration\" which provides in (d):\n\"I have not withheld any material fact and I accept this application and\ndeclaration form the basis of the contract between myself\nand Fedgen Insurance\nLimited.\"\nThe application was signed by Leyds.\nOn 17 December 1990 Fedgen issued a \"Fedstatus Personal Insurance Policy\"\n(\"the policy\") in favour of Leyds. Clauses 2 and\n4\n3 of the Preamble state:\n\"2. SCHEDULE\nThe Schedule - which must be signed on behalf of the\nCompany - indicates\nthe Sections and sub-Sections\nunder which the Policyholder is insured\n3. PAYMENT OF PREMIUM AND OCCURRENCE OF INSURED EVENTS\nIn consideration of the Premium having been paid the Company will indemnify\nthe Policyholder against loss damage death injury or other\nevent giving rise to\na claim under any Insurance Section specified in the Schedule provided such\nevent shall occur during a Period\nof Cover or renewal thereof.\"\nSection 7 of the policy deals with motor vehicle insurance.\nUnder the heading \"SCOPE OF COVER\" the following appears:\n\"The Schedule indicates whether the cover by this Section is Comprehensive\nwhich means that sub-Sections 1 to 3 apply and that sub-Section\n1 covers loss or\ndamage other than (i) damage to tyres except as the result of an accident\ncausing other damage (ii) wear and tear or other depreciation or mechanical\nor\nelectrical breakdowns failures or breakages (iii) consequential loss other\nthan loss of use if specifically\n5\ninsured (iv) theft of motor cycle accessories and spare parts unless the motor\ncycle is stolen at the same time including loss or\ndamage by Malicious Damage as\ndefined by paragraph 7 of the Preamble\nThird Party Fire and Theft\nThird Party only\t\"\nSub-section 1, which appears on the next page\nreads, to the extent\nthat it is relevant:\n\"Each vehicle described in the Schedule (including its accessories and any spare\nparts in or on it) is insured against loss or damage\nin accordance with the\nindicated Scope of Cover.\"\nImmediately below \"SCOPE OF COVER\"\nthere appears:\n\"Description of Use\n1. use for social domestic and pleasure purposes including use by the Insured\nfor journeys between his home and his permanent place\nof business provided that\nbusiness calls are not made on the journey but\nexcluding\nuse in connection with any business or profession the\n6\ncarriage of goods or samples for trade purposes hiring carriage of passengers\nfor hire or carriage of fare-paying passengers commercial\ntravelling driving\ninstruction for reward racing speed or other contests rallies trials or use for\nany purpose in connection with\nthe motor trade\n2. use for social domestic pleasure business and professional purposes\nexcluding\nhiring carriage of passengers for hire or carriage of fare paying passengers\ncommercial travelling driving instruction for reward\nracing speed or other\ncontests rallies trials or use for any purpose in connection with the motor\ntrade.\"\nThe relevant Schedule (\"the Schedule\")\nprovides details of the Mercedes, indicates the \"Scope of Cover\" as\n\"Comprehensive\", fixes\na maximum indemnity of R27 000,00 and provides for a\nbasic premium of R221-44. No reference is made in the Schedule to any applicable\n\"Description of Use\". The only reference thereto is to be found in the \"SPECIFIC\nEXCLUSIONS TO SECTION\n7\nSEVEN AS A WHOLE\" to which I shall revert.\nLeyds is a\ncabinet maker by trade. At the relevant time he owned his own carpentry\nbusiness. It is not in dispute that on 11 February\n1991, during the currency of\nthe policy, Leyds handed over the Mercedes to one Steven Mohlala. Leyds claimed\nin evidence that Mohlala\nwas a friend of his whom he occasionally employed to do\nodd jobs. He testified that Mohlala asked to borrow the Mercedes to go to\na\nfuneral in Harare. Leyds agreed to lend him the Mercedes on condition that it\nwas returned within seven days and that Mohlala would,\nwhile in Harare, collect\nsome samples of wood from a friend of Leyds and bring them back with him. It\nappears from the evidence that\nMohlala never went to Harare, but to Swaziland\nand then to Maputo. He never returned the Mercedes to Leyds, and it ultimately\nbecame\ncommon cause between the parties that he had stolen it. It was this theft\nthat gave rise to Leyds's claim under the policy. Fedgen\nclaims that the\nMercedes,\n8\nat the time it was stolen, was being used for business purposes contrary to\nthe provisions of the policy and that it is accordingly\nentitled to avoid\nliability for Leyds's loss.\nA number of factual and legal issues were debated on appeal in relation to\nFedgen's defence. These included matters such as when did\nMohlala form the\nintention of stealing the Mercedes; for what purpose was it being used, or to be\nused, at the time; whose purpose\ndetermined such use - that of Leyds or that of\nMohlala? However, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion on these issues. In\nmy\nview the appeal can be decided on the basis that, on a proper interpretation\nof the policy, liability on the part of Fedgen exists\nfor the loss resulting\nfrom the theft of the Mercedes irrespective of the purpose for which it was\nbeing used at the time it was\nstolen.\nThe ordinary rules relating to the interpretation of contracts must be\napplied in construing a policy of insurance. A court must therefore\nendeavour to\nascertain the intention of the parties. Such\n9\nintention is, in the first instance, to be gathered from the\nlanguage used which, if clear, must be given effect to. This involves\ngiving the\nwords used their plain, ordinary and popular meaning unless the context\nindicates otherwise\n(Scottish Union & National Insurance Co Ltd v Native\nRecruiting Corporation Ltd\n1934 AD 458\nat 464/5). Any provision which\npurports to place a limitation upon a clearly expressed obligation to indemnify\nmust be restrictively\ninterpreted\n(Auto Protection Insurance Co Ltd v Hanmer\n- Strudwick\n1964(1) SA 349(A) at 354C-D); for it is the insurer's duty to\nmake clear what particular risks it wishes to exclude\n(French Hairdressing\nSaloons Ltd v National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd\n1931 AD 60\nat 65;\nAuto Protection Insurance Co Ltd v Hanmer-Strudwick\n(supra\n) at 354D-E). A policy normally evidences the contract and an\ninsured's obligations, and the extent to which an insurer's liability\nis\nlimited, must be plainly spelt out. In the event of a real ambiguity the\n10\ncontra proferentem\nrule, which requires a written\ndocument to be construed against the person who drew it up, would operate\nagainst Fedgen as drafter\nof the policy\n(Kliptown Clothing Industries (Pty)\nLtd v Marine and Trade Insurance Co of SA Ltd\n1961(1) SA 103 (A) at\n108C).\nWhether the effect of clause (d) of the \"Declaration\" (quoted above) is\nautomatically to incorporate the whole of the application\ninto the contract of\ninsurance between Leyds and Fedgen is a matter open to some doubt. However, I am\nprepared to accept, for the\npurposes of the present appeal, that clause (d) does\nhave that effect. I shall also accept that the sub-section \"Class of Use\",\ndespite\nbeing ruled through, is part of the application. That being so, on a\nproper interpretation of the application Leyds warranted that\nthe Mercedes was\nto be used for social, domestic and pleasure purposes as well as journeys\nbetween home and business, but not for\nbusiness calls or farming.\n11\nIt was always open to Fedgen to decide what cover to grant and\nwhat liability to exempt itself from. Nothing precluded it from granting\nindemnity for loss occasioned by theft irrespective of the circumstances (for,\nafter all, there need not be any correlation between\nuse and theft, as the risk\nof theft would not ordinarily depend upon the purpose for which a vehicle is\nbeing used), while limiting\nliability in the case of collision damage to a\nparticular class of use. The issue is therefore what did the policy cover, for\nLeyds,\nby paying the premium, accepted the cover offered by the policy. The\nanswer depends upon the proper interpretation of the relevant\nprovisions of the\npolicy, having regard to the principles enunciated above.\nClause 3 of the Preamble (quoted above) states in clear terms that Fedgen\nwill indemnify Leyds against loss giving rise to a claim\n\"under any Insurance\nSection specified in the, Schedule ....\" Turning to the Schedule, one finds that\nit applies to motor vehicles\n12\nunder section seven of the policy. In the Schedule the \"Scope\nof Cover\" is given as \"Comprehensive\". On a proper reading of section\nseven\n\"Scope of Cover\" only relates to the three categories \"Comprehensive\", \"Third\nParty Fire and Theft\" and \"Third Party only\".\nIn my view it neither expressly\nnor by necessary implication incorporates \"Description of Use\" which follows\nimmediately upon it.\nConfirmation of this, if required, is to be found in the\napplication where \"Scope of Cover\" clearly relates only to the three categories\nin question. In terms of section seven \"Comprehensive\" means that sub-sections 1\nto 3 apply and that subsection 1 covers \"loss or\ndamage\" other than that\nexcepted (none of which exceptions is of application in the present matter).\nSubsection 1 confirms that the\nvehicle (the Mercedes) is insured against \"loss\nor damage\". No qualification attaches to those words in subsection 1 so they\nmust\nmean (in the context of the present matter)\nall\nloss or damage\n(including theft) subject to the stated exceptions.\n13\nSuch loss or damage is not coupled to any description or limitation\nof\nuse. Nor does the Schedule in any way qualify or limit liability\nwith\nreference to any description of use. On a proper interpretation\nof the policy, and subject only to any restriction on liability\nexpressed elsewhere in the policy, Fedgen would thus be liable to\ncompensate Leyds for the loss of the Mercedes, if stolen,\nirrespective of the purpose for which it was being used immediately\nbefore or at the time of the theft.\nThe position in the present matter should be contrasted with\nthat in\nSamuelson v National Insurance and Guarantee Corp Ltd\n[1986] 3 ALL ER 417(CA).\nThe limitation of use in the policy\nthere under consideration was:\n\"Use only for social, domestic and pleasure purposes EXCLUDING use for hiring\nor in connection with any trade, business or profession.\"\nParagraph l(a)(i) of that policy provided:\n\"The Corporation shall not be liable in respect of 1. any\n14\naccident injury loss or damage occurring whilst any motor vehicle in connection\nwith which insurance is granted under this Policy\nis (a) being used otherwise\nthan in accordance with the 'Limitations as to use' described in the Schedule\n...\"\nIn\nSamuelson's\ncase the \"Limitations as to use\" were\napparently described in the Schedule, and liability for loss (which would\ninclude theft) was\nspecifically coupled to them. That, as I have pointed out, is\nnot the case here.\nFaced with this situation Mr Mullins, who appeared for\nFedgen,\nwas obliged to resort to the exclusionary provision\ncontained in sub-section 3, where the only qualification of liability\nin relation to description of use is to be found. It is headed\n\"SPECIAL EXCLUSIONS TO SECTION SEVEN AS A WHOLE\"\nand provides as follows:\n\"This Section does not insure any loss damage liability medical expenses or\ncompensation\nresulting from an accident\noccurring\n(i) outside the territorial limits of the Republic of South\nAfrica or Lesotho Botswana Swaziland\n15\nNamibia Zimbabwe or any homeland or state formerly within the border of the\nRepublic of South Africa that has been or may in the\nfuture be granted\nindependence by the Republic of South Africa except while the Insured vehicle is\nin transit between any of these\nterritories\n(ii) as the result of the Policyholder being under the influence of intoxicating\nliquor or drugs\n(iii) in connection with the use of any vehicle by the Policyholder or of an\ninsured vehicle by anyone else with the Policyholders\npermission if not properly\nlicensed to drive such vehicle in accordance with the laws of the territory\nconcerned but this exclusion\nshall not apply if any law or regulation applicable\nto learner drivers is being observed or if the licence is not valid at the time\npurely because of a failure to renew it provided that the driver concerned has\nheld a valid renewable licence and is not disqualified\nfrom renewing\nit\n(iv)\nin connection with the use of an insured vehicle by\nthe Policyholder or by any one else with his or her permission otherwise than\nin\naccordance with the description of use\n16\n(v) while the vehicle involved is being used with the Policyholders permission\nby anyone known by him/her to be under the influence\nof intoxicating liquor or\ndrugs.\" (My emphasis.)\nThis\nexclusionary provision only applies to loss, damage, etc resulting from \"an\naccident\". No reference is made to theft. In order\nto bring the present matter\nwithin the exclusionary provision Mr Mullins was compelled to argue that an\n\"accident\", in the context\nin which that word is used, includes theft. There are\ncogent arguments against this being so.\nAs a perusal of Stroud's Judicial Dictionary : 5th Ed : pages 18-22 will\nshow, the word \"accident\" is one of very wide definition.\nIts meaning depends to\na large extent upon the precise context in which it is used. The Concise Oxford\nDictionary : 6th Ed, defines\n\"accident\",\ninter alia\n, as \"1. Event that is\nwithout apparent cause or unexpected .... 2. Unintentional act, chance,\nmisfortune; unlucky event, esp. one\ncausing injury or damage\". Black's Law\n17\nDictionary :5th Ed, at 14 defines \"accident\", in relation to accident\ninsurance policies, as \"a more comprehensive term than 'negligence',\nand in its\ncommon signification the word means an unexpected happening without intention or\ndesign\" (cf\nFenton v J Thorley & Co Limited\n1903 AC 443\n(HL) at 453).\nIt follows that an accident does not encompass a deliberate act causing loss or\ndamage (cf\nGriessel NO v SA Myn en Algemene Assuransie Edms Bpk\n1952(4)\nSA 473(1) at 477H). Given that theft is an intentional act it would not fall\nwithin the ordinary and popular meaning of \"accident\".\nThe context within which the word \"accident\" appears also militates against\nan interpretation which includes theft. The terms of the\nexclusionary provision\n(especially (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)) strongly suggest that the word \"accident\"\nrefers to a collision or\nan event arising from, or directly related to, the\ndriving of a motor vehicle.\n18\nIn any event, at best for Fedgen the word is ambiguous. In keeping with the\nrelevant principles of interpretation, it falls to be\ninterpreted against\nFedgen, within whose power it lay, as drafter of the policy, to make its meaning\nclear. It must therefore be\nconstrued not to apply to theft. This renders it\nunnecessary to consider whether the Mercedes, when it was stolen, was being used\n\"otherwise than in accordance with the description of use\" in terms of (iv) of\nthe exclusionary provision. Fedgen's liability to\nindemnify Leyds for the theft\nof the Mercedes was not linked to any limitation of use or otherwise excluded\nunder the provisions\nof the policy. Leyds was accordingly legally entitled to be\nindemnified by Fedgen for his loss arising from the theft of the Mercedes.\nAt the commencement of the trial the parties agreed that the value of the\nMercedes at the time it was stolen was R25 500,00 and that,\nif held liable under\nthe policy, Fedgen would compensate Leyds in that amount subject to any amounts\nwhich fell to be\n19\ndeducted in terms of the \"Table of Deductibles\" (\"the Table\")\nwhich forms\npart of the policy. Leyds conceded that an amount of\nR300,00 fell to be\ndeducted. The only remaining issue was\nwhether there should be a further deduction in terms of clause 2(vi)\nof\nthe Table. The learned trial judge held that Fedgen was not\nentitled to any further deduction. He accordingly awarded Leyds\nthe sum of R25 200,00.\nClause 2(vi) of the Table provides for a deduction equal to\n\"10%\nof the gross claim with a minimum of R400\" in respect of\n\"loss or damage caused by or resulting from theft or attempted theft\nof the insured vehicle unless fitted with an anti-theft device\napproved by the Company ....\" At the time of the theft the\nMercedes was not fitted with an anti-theft device of any description.\nThis emerges clearly from the following passage in the evidence of\nLeyds under cross-examination:\n\"Dalk kan u dan behulpsaam wees om te se, was hierdie Mercedes Benz met 'n\nteendiefstalmiddel voorsien?\n20\nNee, nie op daardie stadium nie.\nEn op 11 Februarie 1991, toe mnr Mohlala uit die erf uitry met die Mercedes, net\ndit op daardie stadium 'n teendiefstalmeganisme\nopgehad? —\nNee.\"\nThe preconditions for the application of clause 2(vi) are\ntherefore present - loss resulting from theft and the absence of an anti-theft\ndevice. On the clear wording of clause 2(vi) Fedgen was entitled to the\ndeduction of a further R2 550,00 i.e. 10% of the agreed value\nof the Mercedes,\nwhich constituted the gross claim. The amount awarded to Leyds therefore falls\nto be reduced to R22 650,00, and\nthe appeal succeeds to that extent.\nThe only remaining issue relates to the costs of appeal. In view of the\nreduction in the amount to be paid by it Fedgen has enjoyed\nsome (albeit very\nlimited) success on appeal. However, such success can hardly be termed\nsubstantial. Fedgen failed on the main issue\nto which most of the time on\nappeal, and virtually the whole trial, was devoted. In fact, the only evidence\nrelevant\n21\nto the further deduction issue was that of Leyds quoted above;\nand\nno more than about ten minutes in all was spent on appeal debating\nthe\nmatter. It may well be that had Fedgen confined its appeal to\nthe deduction\nissue, Leyds would have conceded the point. Be that\nas it may, the measure of\nFedgen's success does not justify it being\nawarded any of its costs of appeal. Indeed it was Leyds who, by\nsuccessfully contesting what was by far the major issue on appeal,\nenjoyed substantial success. This entitles him to at least the bulk\nof his costs. The costs order, however, should reflect some\nrecognition of Fedgen's limited success, so that it should not be\nordered to pay all Leyds's costs of appeal. In all the circumstances\nit would be appropriate to order Fedgen to pay 90% of such costs.\nIn the result the following order is made:\n1. The appeal succeeds to the limited extent that the amount awarded by the\ntrial Court is reduced from R25 200,00 to R22 650,00.\nThe remaining orders of\nthat Court stand.\n22\n2. The appellant is ordered to pay 90% of the respondent's costs of\nappeal.\nJ W SMALBERGER JUDGE OF\nAPPEAL\nHefer, JA) FH Grosskopf, JA) Nienaber, JA) concur Van den Heever, JA )",

    "facts": "Peter Ronald Leyds insured a 1983 Mercedes Benz 280 EA sedan for R27,000 under a comprehensive motor vehicle policy issued by Fedgen Insurance Limited. Leyds selected \"Class 1\" use, which was limited to social, domestic and pleasure purposes and journeys between home and business, without business calls or farming. In February 1991 Leyds lent the car to a friend, Steven Mohlala, who was to use it for a funeral trip but instead travelled to Swaziland and Maputo and never returned the vehicle. The car was subsequently stolen. Leyds claimed the loss under his policy; Fedgen contested liability, arguing the car was being used for business purposes contrary to the policy’s use restrictions.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the comprehensive cover in the policy indemnifies loss from theft irrespective of the vehicle’s purpose at the time of the loss. 2. How the \"Description of Use\" and the class of use selected by Leyds affect coverage for theft. 3. Whether the exclusion clause referring to \"accident\" in Section 7 sub‑section 3 extends to theft. 4. Whether Fedgen is entitled to apply the deduction under Table clause 2(vi) (10% of the claim) for theft where no anti‑theft device was fitted.",
    "principles": "The court applied standard contract‑interpretation rules for insurance policies: give words their plain, ordinary meaning; interpret limitations narrowly; apply contra proferentem against the drafter of the policy; exclusions must be clear and unambiguous. An \"accident\" is understood as an unexpected, unintentional event and does not include intentional acts such as theft. The policy’s comprehensive cover, as defined, includes loss or damage (including theft) unless expressly excluded. Table deductions must be applied according to their clear wording.",
    "application": "The judge held that the policy’s \"Comprehensive\" scope expressly covers loss or damage, including theft, and that the \"Description of Use\" provisions do not limit liability for theft. The exclusion in sub‑section 3 is limited to loss arising from an \"accident\" and therefore does not apply to intentional theft. Consequently Fedgen could not rely on the exclusion to avoid liability. The Table clause 2(vi) was clear: a 10% deduction applies to theft losses when no approved anti‑theft device is fitted. The Mercedes had no such device, so a deduction of R2,550 (10% of the R25,500 valuation) was proper, reducing the award to R22,650. Regarding costs, Fedgen’s limited success did not merit full costs; he was ordered to pay 90% of Leyds’s appeal costs.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded in part. The amount awarded to Leyds was reduced from R25,200 to R22,650 to reflect the 10% Table deduction for theft without an anti‑theft device. Fedgen was ordered to pay 90% of the respondent’s costs of appeal. All other orders of the trial court remained in force."
