That\nventure was the product of a catenation of agreements\nof which two, one entered\ninto in 1980 and the other in 1985, are central to this litigation. Clause 2 of\nthe 1985 agreement which\nis headed \"Recordal and agreement\" reads:\n\"2.1 The parties record\nthat:\n2.1.1\nthey\nare all intimately involved in the business of printing and\npublishing;\n2.1.2\nthey have all acquired and\nwill acquire considerable expertise in the business of printing and\npublishing;\n2.1.3\nCaxton, Afmed, Modern Media,\nHortrio and Horpak [the appellant by its former name] are all closely associated\nwith The Argus [the\nfirst respondent] and its subsidiary and associated\ncompanies;\n2.1.4\nMoolman [the second\nappellant] and Coburn [the third appellant] are the joint managing directors of\nCaxton and Short [the fourth appellant]\nis the chairman of\nCaxton.\n2.2 For these reasons the parties agree that it is fair and reasonably necessary\nfor the protection of their business and proprietary\ninterests that they should\nbe restrained from competing with each other in respect of the undermentioned\nactivities for a reasonable\nperiod.\"\n3\nThe issue in this litigation, brought by way of notice of motion, is whether\nthe publishing restraints which are contained in both\nthe 1980 and the 1985\nagreements in substantially similar terms and which purport to bind the first\nrespondent in favour of the appellants\nand certain other parties, are\nenforceable at the instance of the appellants. The Court a quo (Goldstein J\nsitting in the Witwatersrand\nLocal Division) decided that issue in favour of the\nrespondents. This is an appeal, with leave of the Court a quo, against that\nEnding.\nThe second respondent was not a party to either of the agreements but\nit was common cause that in 1988 it assumed all the rights and\nobligations of\nthe first respondent under both agreements. The second respondent is described\nin the papers as the wholly owned chief\noperating subsidiary of the first\nrespondent. For purposes of this litigation nothing hinges on the separate\ncorporate identities\nof the two respondents and I shall henceforth refer to them\nsimply as the respondents, even in respect of events preceding 1988.\nThe\nrespondents published nespapers. They had an indirect interest\n4\nin the Sunday Times, a weekly newspaper sold nationwide. They published The\nStar, a daily newspaper sold and circulating mainly in\nwhat was then known as\nthe PWV region, the Cape Argus, sold and circulating mainly in the Cape\nPeninsula, and the Sunday Tribune\nand the Natal Daily News, respectively a\nweekly and a daily newspaper, sold and circulating mainly in the Durban\narea.\nCaxton Ltd (\"Caxton\"), in which the second and third appellants were\nboth substantial shareholders and directors, was the proprietor,\nprinter and\ndistributor of an assortment of publications described in the affidavits as\n\"knock and drop\" free sheets. These are publications\nin tabloid form consisting\nchiefly of advertising, but containing also news items and features relating to\nspecific areas or suburbs,\nwhich were distributed free of charge in those areas,\nmainly by leaving them in private post boxes. There was a network of these\npublications throughout South Africa and Namibia. Caxton also published what are\ndescribed in the appellants' affidavits as \"local\nnewspapers\". These were also\ntargeted at specific localities but were\n5\ndistributed and sold in the ordinary course. The Sandton Chronicle was\nreferred to as a specific example. Caxton's main source of\nrevenue from both\ntypes of publications came from advertising.\nSome time before 1980 the\nrespondents resolved to increase their participation in that sector of the\nadvertising market. This was\naccomplished through an intricate series of\nmanoeuvres, recorded in the 1980 agreement, involving the sale and exchange of\nshares\nin various companies, including Caxton, the outcome of which, somewhat\nsimplified, was that the second, third and fourth appellants\nand the first\nrespondent became shareholders in a company, Afmed (Pty) Ltd (\"Afmed\"). Afmed\nbecame the holding company of Caxton.\nThe respondents thus acquired, through the\nfirst respondent's shareholding in Afmed, a substantial interest in Caxton's\nbusiness.\nThe 1980 agreement contained reciprocal restraints, the overall\npurpose of which was to preserve, for each of the parties vis-à-vis\nthe\nothers, their separate spheres of operation within the Geld of printing,\npublishing and distributing newspapers.\n6\nClause 16 of the 1980 agreement provides in\nparticular:\n\"16.5 ARGUS undertakes and warrants that it shall not itself or through any\ncompany controlled by it or through any third party except\nwith the written\nconsent of M&C [second and third appellants respectively] and AP\n[Amalgamated Press (Pty) Ltd] -\n16.6\tPublish a separate free newspaper (i.e. a newspaper for which the recipient\ndoes not pay) anywhere in the Republic of South\nAfrica or South West Africa;\nor\n16.7\tPublish a local newspaper in the areas presently described as the\nmagisterial districts of Germiston, Elsburg, Boksburg, Benoni,\n(including Petit\nand Brentwood Park), Brakpan, Springs, Florida, Sasolburg, Meyerton,\nVanderbijlpark and Vereeniging, Roodepoort,\nKrugersdorp and Randfontein\nPROVIDED however that all the provisions of this Clause and its sub-clauses\nshall not be interpreted as a restraint on the ARGUS\npublishing a national or\nregional daily newspaper, or a national or regional weekly newspaper, provided\nthat such regional newspaper\ndoes not circulate only or mainly in the areas\ndescribed above in clause 16.7.\"\nThe restraints, it\nis to be noted, are not limited in time. During the period 1980 to 1985 Caxton\ncontinued to publish its free sheets\nand, in the areas demarcated in clause 16.7\nof the 1980 agreement, its\n7\nlocal newspapers. There were some exchanges between some of the parties about\nsome of the respondents' publishing activities but in\ngeneral the respondents\nadhered to the restraints.\nEarly in 1985 there was, once more, a\nrearrangement of the corporate kaleidoscope. Caxton sold its business to a\ncompany Hortors Trio\nRand Limited (\"Hortors Trio\") \"for the benefit of its\nwholly owned subsidiary, Horpak ...\". Horpak subsequently changed its name\nto\nCTP Limited. CTP Limited is the first appellant. Its business operations are\nadministered by the second and third appellants.\nThe second, third and fourth\nappellants have substantial equity stakes in the business of the first\nappellant. The first respondent,\nthrough its shareholding in various other\ncompanies, acquired control of 50% of the equity in the first appellant.\nSome\nof these developments are reflected in the 1985 agreement. The second and third\nappellants as well as Afmed and the first respondent\nwho were all parties to the\n1980 agreement were again signatories to the new agreement. Some of the other\noriginal parties did not,\nhowever, survive the\n8\ntransition. The first and fourth appellants as well as Caxton and Hortors\nTrio were introduced as new parties.\nClauses 1.2 and 1.3 of the 1985 agreement read as\nfollows:\n\"1.2 In terms of an Agreement between Moolman [the second appellant], Coburn\n[the third appellant], The Argus [the respondents] and\nvarious other parties\ndated January 17, 1980, Amalgamated, Moolman and Cobum have given certain\nrestraints to The Argus and The Argus\nhas given certain restraints to Moolman\nand Cobum.\n1.3 The parties wish to extend these restraints in the manner set out\nbelow.\"\nClause 2 of the 1985 agreement has been\nquoted at the beginning of this judgment.\nClause 3.1, recording the restraints on the second, third and\nfourth\nappellants, reads:\n\"3.1 Moolman, Cobum and Short each undertake that they shall not either\nthemselves or through any company or otherwise except with\nthe written consent\nof The Argus -\n3.1.2 publish a national or regional daily or national weekly newspaper in the\nRepublic of South Africa as it was\nconstituted\n9\non May 31, 1961, or in South West Africa/Namibia. 3.2 The restraints contained\nin 3.1 shall apply individually to Moolman, Coburn\nand Short from the effective\ndate until 5 years after the date on which each of them ceases to be employed by\nCaxton, Hortrio or\nHorpak or ceases to be a shareholder of Caxton, Modern Media\nor Afmed, whichever is the later.\"\nClause 4 contains a similar restraint on Caxton, Armed,\nModern\nMedia, Hortrio and the first appellant in favour of the\nfirst respondent.\nThe crucial clause is clause 5. It reads:\n\"5.\nRestraint on the\nArgus\n5.1 Subject to the provisions of 5.2, The Argus undertakes to each of the other\nparties that it shall not from the effective date,\nwithout the written consent\nof the other parties, be interested or engaged, whether directly or indirectly\nand whether as proprietor,\npartner, shareholder or otherwise, in any company,\npartnership, firm, business venture or undertaking which carries on the activity\nof publishing a separate free newspaper (i.e. a newspaper for which the\nrecipient does not pay), a local newspaper or a magazine,\nanywhere in the\nRepublic of South Africa as it was constituted on May 31, 1961 or in South West\nAfrica/Namibia or elsewhere, or from\ncontinuing any business activity or\nundertaking being carried on by\nThe\n10\nArgus or any of its subsidiaries at the effective date. 5.2 The restraints\ncontained in this clause shall not restrain The Argus from\npublishing a national\nor regional daily newspaper, or a national or regional weekly newspaper,\nanywhere in the Republic of South\nAfrica as it was constituted on May 31, or in\nSouth West Africa/Namibia, or elsewhere, or from continuing or recommencing any\nbusiness\nactivity or undertaking being carried on by The Argus or any of its\nsubsidiary companies at the effective date.\"\nClause 5 of the 1985 agreement is wider in scope than clause 16 of the 1980\nagreement. It reincorporates the restraint on the publishing\nof \"separate free\nnewspapers\" and broadens the restraint on the publishing of \"local newspapers\"\nto cover the entire country instead\nof certain designated areas only. But the\nparties to the two agreements were not the same. The later restraint accordingly\ndid not\ndisplace or novate the earlier one. Either could support a claim for\nrelief.\nDuring 1990 to 1991 the respondents embarked on a new series of publications\nwith the cognomen \"Focus\". These were to be distributed\nin conjunction with The\nStar on a regular monthly basis. In May 1991 the\n11\nrespondents distributed to potential advertisers a promotional letter\nadvising\nthem that:\n\"Over the years, The Star has regularly been asked to bring out special area\nguides to focus on certain areas and allow local advertisers\nto reach a\nspecifically targeted area. Until now the choice of advertising medium in\nSandton has been limited to local Caxton papers.\"\nDuring July\n1991 the following report appeared in the Argus News, an in-\nhouse publication which was circulated to all Argus employees:\n\"June saw the launch of five regional supplements to The Star, which will\nhopefully attract advertising from smaller retailers who\ncannot afford to\nadvertise in the constantly growing newspaper ... [t]here has been an\nenthusiastic reaction from advertisers to\nthe Western Focus, Northern Focus,\nEastern Focus, Southern Focus and Focus on Sandton. The copy for these\nCaxton-like supplements\nis being written by editorial staffers on a free-lance\nbasis ... The regional supplements are competition for the Caxton 'knock and\ndrops' ... and retailers are pleased with being offered an alternative ...\nSupplements are obviously sent only to the region that\neach covers. For example,\nthe Northern Focus goes only to the northern suburbs, and the Eastern Focus only\nto Edenvale, Bedford View,\nGermiston, Kempton Park, etc.\"\nIn the\nedition of The Star of 31 July 1991 a paragraph appeared which\n12 advised readers that copies of the Northern Focus could be obtained from\nThe Star newspaper itself at its address at Sauer Street,\nJohannesburg if it was\nnot distributed in their area. A similar notice also appeared in the newspaper\nof 28 August 1991. That issue\nalso contained an advertising extract which, inter\nalia, read:\n\"June 1991 saw the launch of five Regional newspapers to The Star. This has\noffered local retailers the opportunity of low cost advertising\ndirected at a\nspecific geographical area. Regional newspapers carried by SA's largest daily\npaper give credibility and offers an\nalternative to local free sheet\nnewspapers.\"\nDuring this period different editions of The Star\nincluded different inserts being the Northern Focus, Eastern Focus, Western\nFocus,\nSouthern Focus and Sandton Focus. Each \"Focus\" was separately paginated\nand contained, in tabloid form, news, features, and advertising\npertaining to\nits particular area of distribution.\nThese events prompted the appellants,\nthrough their attorneys, to address a letter dated 2 September 1991 to the\nrespondents demanding\nan\n13\nundertaking that the respondents \"immediately desist from publishing any\nand\nall of the newspapers referred to ... or any similar type newspapers\",\nfailing\nwhich they would move for an urgent interdict. In reply the respondents'\nattorneys disputed that the inserts were\n\"either local newspapers or separate free newspapers, as claimed by you. The\npublications are supplements to copies of The Star newspaper\nwhich are delivered\nor sold in specific geographic areas\".\nIt was accordingly denied\nthat \"its action in publishing regional supplements\nis unlawful or in breach\nof the restraint agreement\". The undertaking sought\nwas refused but a\nconcession was nevertheless made in these terms:\n\"Notwithstanding the above, and in view of the close relationship which exists\nbetween your client and ours, our client will not,\nwithout prejudice to its\nrights, make the supplements available separately and free of charge to readers\nat any CNA branches in Johannesburg.\"\nThereafter different\neditions of Focus continued to be distributed in different areas as insertions\nin The Star. In the \"Northern\nStar\" of 12 September 1991, a copy of which had\nbeen made available to this Court, the following notice to readers appears:\n14\n\"\nNorthern Star is at your service\n. There will be five new Stars in the\nfirmament by the end of this month. The first was the Sandton Star, which\nlaunched the cluster\nof 'stars' which will be appearing regularly in the suburbs\nfrom now on. Now readers in the northern areas will have their own 'Northern\nStar' twice a month.\nWe hope that the Northern Star, and the other regional Stars (Sandton, Southern,\nEastern and Western), will reflect the views of\nthe community. We want you to\ntalk to us and let us know what you think. We will try to see things from your\nangle rather than from\nSauer Street\".\nAccording to this\nannouncement it was envisaged that each Focus might\nadopt its own distinctive\napproach, not necessarily in conformity with that\nof the main paper.\nThe threat of litigation led to protracted negotiations between\nthe\nparties in an endeavour to resolve this internecine dispute\nbut all efforts\nultimately proved to be unsuccessful and the present\nproceedings ensued.\nIn it the appellants, as applicants, sought an order in paragraph 1 of\nthe\nNotice of Motion that the respondents\n\"be interdicted and restrained from directly or indirectly publishing: 1.1 a\nseparate free newspaper (i.e. a newspaper for which\nthe recipient does not pay)\nanywhere in the Republic of\nSouth\n15\nAfrica/Namibia;\n1.2 a local newspaper\nanywhere in the Republic of South\nAfrica/Namibia,\nother than with the prior written\nconsent of the Applicants\";\nand in paragraph 2, an interdict against the publication of the\n\"'Southern Star/Focus', the 'Sandton Star', the 'Eastern Star/Focus', the\n'Northern Star/Focus' and the 'Western Star/Focus', either\ntogether with or\nseparately from The Star newspaper\".\nIn each case the interdict\nsought is unlimited in point of time.\nOn behalf of the respondents it was\ncontended that the appellants were not entitled to the relief sought:\n1.\tbecause the restraints, if to endure in perpetuity, would be void for\noffending against public policy; and if to endure for a\nreasonable time, would\nbe void for vagueness;\n2.\tbecause the Focus inserts were not (i) newspapers which were (ii) separate or\n(iii) free or (iv) local.\nI deal in turn with each\nof these contentions.\n16\nThe duration of the restraints\nThe 1980 restraint was silent as to its duration. As such it is\nindefinite.\nWhether the 1985 restraint is likewise indefinite depends on how\nclause 2.2 thereof, quoted at the outset of this judgment, is to\nbe construed.\nIt refers to \"a reasonable period\". Is that a term of the agreement? Or is the\nclause merely a preamble, a declaration\nof how the parties themselves view the\nrespective restraints imposed upon them in the clauses to follow? If it is a\nterm it would\nmean that the restraint, by agreement, is to endure for a\nreasonable time. Then the issue would arise whether such a term is either\nenforceable or void for vagueness.\nIn my opinion clause 2.2 was not intended\nas a term in the sense referred to in Design and Planning Service v Kruger\n1974\n(1) SA 689\n(T) 695C-F i.e. as a contractual provision constituting an\nobligation. It is no more than a recordal, as its caption indicates, that\nthe\nparties acknowledge in advance that the terms referred to in the body of the\nagreement will not\n17\nbe open to attack as being unreasonable. (The weight which may be\naccorded to such an acknowledgement is not now germane (cf Magna Alloys\nand Research (SA) (Pty) Ltd v Ellis\n[1984] ZASCA 116\n;\n1984 (4) SA 874(A)\n905B-C; Basson\nv Chilwan and Others\n[1993] ZASCA 61\n;\n1993 (3) SA 742\n(A) 767J-768E)). That clause 2.2\nis introductory and not declaratory also appears from the body of the\nagreement where a distinction is drawn between restraints imposed\non\nindividuals (such as the second, third and fourth appellants) and\nrestraints\nimposed on corporations (such as the first appellant and the first\nrespondent.)\nIn the one category the restraints are limited in time, in the\nother not. So,\nfor instance, clause 3.2 binds the second, third and fourth appellants\n\"from the effective date until 5 years after the date on which each of them\nceases to be employed by Caxton, Hortrio or Horpak or\nceases to be a shareholder\nof Caxton, Modem Media or Afmed, whichever is the later\".\nClauses\n4 and 5, by way of contrast, contain no similar limitation when it comes to the\nfirst appellant or the first respondent. The\nimplication is that the first\nappellant and the first respondent are bound by their respective\n18\nrestraints for an indefinite and not merely a reasonable period. Properly\nconstrued, clause 2.2 does not therefore mean that the restraints\nare to persist\nonly for a reasonable time; and that being so it is not necessary to examine the\nsubsidiary question whether a term\nto that effect would be void for\nvagueness.\nIt was next argued on behalf of the respondents that a restraint\nfor an indefinite period is so far-reaching as perforce to clash\nwith public\npolicy. I disagree. The cases both here and in England suggest the contrary.\n(See, for instance, for South Africa, Wilkinson\nand Another v Wiggill\n1939 NPD\n4\n, 16; Vermeulen v Smit\n1946 TPD 219\n, 222; Weinberg v Mervis\n1953 (3) SA 863\n(C), 870H-871A; Wohlman v Buron\n1970 (2) SA 760\n(C), 763D-F; and, for England,\nArcher and Others v Marsh (1837) 6 Ad&E 959\n[1837] EngR 9\n; ,\n112 ER 366\n; Connors Brothers\nLtd and Others v Connors\n[1940] 4 All ER 179\n(PC), 195.) A restraint would be\nadverse to public policy if its enforcement would be contrary to the public\ninterest. It would most\nlikely be contrary to the public interest if\nunreasonable (Magna Alloys and\n19\nResearch (SA) (Pty) Ltd v Ellis supra 898A-B). It would be unreasonable if\nand to the extent that it does not seek to protect a legitimate\ninterest of the\none party; or if it does purport to protect an interest, such interest is\neclipsed by the interest of the other party\nnot to be so restrained (cf Basson v\nChilwan and Others supra 767G-I).\nWhether a restraint is in conflict with the\npublic interest is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances prevailing\nat the\ntime when it is sought to be enforced (Magna Alloys and Research (SA)\n(Pty) Ltd v Ellis supra 898D). In the instant case the various\nrestraints were\nreciprocal ones. They were agreed to between the parties concerned as part of\nthe consideration for the restructuring\nof their respective businesses. Their\npurpose was to preserve the commercial status quo. Each side sacrificed part of\nits own competitive\nedge as a hedge against attack from the other. Where the\nrestraints formed part of the overall consideration and were designed to\nprotect\ncomparable interests of the respective sides, they cannot be said to be mere\ncovenants against competition and as such to\nrun contrary\n20\nto the public interest.\nThe two sets of parties, although business\nassociates, were nevertheless in competition on opposite sides of the same line\nof business.\nThe purpose of the reciprocal restraints was to define each side's\nterritory. Although the restraints binding the respondents are\nindefinite, the\nappellants conceded in argument that this purpose would be served only while the\nparties continued to conduct their\nrespective businesses in association with\neach other; differently stated, that their protectable interest would only last\nfor as\nlong as they remained so affiliated. In turn, the respondents conceded in\nargument that as matters stood at the time when the Court\na quo considered them,\nit could not be contended that the appellants lacked an interest worthy of\nprotection. (Different considerations\nmay of course apply if circumstances\nshould in future change.)\nIn short, the restraints, ostensibly indefinite in\ntime, will not necessarily operate in perpetuity; and judged on the strength of\nthe interests served by the restraints at the time when their enforcement was\nsought,\n21\ncannot be said to be against the public interest and as such at variance\nwith\npublic policy.\nWhether the Focus inserts were \"newspapers\"\nOn behalf of the respondents it was argued that the Focus\ninserts\ndistributed as part of The Star were not \"newspapers\"\nbecause they had not\nbeen registered as such in terms of the Newspaper\nRegistration Act, 63 of\n1971. The contention is formulated in the following terms in\nthe\nrespondents' answering affidavit:\n\"[t]he representatives of each of the parties knew and accepted that the term\n'newspaper' would bear its ordinary grammatical meaning\nin the industry\nand that to qualify as a newspaper such publication would require registration\nin terms of the Act. The term 'newspaper' did not\nand was not intended to extend\nto regional supplements in their present form.\" (My\nunderlining)\nRegistration is not part of the ordinary meaning of\n\"newspaper\". The Oxford English Dictionary (1933 edition), for instance, defines\nit as\n\"a printed, now usually daily or weekly, publication containing the news,\ncommonly with the addition of advertisements and other\nmatters of\ninterest\".\n22\nThe Act itself, incidentally, defines a newspaper as\n\"a periodical publication published at intervals not exceeding one month and\nconsisting wholly or for the greater part of political\nor other news or of\narticles relating thereto or to other current topics, with or without\nadvertisements, and with or without illustrations,\nbut does not include any\npublication not intended for public sale or public\ndissemination\".\nIn terms of this definition the Focus inserts are\nnewspapers.\nIf the underlined phrase \"in the industry\" in the passage cited\nfrom the respondents' answering affidavit was intended to suggest\nthat the\nparties had a special or technical meaning in mind, the suggestion must fail for\nlack of any evidence to support it (cf\nRichter v Bloemfontein Town Council\n1922\nAD 57\n, 70).\nIn my opinion it cannot be said that the inserts were not\nnewspapers for purposes of the two agreements.\nWhether the Focus inserts were\n\"separate\"\nAccording to the appellants the Focus inserts although\nenfolded in and distributed as part of The Star were nevertheless \"separate\nnewspapers\";\n23\naccording to the respondents they were merely supplements to The Star and\nhence not separate. The Court a quo held that they were\nnot separate inasmuch as\nthey were not \"separately published\", which is the terminology used in the\nrestraint clauses. Perhaps it\nwould be more accurate to say that they were not\n\"separately distributed\". Physically each insert was, of course, not separated\nor\ndetached from the rest of the paper as it would have been if a copy had\nseparately been handed over to a buyer at the same time as\nThe Star itself. In\nmy opinion it is nevertheless arguable that, contextually at any rate, each\nFocus was a separate publication.\nIt is in tabloid form whereas The Star is a\nbroadsheet; it is separately paginated; it has its own approach, news items and\nadvertising;\nand it is capable of being distributed as a separate entity, as\nindeed happened before the respondents undertook to discontinue such\ndistribution. But it is not, for present purposes, necessary to pursue this\ntopic in view of the conclusion which I have reached\non the next issue viz.\nwhether these publications, distributed as part of The Star, were \"free\".\n24\nWhether the Focus inserts were \"free\"\nIn both the 1980 and the 1985\nagreements \"free\" is defined as \"a newspaper for which the recipient does not\npay\". It is the intention\nof the recipient which is important. When a recipient\npurchases The Star, in which the publication in question is enfolded, he pays\nfor a single article consisting of different parts. Even if the Focus may\nconceptually be regarded as a separate paper it is still\npart of the merx and\nthus part of the bargain. The recipient in effect gets two papers for the price\nof one - as he will in the rare\ninstance where he is anxious to acquire a Focus\nrather than a Star. In either case he pays for both. Neither is free (cf\nMinister\nof Mineral and Energy Affairs v Lucky Horseshoe (Pty) Ltd\n1994 (2) SA\n46\n(A) 53A-J).\nThe onus on this leg of the restraints is on the appellants to\nprove that the respondents contravened the restraint clauses. To succeed\nthe\nappellants had to show that the Focus inserts complied with all three of the\nrequirements mentioned i.e. that the inserts were\nseparate and free and\nnewspapers. Failure to prove any one of these requirements would be fatal.\n25\nThe appellants proved that the inserts were newspapers; I am prepared to\nassume that they were separate; but by no stretch of the\nimagination can they be\nsaid to be free.\nBut that is not the end of the matter. There is still the\nother leg of the restraints. Even if the appellants should fail to prove\nthat\nthe Focus inserts were free newspapers, the restraints would apply if the\nappellants could show that the inserts were \"local\"\nnewspapers. Then it would\nnot matter whether the disputed publications were distributed free of charge.\nWhether the Focus inserts qualified as \"local\" newspapers\nThe\nrestraint clauses in the two agreements draw a distinction between different\ncategories of publications - some the respondents\nare permitted to publish and\ndistribute, others not. Those categories are:\n(i) national newspapers, the distribution of which is not prohibited;\n(ii) regional newspapers, likewise permitted;\n(iii) separate free newspapers, the distribution of which is prohibited\nthroughout South Africa and Namibia; a contrario the distribution\nof\n26\nsuch a publication is not prohibited if the newspaper concerned is neither\nseparate nor free, unless its distribution is prohibited\nunder any of the\ncategories to follow;\n(iv) local newspapers under the 1980 restraint: their distribution was\nprohibited within the designated areas only. Outside those\nareas a local\nnewspaper could still be distributed but not if it took place free of charge. In\nthat event such publication could\nrun counter to (iii) above;\n(v) local newspapers under the 1985 restraint: the prohibition was now extended\ncountrywide. Under that category it no longer matters\nwhether the distribution\nis free. The only question is whether a newspaper which is not regional is\nlocal. If it is, it offends against\nthe 1985\nrestraint.\nCategories (iii) and (iv) might have overlapped but\nthey were not coextensive. In (iii) the emphasis was on the conditions of\ndistribution\n(\"separate, free\"), in (iv) on the area of distribution of the\npublication in\n27\nconjunction with its focus of attention (a particular locality). A\nnon-regional newspaper could therefore escape both restraints -\nunder (iii)\nbecause it was, for example, not free; under (iv) because it was published and\ndistributed outside the designated area.\nBut once the restraint was broadened in\n1985 to cover the whole country the distinction between the two types of\nrestraint became\nlargely irrelevant. Thereafter the restraint of (iii) could\nonly function if the paper complained of was free and separate and neither\nregional (permitted under (ii)) nor local (prohibited under (v)). But if \"local\"\nends where \"regional\" begins (an issue to which\nI shall return in a moment),\ncategory (iii) no longer has its own sphere of operation. Its function would\nthen have been usurped\nby (v).\nThe Court a quo held that the restraint\nclauses referred to in (iv) and (v) could not be enforced since it is impossible\nto determine,\nas a matter of interpretation, where the exact line lies between a\nregion (and hence a regional newspaper, which is not prohibited)\nand a locality\n(and hence a local paper, which is). The learned judge proceeded to say,\n28\n\"The papers before me attempt at some length to show how the parties themselves\nunderstood and applied the terms I have just interpreted.\nI do not intend\nreferring to the evidence in this regard in detail since the factors contained\nin such evidence and favouring my\ninterpretation are at least as strong, and\nprobably stronger, than those against it.\"\nThe reasoning, if I\nunderstand it correctly, is that the Court a quo considered the criteria in the\nclauses to be incapable of application;\nconsequently, that this aspect of the\nrestraint clauses was void for vagueness.\nWith respect I disagree. Viewed in\nvacuo the precise line between the concepts \"regional\" and \"local\" is doubtless\ndifficult to define.\nBut does that make the restraint clauses void for\nvagueness? Three points need to be made. One, the words in a contract must not\nbe interpreted in the abstract and out of context (cf Swart en 'n Ander v Cape\nFabrix (Pty) Ltd\n1979 (1) SA 195(A)\n, 202C). Two, a restraint which in general\nterms may be unduly wide or imprecise can be trimmed to fit the common\nunderstanding and\nperceptions of the parties in the light of the circumstances\nprevailing at the time of its enforcement (cf Magna Alloys and Research\n(SA)\n(Pty) Ltd v Ellis\n[1984] ZASCA 116\n;\n1984 (4) SA 874\n(A), 896A-E, 898D). Three, a conclusion of\n29\ninvalidity will only be reached as a last resort (cf Haviland Estates (Pty)\nLtd and Another v McMaster\n1969 (2) SA 312\n(A) 337H; Lewis v Oneanate (Pty)Ltd\nand Another 1992(4) SA 811 (A), 819E-J).\nThe parties to the respective\nagreements were men knowledgeable and experienced in the business of printing\nand publishing newspapers;\nthey were in the process of re-arranging and\nre-aligning their existing businesses; and there were in existence at the time\npublications\nconforming to the descriptions \"national\", \"regional\" and \"local\"\nused in the agreements. Those publications fell easily into the\nvarious\ncategories mentioned in the restraint clauses. In my view there can be little\ndoubt that when drafting the agreements concerned\nthe parties had in mind, when\nreferring to national newspapers, newspapers such as the Sunday Times; when\nreferring to regional newspapers,\nnewspapers such as The Star, the Cape Argus\nand the Natal Daily News; and when referring to local newspapers, newspapers\nsuch as\nthose published by Caxton. In that sense local newspapers would be\nnewspapers that were not national or regional. Of course, one\ncan conceive\n30\nof circumstances where these guidelines as to what the parties had in\nmind\nmight give rise to insuperable difficulties of application. But this, in\nmy\nopinion, is not such a case. In Hira and Another v Booysen and Another\n1992 (4) SA 69\n(A) 77B-H Nicholas AJA said:\n\"The territory which lies between in public on the left side and in private on\nthe right is largely uncharted, and it is difficult\nto define the position of\nthe boundary between them. Clearly a mass public meeting (or publication in a\nlarge-circulation newspaper)\nis located on the left and a conversation between\ntwo people (or a private written communication) is located on the right. At what\nstage does in public become in private? The problem is of a recurrent and\nfamiliar kind. (See the discussion on 'drawing the line'\nby R E Megarry in\nMiscellany at Law at 121.) In Boyse v Rossborough\n[1856-57] 6 HLC 3\nat 46\n(10 ER\n1192\nat 1210) the Lord Chancellor had to consider whether the alleged testator\nwas a person of sound mind at the time of the execution\nof a will. He\nsaid:\n'...[T]he difficulty to be grappled with arises from the\ncircumstances that the question is almost always one of degree. There is\nno\ndifficulty in the case of a raving madman or of a drivelling idiot, in saying\nthat he is not a person capable of disposing of\nproperty. But between such an\nextreme case and that of a man of perfectly sound and vigorous understanding,\nthere is every shade\nof intellect, every degree of mental capacity. There is no\npossibility of mistaking midnight for\n31\nnoon; but at what precise moment twilight becomes darkness is hard to\ndetermine.'\nIn Hobbs v London and South Western Rail Co\n(1875) LR 10 QB\n111\n, Blackburn J said at 121:\n'It is a vague rule, and ... it is something like having to draw a line between\nnight and day; there is a great duration of twilight\nwhen it is neither night\nnor day; but on the question now before the court, though you cannot draw the\nprecise line, you can say\non which side of the line the case\nis.'\nLord Coleridge CJ expressed himself similarly in The Southport\nCorporation v Morriss\n[1893] 1 QB 359\nat\n361:\n'The Attorney-General has asked where we are to draw the line. The answer is\nthat it is not necessary to draw it at any precise point.\nIt is enough for us to\nsay that the present case is on the right side of any reasonable line that could\nbe drawn.'\"\nHere too the Focus newspapers, inserted\ninto The Star and comparable to the Caxton publications in appearance and\ncontent, were clearly\nlocal and not regional, although distributed in selected\nlocalities together with and as part of a regional paper. It mattered not\nthat a\npublication like the Western Focus was distributed in 38 areas in which only\nfive of the first appellant's publications circulated.\nThe mere fact that a\npublication of the respondents covered a considerably wider area than one of the\nfirst appellant does not\n32\nmake the respondents' publication a regional rather than a local one. What\ndoes matter is that the Western Focus and other like newspapers\nwere distributed\nby the respondents in substantially smaller geographical areas than The Star,\nwhich by common consent is a regional\npublication. It is in that sense that the\nWestern Focus and its sister Focus publications can properly be described as\n\"local newspapers\"\nfor purposes of the restraint clauses. As such their\npublication and distribution offended against the second leg of the restraints\nreferred to above.\nIn my view the Court a quo was accordingly wrong in refusing the appellants\nany form of relief.\nThe form of the relief\nThe order sought in the notice of motion is not limited in time or in\ncircumstance. For the reasons mentioned above, more particularly\nunder the topic\n\"The duration of the restraint\", the appellants are not entitled to an interdict\nin the form of a declarator operating\nin perpetuity. Things change. The\ninterests of the appellants which the restraints seek to protect might no\n33\nlonger be worthy of protection in future; or the circumstances of the\nrespondents might so alter as to necessitate a review of the\nterms of the order.\nIt would therefore be prudent to build a qualification into the proposed order\npermitting the respondents to\napproach the Court below for an amendment of its\nterms should the equilibrium in the respective interests of the competing\nparties\nundergo a significant change.\nThe appeal is accordingly allowed with costs including the costs of two\ncounsel. The order of the Court a quo is set aside. Substituted\nfor it is the\nfollowing order:\n1)\tThe respondents are interdicted and restrained from directly or indirectly\npublishing their newspapers known as the \"Southern\nStar/Focus\", the \"Sandton\nStar\", the \"Eastern Star/Focus\", the \"Northern Star/Focus\", the \"Western\nStar/Focus\" or any newspaper substantially\nsimilar in nature and\ncirculation.\n2)\tLeave is granted to the respondents, jointly or severally, to approach the\nCourt, on due notice to the other parties, and\non\n34\ngood cause being shown that circumstances have materially\nchanged, for an order rescinding or amending the above\norder.\n3) The respondents are ordered to pay the applicants' costs,\njointly\nand severally, the one paying the other to be absolved,\nsuch\ncosts to include the costs of\ntwo counsel.\nP M Nienaber Judge of Appeal Corbett CJ ) EM Grosskopf JA) Concur Smalberger\nJA ) Nicholas AJA )",

    "facts": "The parties had entered into a joint venture in the printing and publishing industry, formalised by agreements in 1980 and 1985. Both agreements contained reciprocal non‑competition restraints: the 1980 agreement restrained the Argus group from publishing separate free or local newspapers in certain districts, while the 1985 agreement extended those restraints country‑wide and added a prohibition on publishing any separate free newspaper. In 1991 the Argus group began publishing a series of regional supplements to The Star newspaper, known as the “Focus” inserts, which the appellants alleged were separate free or local newspapers in breach of the restraints.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the publishing restraints in the 1980 and 1985 agreements are enforceable against the respondents. 2. Whether the “Focus” inserts qualify as (a) newspapers, (b) separate publications, (c) free publications, or (d) local newspapers within the meaning of the restraints. 3. Whether the indefinite duration of the restraints contravenes public policy or is void for vagueness.",
    "principles": "The Court applied principles governing restraints of trade: a restraint must protect a legitimate proprietary interest, be reasonable in scope and duration, and not be against public policy. Indefinite restraints are not per se invalid if they are tied to a legitimate interest. Ambiguities in contractual language are to be interpreted in context, and a clause is not void for vagueness unless it cannot be given any meaning. The definition of “newspaper”, “separate”, “free” and “local” were examined against statutory definitions and industry usage.",
    "application": "The Court held that clause 2.2 of the 1985 agreement was merely a recordal and not a limiting term, so the restraints on the respondents were indefinite but enforceable. The “Focus” inserts were found to be newspapers and, despite being inserted in The Star, were separate publications in form and distribution. They were not free because readers paid for The Star, which included the inserts. However, the Court concluded that the inserts qualified as local newspapers because they were distributed only in limited geographic areas, distinct from the regional reach of The Star. Accordingly, the respondents breached the 1985 restraint.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed. The order of the lower court was set aside and a new order was made interdicting the respondents from publishing the “Focus” newspapers or any similar publications. The respondents were granted leave to apply to vary or rescind the order if circumstances materially changed, and they were ordered to pay the applicants’ costs, jointly and severally, including the costs of two counsel."
