In\naddition, the appellant, on his own, was\ncharged with two offences under the\nArms and Ammunition Act, No 75 of 1969 (\"the Act\"). He was acquitted on the\ncounts of murder\nand attempted murder, but convicted on both counts of\ncontravening the Act. These counts were, first, contravening s 2 by unlawfully\npossessing two 7.62 mm Heckler and Koch G3 rifles and second, contravening s 36\nby possessing 15 rounds of ammunition which were\nfound in the magazine of one of\nthe rifles. The rifles were handed in as Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 3 and it is\nconvenient to refer to\nthem as such. The counts were taken together for the\npurpose of sentence and the appellant was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment.\nThe\n3\nappeal, with the necessary leave, is against both the conviction and the\nsentence.\nAll but one of the counts on which the appellant was\nacquitted arose out of an attack on a minibus containing some ten people by a\ngroup of armed men who fired shots into the vehicle in circumstances which\nindicated an intention to kill the occupants. The incident,\nwhich appeared to\nhave been politically motivated, occurred on 4 July 1992 in the Bhomela ward\nnear Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal,\nand at a place not far from the home of the\nappellant who is the chief of what was described in evidence as the Nsimbini\ntribe. On\n7 July 1992 both rifles were found in the appellant's house. Ballistic\nevidence established that three spent cartridges found about\n20 metres in front\nof the minibus after the attack had been fired from Exhibit 3. This was also the\nrifle which contained the rounds\nforming the subject of the second count under\nthe Act.\n4\nIt was common cause that both rifles had been issued by the KwaZulu\nGovernment to Mr Gilbert Ndwalane, the brother of the appellant.\nAccording\nto the permits, they were to be used for\nthe purpose of protecting he property of the KwaZulu Government. As chairman of\nthe tribal\nauthority of which the appellant is the chief, Mr Gilbert Ndwalane\nwas authorised to possess weapons of this kind which had been\nissued to him and,\nin turn, issue them to deserving permit holders after they had received training\nat Ulundi. It appears that one\nof the rifles, Exhibit 1, had previously been\nissued to a Mr Momomo Ndwalane who was an induna in the area. After his death in\n1991\nthe weapon disappeared but was later recovered by the police. On 22 June\n1992 it was returned to Mr Gilbert Ndwalane who wished to\nre-allocate it to\nanother induna. But before he could do so certain documentary approval was\nrequired from Ulundi. The other rifle,\nExhibit 3, had been issued by Mr Gilbert\nNdwalane to his\n5\nbrother Ernest. The latter subsequently left the area to live in Durban\nand the rifle was returned to Mr Gilbert Ndwalane. This occurred\nlong before the\nattack on 4 July 1992. It was accordingly not in dispute that during the period\nreferred to in the indictment, viz\n4 to 7 July 1992, Mr Gilbert Ndwalane was\nlawfully entitled to be in possession of both rifles.\nThe evidence relating to the counts in question was largely confined to\nthat of two witnesses. The one was Warrant Officer Breedt,\nthe investigating\nofficer. The other was Mr Gilbert Ndwalane. The latter was originally to be a\nState witness, but was eventually\ncalled as a witness for the defence. The\nappellant, himself, did not give evidence.\nMr Breedt testified that on 7 July 1992 he received a radiotelephone call\nfrom members of The Special Branch Unit from Port Shepstone\nwho were at the\nappellant's house where they had found a person in possession of a handgun. He\nsaid he immediately went with his\n6\nconstable assistant to the appellant's house where he assumed control of\nthe situation. He explained that a few days previously he\nhad seen the appellant\nin a motor car in which there was a G3 rifle. He accordingly asked him if he was\nin possession of any G3 rifles.\nThe appellant, he said, thereupon went into his\nhouse and returned with Exhibit 3. According to Mr Breedt there were 15 rounds\nin\nthe magazine. He said he asked the appellant if there were any other firearms\nof the same calibre in the house and on being told\nthere were not, he proceeded\nto search the house. During the search he noticed that the appellant appeared to\nbe nervous and while\nin the main bedroom glanced up at the ceiling on a few\noccasions. Mr Breedt said he observed that there was a break in the ceiling.\nHe\nclimbed on a chair and discovered another rifle, Exhibit 1, in the ceiling. He\ntestified that the appellant told him that he knew\nnothing about this weapon. Mr\nGilbert Ndwalane disputed that it was Mr Breedt who had\n7\ndiscovered the two rifles at the appellant's house on 7 July 1992. He\nsaid that he was present when Mr Breedt arrived and by that\ntime the other\npoliceman had already taken possession of the firearms. He said he saw them\ncounting the rounds taken from the magazine\nand there were twenty and not\nfifteen rounds. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that both rifles were being kept at\nthe appellant's house.\nHe said that Exhibit 3 was kept in a wardrobe in the\nappellant's bedroom. He did not dispute that the appellant was aware of this\nand\nacknowledged in cross-examination that he had personally entrusted the appellant\nwith the safe-keeping of the weapon while he,\nGilbert, was away. So far as\nExhibit 1 was concerned, he said that after receiving it from Mr Breedt (on 22\nJune 1992) he brought\nit to the appellant's house. The latter was not there so\nhe handed it to the appellant's wife and asked her to put it away pending\nthe\narrival of documents from Ulundi at which stage he proposed issuing it to an\ninduna.\n8\nHe said Mrs Ndwalane then took the rifle into a bedroom and that he,\nGilbert, did not know what happened to it after that. The dispute\nas to the\nnumber of rounds of ammunition found in the magazine of Exhibit 3 may have been\nof some significance with regard to the\ncounts on which the appellant was\nacquitted but it is of little consequence in so far as the contravention of the\nAct is concerned.\nAs previously mentioned, Mr Gilbert Ndwalane was entitled to be in\npossession of both Exhibits 1 and 3. The explanation he gave for\nwhy they were\nkept at the appellant's house was not seriously challenged by the State and was\naccepted by the Court a quo. He said\nthat his kraal had been burned down and he\nhad turned to his brother, the appellant, to provide him with accommodation. He\nworked\nin Durban as a security guard. Each week he did two day shifts followed\nby two night shifts. He would then, he said, return to the\nappellant's house for\ntwo days a week.\n9\nAs chairman of the tribal authority he was essentially the appellant's\nassistant and while at his house the two of them would attend\nto the affairs of\nthe tribe together. The Nsimbini tribal court house had also been burnt down in\nthe violence which plagued the\narea. This occurred sometime in 1990. He said\nthat all tribal affairs had thereafter been conducted at the appellant's house.\nWith\nregard to the rifles, he explained that ordinarily he would have kept them\nlocked up in the court house, but after the fire it was\nconvenient to keep them\nat the appellant's house where other property which pertained to the tribe was\nalso kept.\nWith regard to the dispute concerning the circumstances in which the\nrifles were discovered, the Court a quo accepted the evidence\nof Mr Breedt in\npreference to that of Mr Gilbert Ndwalane. Squires J, in delivering the judgment\nof the Court, described Mr Ndwalane\nas an \"unimpressive\" witness who was\n\"unconvincing in content and plainly\n10\nuncomfortable in demeanour, and with powerful motives to exculpate his\nbrother, the accused.\" It appears from the record that Mr Ndwalane's\nevidence\nconcerning the discovery of the rifles was initially vague and ambivalent. It\nwas only in cross-examination and again while\nbeing reexamined that he\nunequivocally asserted that the firearms had been discovered and taken into the\npossession of the police\nprior to the arrival of Mr Breedt. This evidence was\nalso in conflict with his earlier confession that he saw the appellant hand\nExhibit 3 to Mr Breedt. In the circumstances, I can see no basis for interfering\nwith the finding of the Court a quo on this issue,\nnor did Counsel for the\nappellant attempt to advance any reason for doing so.\nThe issue, however, is not of much importance. As previously mentioned,\nit was common cause that both rifles were being kept at the\nappellant's house.\nAlthough Squires J did not specifically refer to the\n11\npresumption contained in s 40(1) of the Act it is implicit in the\njudgment\nthat reliance was placed upon it. The section reads:\n\"40(1) Whenever in any prosecution for being in possession of any article\ncontrary to the provisions of this Act, it is proved that\nsuch article has at\nany time been on or in any premises, including any building, dwelling, flat,\nroom, office, shop, structure, vessel,\naircraft or vehicle or any part thereof,\nany person who at that time was on or in or in charge of or present at or\noccupying such\npremises, shall be presumed to have been in possession of that\narticle at that time, until the contrary is\nproved.\"\nThe presumption is far reaching\nand places upon an accused\nperson proved to fall within its ambit the burden of proving on a\nbalance\nof probabilities that he was not in possession of the article in\nquestion.\n(See S v Makunga and Others 1977(1) SA 685 (A) at 698 H - 699\nB.)\nMr Padayachee, who appeared for the appellant both in this Court and in\nthe Court below, categorised the presumption as being \"unjustifiable\nand\nirrational\" and initially sought to attack it on the ground that it was\nunconstitutional. The appellant however was convicted\nand\n12\nsentenced prior to 27 April 1994, being the date upon which the\nConstitution (Act 200 of 1993) came into operation, and it has since\nbeen held\nby the Constitutional Court that in such circumstances an appeal is to be\ndisposed of without reference to Chapter 3 of\nthe Constitution. (See S v Mhlungu\nand Others\n[1995] ZACC 4\n;\n1995 (7) BCLR 793\n(CC) at 813 - 814 (para 41).)\nMr Padayachee submitted that the appellant had, in any event, discharged\nthe burden imposed upon him by the presumption in as much\nas the evidence\nestablished that the firearms and ammunition were at all times in the lawful\npossession of Mr Gilbert Ndwalane who,\nwhen not away at work, lived at the\nappellant's house. Counsel argued that in coming to the conclusion that the\nappellant had been\nin possession of the firearms, the Court a quo had in the\ncircumstances placed too wide a construction on the word \"possession\" in\ns 2 and\ns 36 of the Act.\nSection 1(1) of the Act provides that unless the\ncontext\n13\notherwise indicates:\n\"'possession' includes 'custody' and 'possess' shall be construed\naccordingly\"\nThe significance of the definition becomes\napparent when regard is had to\nthe common law. A distinction is drawn between civil possession\n(possessio civilis) and natural possession (possessio naturalis).\nBoth\ncomprise two elements; a physical element (corpus) and a mental\nelement\n(animus). In the case of civil possession the animus consists of\nthe\nintention on the part of the possessor to hold the article or object\nin\nquestion for himself as if he were the owner (animus possidendi),\nwhile\nin the case of natural possession the animus need merely consist of\nthe\nintention of the possessor to control the article for his own purpose\nor\nbenefit, and not as owner (see S v Adams 1986(4) SA 882 (A) at 890 H\n-\nI). In both cases, the physical element, that is to say, the physical\ncontrol\nor custody (detentio) over the article may be exercised by the\npossessor\n14\nhimself or by someone else on his behalf. (See R v Binns and Another\n1961\n(2) SA 104\n(T) at 107 D and 108 A - D.) Not surprisingly the term \"possession\"\nwhen used in penal statutes has in the past frequently given\nrise to\ndifficulties, mainly because in common parlance the term is frequently used in\nrelation to a person who merely exercises\ncustody or control over an article on\nbehalf of another. In each case it has been necessary to decide whether in the\ncontext in which\nit is used in the statute, the term is to be given this\nextended meaning or whether it is to be confined to its meaning at common\nlaw.\nWhere, as in the present case, the word \"possession\" is defined so as to include\n\"custody\", the ambiguity is, however, largely\nremoved (cf S v Brick\n1973 (2) SA\n571\n(A) at 579 H). That the word \"possession\" in the Act is intended to be given\nits wider meaning so as to include one who merely exercises\nphysical control on\nbehalf of another becomes even clearer if regard is had to the provisions\nof\n15\ns 8(l)(b), which, prior to its amendment in 1993, read as\nfollows:\n\"8 (1) Any person not being under the age of 16 years or not being a\ndisqualified person may, with the prior consent of the holder\nof a licence to\npossess an arm and for such period as such holder may permit, have such arm in\nhis possession, without holding any\nlicence, provided\n-\n(a)\n(b) such person has the arm in his possession -\n(i) in the immediate vicinity of the licence holder\nor\nwhile on any land belonging to or lawfully\noccupied by the licence holder;\"\nThe need of the Legislature to expressly authorise the possession\nreferred to in the proviso is the clearest indication of the wide\nmeaning to be\ngiven to the term \"possession\" as used in the Act. Indeed, if the word were to\nbe construed in the manner suggested\nby Mr Padayachee the proviso would have\nbeen unnecessary. (See in relation to the previous Act, No 28 of 1937, S v Essop\n1967 (4) SA 625\n(T) at 626 D - 627 D.)\nIt follows that in order to escape conviction the appellant\nwas\n16\nobliged to establish on a balance of probabilities that he was not in\n\"possession\" of the firearms in the sense discussed above. This\nhe clearly\nfailed to do. On the contrary, it was common cause that Exhibit 3 had been\nentrusted to him. As regards Exhibit 1, the\nprobabilities are that he was aware\nof its presence in the ceiling rather than that he was not. The appeal against\nthe conviction\non both counts must therefore fail.\nTurning to the appeal against sentence, Squires J, in imposing a period\nof imprisonment of 8 years, emphasised the appellant's previous\nconvictions and\nthe penalty provided for in the Act. Both factors are undoubtedly of importance.\nIt appears that in 1987 the appellant\nwas declared to be unfit to possess a\nfirearm for a period of 10 years following his conviction on two counts of\nattempted murder\ninvolving the use of a revolver. In 1990 he was convicted of\npossessing an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and was sentenced to\ntwo years\neffective imprisonment.\n17\nIn terms of s 39(2)(a) of the Act and by reason of the appellant's\npossession in the present case of more than one firearm, the sentence\nprescribed\nwas imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years. A further aggravating\nFeature was undoubtedly the extent of the\nviolence involving the use of firearms\nwhich plagues the area in which the offences were committed, although it does\nappear that\nthe appellant had played a role in attempting to restore peace to\nthe area.\nNonetheless, the sentence of 8 years imprisonment strikes\nme as unduly harsh having regard to the particular circumstances in which\nthe\noffences were committed. It was common cause that the appellant's brother, Mr\nGilbert Ndwalane, was lawfully entitled to be in\npossession of both weapons and\nthat it was his intention in due course to allocate them to some suitable\nperson. It was also not\nin dispute that both Mr Gilbert Ndwalane's own kraal and\nthe tribal court house had been burnt down in\n18\nthe ongoing violence. Ordinarily he would have kept the weapons under\nlock and key at the court house, but this was not possible.\nThere is nothing to\nsuggest that the appellant possessed the weapons and ammunition for his own\nbenefit. On the contrary, the evidence\nsuggests that he was no more than a\ncustodian. In my view the failure on the part of Squires J to give any or\nadequate weight to\nthese circumstances amounted to a misdirection entitling this\nCourt to impose sentence afresh.\nMr Padayachee suggested a wholly suspended sentence of imprisonment. I\ncannot agree. The appellant has a previous conviction for the\nsame type of\noffence and for which he was sent to prison for two years. In my view a sentence\nof three years imprisonment would be\nappropriate in all the\ncircumstances.\nIn the result the appeal against the conviction on both counts fails. The\nappeal against sentence succeeds and the sentence of 8 years\n19\nimprisonment is set aside and replaced with a sentence of 3 years\nimprisonment, both counts being taken together for the purpose of\nsentence.\nD G SCOTT\nHEFER JA)\n- Concur NESTADT JA)",

    "facts": "The appellant, Makhanda Aaron Ndwalane, was charged with seven counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder and two charges under the Arms and Ammunition Act for unlawful possession of two 7.62 mm G3 rifles and 15 rounds of ammunition. He was acquitted of the murder charges but convicted on the two firearms offences. The rifles had been issued by the KwaZulu government to the appellant's brother, Gilbert Ndwalane, who was lawfully entitled to possess them and was keeping them at the appellant's house after his own kraal and tribal court house were burnt down. On 7 July 1992 police entered the appellant's house, seized the rifles (Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 3) and the ammunition. The issue centred on whether the appellant was in possession of the firearms for the purposes of the Act.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the statutory presumption of possession under s 40(1) of the Arms and Ammunition Act applied to the appellant. 2) Whether the appellant could discharge the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he was not in possession of the rifles and ammunition. 3) Whether the presumption was constitutionally valid. 4) What sentence was appropriate for the conviction under s 2 and s 36 of the Act.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the presumption in s 40(1) which places the burden on a person present at premises where a prohibited article is found to prove lack of possession. \"Possession\" under the Act includes custody, as defined in s 1(1) and interpreted in cases such as S v Makunga and S v Adams, distinguishing civil and natural possession but extending to physical control on behalf of another. The burden shifts to the accused to rebut the presumption on the balance of probabilities. Sentencing principles under s 39(2)(a) allow up to ten years for possession of more than one firearm, with aggravating factors including prior convictions and the violent context.",
    "application": "The Court found that the presumption applied because the rifles were on premises where the appellant was present. The appellant failed to rebalance the presumption; the evidence showed the rifles had been entrusted to him and he was aware of their presence. Accordingly, the conviction on both counts was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court considered the appellant's prior convictions, the statutory maximum, and mitigating factors such as his custodial role and the destruction of the tribal court house. It concluded that the original eight‑year term was unduly harsh and substituted a three‑year imprisonment.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal against conviction was dismissed; the convictions under s 2 and s 36 of the Arms and Ammunition Act stand. The appeal against sentence succeeded; the eight‑year sentence was set aside and a revised sentence of three years imprisonment was imposed."
