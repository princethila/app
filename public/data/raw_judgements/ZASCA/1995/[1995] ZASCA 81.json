The income generating\nactivities of REIT and Tisand are so closely intertwined that\nthe hearings of\nboth appeals were consolidated before the court\na quo\n, as were the\nappeals to this court. Both appellants were represented by the same counsel and\nattorneys in the court a quo. On appeal\nto this court they were represented\nagain by the same\n3\ncounsel and attorneys.\nThe questions which fall to be considered will be\nbetter understood if their formulation is deferred until after the factual\nbackground\ngiving rise to them has been sketched. The coastal dunes in the\nvicinity of Richards Bay in Zululand are rich in certain minerals.\nREIT and\nTisand join forces to extract and beneficiate those which are valuable. The\nprocess, in broad, consists of creating in the\ndunes self-contained ponds of\nwater into which dune sand is made to slump by undermining the face of the\ndunes; of removing the resultant\nslurry by suction with the aid of a floating\ndredger; of separating the heavy mineral concentrate from the dune sand in a\nfloating\nconcentrator plant by means of a gravity separation process; of\nseparating that heavy mineral concentrate in a mineral separation\nplant into\nrutile, zircon, monazite and ilmenite; and of thereafter\n4\nbeneficiating the ilmenite in a sophisticated smelter complex to yield\ntitania slag and an iron of high purity.\nRutile and zircon are sold as mineral sands. Rutile is used as a raw material\nin the manufacture of pigment and in the production\nof titanium metal, as well\nas a flux coating on welding electrodes. Zircon is used mostly as an opacifier\nin ceramic glazes, a constituent\nof refractory materials used in the production\nof steel and glass, and as a moulding sand in foundries. It is also used in the\nproduction\nof zirconium oxide, metal and chemicals, sanitary ware and tiles.\nThe titania slag is cooled, crushed and screened into different grades,\nstored in silos, and sold to customers both here and abroad.\nIt is an essential\nraw material for the production of titanium dioxide pigment which is a white\npigment used in the production of\n5\npaints, plastics, paper and printing inks. It is also used in the production\nof textile fibres and vitreous enamels.\nThe high purity iron is essentially a\nraw material used by the ductile iron foundry industry. The iron's low manganese\nand phosphorus\ncontent provides important metallurgical and economic advantages\nfor the industry. The iron is marketed in the form of \"pigs\" or\ningots.\nThe role of each of the appellants in this process requires explanation.\nTisand is owned by a majority of South African shareholders\nand holds the\nmineral rights which are being exploited. REIT is owned by a majority of\nCanadian shareholders. The two companies operate\nin conjunction with one another\nunder the style Richards Bay Minerals. Tisand conducts the operations which\nresult in the production\nof the heavy mineral concentrate. It separates them\n6\ninto three main products, namely, ilmenite, rutile and zircon. Some monazite\nis also produced. It sells the ilmenite to RBIT and the\nrutile and zircon to\nwhomsoever will buy them (mainly, purchasers abroad). The monazite was at one\ntime readily saleable but has\nbecome less so as a consequence of the discovery\nof a better product in China. Tisand sells it when it can. RBIT processes and\nsmelts\nthe ilmenite purchased from Tisand to produce titania slag and high\npurity iron, mainly for export.\nIn the course of these operations, there are\nbrought into existence at various stages what are described by appellants as\n\"stockpiles\"\nof material. It is the status in tax law of some of those\nstockpiles, and the extent, if any, to which they are to be taken into\naccount\nin assessing appellants' taxable income, which require to be considered in this\nappeal. That necessitates a more detailed\n7\ndescription of some aspects of appellants' operations, and the nature of the\nrelevant stockpiles.\nFrom every 1000 tons of dune sand, Tisand produces some\n50-70 tons of heavy mineral concentrate of which about 70 per cent are valuable\nheavy minerals. The heavy mineral concentrate is pumped to a specially prepared\nstockpile area and it is that concentrate which is\nreferred to as stockpile 1.\nHeavy mineral concentrate taken from there may go directly into the mineral\nseparation plant or may go\ninto another stockpile of heavy mineral concentrate\nmaintained at the plant. That stockpile is known as stockpile 2, or the \"Sunday\"\nstockpile and it serves as a \"stand-by\" supply of heavy mineral concentrate to\nensure that at all times there will be a supply of\nconcentrate available to keep\nthe plant operating continuously. Temporary shut downs are expensive and\nrestarting complicated.\n8\nWhat is in stockpiles 1 and 2 is mainly a mixture of ilmenite, rutile,\nzircon, and monazite.\nTisand subjects the heavy mineral concentrate to\ntreatment in a minerals separation plant. What emerges is, on the one hand,\nilmenite\nwhich goes into stockpile 3, and is referred to as roaster feed and, on\nthe other, a mixture of rutile and zircon which goes into\nstockpile 4. There is\nalso a residual mixture of ilmenite, monazite, rutile and zircon (described as\nLSR (low susceptible rejects)\nconcentrates in the documentation and the record)\nwhich constitutes stockpile 5. The material in stockpile 5 is subjected by\nTisand\nto a process designed to extract from it, and to separate, any remaining\nilmenite. Any ilmenite so recovered is added to stockpile\n3. It is the ilmenite\nin stockpile 3 which is sold by Tisand to REIT. The monazite is also separated\nfrom the material in stockpile\n5 during this\n9\nprocess, as are the rutile and zircon. The monazite is stored in a silo and\nreferred to as stockpile 9. The rutile and zircon recovered\nwill have not yet\nhave been separated from one another and they will be processed together with\nthe rutile and zircon mixture emanating\nfrom stockpile 4. The two minerals are\nseparated from each other by electrostatic techniques. The rutile goes into a\nsilo described\nas stockpile 6. The zircon is subjected to further treatment\nwhich yields two grades of zircon. The standard grade goes to stockpile\n7; the\nprime grade goes to stockpile 8. That describes Tisand's operations sufficiently\nfor present purposes, and accounts for stockpiles\n1 to 9. I turn now to the\noperations of REIT.\nREIT subjects the ilmenite in stockpile 3 to a roasting and magnetic process\nwhich removes calcium and chrome from it and renders\nit suitable for smelting.\nIt emerges as pure ilmenite and it is\n10\nstored in silos described as stockpile 10. At this stage it is referred to as\nsmelter feed and is a composite of titanium and iron\noxide. The smelting process\nrequires anthracite to be used as a reductant. It is heated in a charring plant\nto reduce its volatile\ncontent and to create char and coke stockpiles. The char\nis conveyed to the smelter where it is blended with the smelter feed (roasted\nilmenite) from stockpile 10 and the resultant blend is referred to as furnace\ncharge and constitutes stockpile 10a.\nIn the furnace the carbon in the char combines with the oxygen in the iron\noxide and molten iron is produced. The iron oxide having\nbeen removed from the\nilmenite, a high grade titania slag (titanium dioxide) is produced. The titania\nslag is tapped into moulds,\ncooled, crushed, and sized. The various grades and\ntypes of slag are in stockpiles 11, 12,12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, and 12c. They are\nmarketable\n11\nas such.\nThe molten iron is subjected to further treatment at an iron\ninjection plant where chemical additives are injected to obtain grades\nrequired\nby REIT's customers. The molten iron is then cast into \"pigs\" or ingots and\ncomprises stockpile 13.\nIn completing their income tax returns for the\nrelevant tax years, and more specifically, when calculating their trading\nincome, appellants\nfailed to take into account the value of certain of the\nstockpiles. Appellants subtracted from their trading income all the deductible\nexpenses incurred in producing these stockpiles, but failed to add to such\nincome the value to appellants of the stockpiles generated\nby a good deal of\nthat expenditure. The economic and financial benefit which had accrued to\nappellants as a result of such expenditure\nwas simply ignored.\n12\nThe questions which arise in this appeal are the consequence of the\nCommissioner adding to the profits of appellants for the tax years\nin issue\nsubstantial amounts running into millions of rands and representing what the\nCommissioner styled \"closing stock in respect\nof work in progress\" for the 1987\ntax year, and \"increase in work in progress stock\" in the tax years 1988, 1989,\nand 1990. In the\ncase of REIT, and for the 1989 tax year, the Commissioner\ndeducted from its taxable income an amount representing what he styled\n\"decrease\nin work in progress stock\". In effecting these adjustments the Commissioner\nsought to rectify the failure of appellants\nto reflect the value of the\nparticular stockpiles when calculating their taxable income. Appellants contend\nthat they acted correctly\nin ignoring the relevant stockpiles. The Commissioner\ncontends that they did not.\nThe Commissioner's contention is founded upon the\n13\nprovisions of sec. 22 read with the definition of \"trading stock\" in sec.\n1, of the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 (\"the Act\") and the\nparticular\ncharacter of the stockpiles in issue. Those provisions of sec.\n22 of the Act\nwhich are directly relevant to the questions (I omit those\nwhich are not)\nthen read:\n\"(1) The amount which shall, in the determination of the taxable income\nderived by any person during any year of assessment from carrying\non any trade\n(other than farming), be taken into account in respect of the value of any\ntrading stock held and not disposed of by\nhim at the end of such year of\nassessment, shall be the cost price to such person of such trading stock, less\nsuch amount as the\nCommissioner may think just and reasonable as representing\nthe amount by which the value of such trading stock, not being shares\nheld by\nany company in any other company, has been diminished by reason of damage,\ndeterioration, change in fashion, decrease in\nthe market value or for any other\nreason satisfactory to the Commissioner.\n(2) The amount which shall in the determination of the taxable income derived\nby any person during the year of\n14\nassessment from carrying on any trade (other than farming), be taken into\naccount in respect of the value of any trading stock held\nand not disposed of by\nhim at the beginning of any year of assessment, shall -\n(a)\nif such trading stock\nformed part of the trading stock of such person at the end of the immediately\npreceding year of assessment be\nthe amount which was, in the determination of\nthe taxable income of such person for such preceding year of assessment, taken\ninto\naccount in respect of the value of such trading stock at the end of such\npreceding year of assessment; or\n(b)\nif such\ntrading stock did not form part of the trading stock of such person at the end\nof the immediately preceding year of assessment,\nbe the cost price to such\nperson of such trading stock.\n(3) (a) For the\npurposes of this section the cost price at any date of any trading stock in\nrelation to any person shall be the cost\nincurred by such person, whether in the\ncurrent or any previous year of assessment in acquiring such trading stock,\nplus, subject\nto the provisions of paragraph (b), any further costs incurred by\nhim up to and including the said date in getting such trading stock\ninto its\nthen existing condition and location.\n(b) The further costs which in terms of paragraph (a) are required to be\nincluded in the cost price\n15\nof any trading stock shall be such costs as in terms of any generally accepted\naccounting practice approved by the Commissioner should\nbe included in the\nvaluation of such trading stock.\"\n\"(4) If any trading stock has been acquired by any person for no consideration\nor for a consideration which is not measurable in\nterms of money, such person\nshall for the purposes of sub-section (3) be deemed to have acquired such\ntrading stock at a cost equal\nto the price which in the opinion of the\nCommissioner was the current market price of such trading stock on the date on\nwhich it\nwas acquired by such person: Provided that any capitalization shares\nawarded by any company to shareholders of that company on or\nafter 1 July 1957\nshall have no value as trading stock in the hands of such shareholders: Provided\nfurther that options or any other\nrights to acquire shares in any company which\nhave been acquired as aforesaid shall have no\nvalue.\"\nLegislative alterations of sec 22 have been\nmade since, but without retroactive effect, and the changes made have no bearing\nupon\nthe questions raised in this appeal.\nThe definition of \"trading stock\" in sec. 1 of the Act\nread\n16\nat the relevant times:\n\" 'Trading stock' includes anything produced, manufactured,\npurchased or in\nany other manner acquired by a taxpayer for\npurposes of manufacture, sale or\nexchange by him or on his\nbehalf, or the proceeds from the disposal of which\nforms or will\nform part of his gross income\".\nSubsequent\namendments brought about by sec 2 (1) (e) of Act No 101 of 1990 and sec 2 (1)\n(m) of Act No 113 of 1993 were not operative\nduring the tax years in issue and\nare consequently not material for present purposes.\nThe rationale for the existence of these provisions is neither far to seek\nnor difficult to comprehend. The South African system of\ntaxation of income\nentails determining what the taxpayer's gross income was, subtracting from it\nany income which is exempt from\ntax, subtracting from the resultant income any\ndeductions allowed by the Act, and thereby arriving at the taxable income. It is\non\nthe\n17\nlatter income that tax is levied. The concepts involved are defined in the\nAct.\nCommissioner for Inland Revenue v Nemojim (Pty) Ltd\n1983(4) SA\n935(A) at 946G-H. Where a taxpayer is carrying on a trade, any expenditure\nincurred by him in the acquisition of trading\nstock is deductible in terms of\nsec. 11(a) of the Act because it is expenditure incurred in the production of\nincome, and it is not\nof a capital nature. Income generated by the sale of such\nstock is of course part of the trader's gross income. Where in his first\nyear of\ntrading a trader has bought, and thereafter sold, all the stock which he\nacquired during that year, no problem arises. There\nwill be a perfect\ncorrelation between the trading income earned and the expenditure incurred in\nthat particular year in purchasing\nand selling the stocks sold, and the\ndifference between the two sums will give a true picture of the result of the\nyear's trading.\nThere will be no stock on hand at the close of\n18\nthe year of which account need be taken. Contrast with that situation, a\nsituation in which the trader, having sold all the stock\nacquired earlier during\nthat year at a substantial profit, purchases large quantities of stock just\nprior to the close of his tax\nand trading year. | If he were permitted to deduct\nthe cost of purchasing that stock from the income generated by his sales,\nwithout\nacknowledging the benefit of the stock acquired, he would be escaping\ntaxation in that year on income which otherwise would have\nbeen taxable, by the\nsimple expedient of converting it into trading stock of the same value. That\nprocess could be repeated every\nyear\nad infinitum\n. It is true that there\nwould ultimately have to be a day of reckoning when trading finally ceases, but\nthe fact remains that the\ntaxpayer will have been enabled to avoid liability for\ntax until that point is reached. Where the trader is an individual who is\nsubject to rising marginal tax rates\n19\nas his trading profit increases, he would be enabled to so regulate his\napparent profit that he immunised himself from them indefinitely.\nAll this\nappears to be recognised expressly or implicitly by the writers of text-books on\nincome tax in South Africa. See\nMeyerowitz and Spiro on Income Tax\n, para.\n538;\nSilke on South African Income Tax,\npara. 8.111; Williams,\nIncome\nTax in South Africa\n.\nLaw and Practice\n. (1994) at page 281; Stack and\nCronje,\nThe Taxation of Individuals and Companies\n. 8th ed. (1994), pages\n163 and 342. In Australia, whose system of taxation has much in common with our\nown in its eschewal of the\nassessment of tax on the profits or gains of a\nbusiness in accordance with undiluted accounting principles and practices, and\nits\npreference for the assessment of tax upon the excess of assessable income\nover allowable deductions, the rationale for the existence\nof provisions broadly\nsimilar to sec 22 of the South\n20\nAfrican Act has been explained by the High Court in\nFederal Commissioner\nof Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd (in liquidation\n) (1978) 78\nAustralasian Tax Reports 452. The decision is helpful in two respects. Firstly,\nit explains why it is necessary to take\ninto account the value of trading stock\non hand at the beginning and at the close of a tax year. Secondly, it explains\nwhy trading\nstock is now regarded as encompassing more than the stock of goods\nacquired or ! manufactured by a trader to be sold. Because the\nreport of the\ncase is unlikely to be generally accessible in South Africa I shall quote\nextensively from it.\nStephen J\n(at 456) recalled that in\nC of T (SA)v Executor Trustee\n& Agency Co of SA Ltd (Garden's case\n)\n[1938] HCA 69\n;\n(1938) 63 CLR 108\nat 156,\n1 AITR\n416\nat 443,\nDixon J\nhad said: \"The basis of a trading account is stock on\nhand at the beginning and end of the period and\n21\nsales and purchases\". He went on to say that\nDixon J\nhad explained why\nit is impracticable to estimate income from trade otherwise than by means of a\nprofit and loss account, and had\nadded that the computation of profits from\ntrading \"has always been upon the principle that the profit may be contained in\nstock-in-trade\n—\".\nStephen J\nconcluded that only \"by taking account\nof stock-in-trade in the conventional way can a correct reflex of the trader's\nincome for\nthe accounting period be obtained\", and that the provisions in\nsections 28-31 of the Australian legislation were there to ensure\n\"such a\ncorrect reflex in the case of stock-in-trade\". Reference was also made to a\npassage from the speech of\nLord Reid\nin\nDuple Motor Bodies Ltd\nv\nOstime\n[1961] UKHL 6\n;\n(1961) 39 TC 537\nat 569-70 in which he said \"\tlong ago\nit became customary to take account of stock-in-trade, and for a simple\nreason. If the amount of stock-in-trade has increased materially\nduring\n22\nthe year then in effect sums which would have gone to swell the year's\nprofits are represented at the end of the year by tangible\nassets, the extra\nstock-in-trade which they have been spent to buy; and similar reasoning will\napply if the amount of stock-in-trade\nhas decreased. So to omit the\nstock-in-trade would give a false result\". There is no reason to doubt that it\nwas for these reasons\nthat the South African legislation too requires opening\nand closing trading stock to be taken into account when determining taxable\nincome derived from carrying on any trade in any year of assessment. Certainly,\nno other reasons have been suggested. See the case\nof\nNemoiim\n, supra, at\n956G -957A.\nHow it came about that the narrower view of what constituted trading stock or\nstock-in-trade gave way to the wider view now taken\nin both Australia and South\nAfrica is also explained. In the\n23\nAustralian legislation \"trading stock\" is defined as including\n\"anything\nproduced, manufactured, acquired or purchased for purposes\nof\nmanufacture, sale or exchange, and also includes live stock\".\nStephen J\nsaid:\n\"In deciding this question one notes, at the outset, that the statutory meaning,\nby including in 'trading stock' things acquired\nnot only for purposes of sale or\nexchange but also for purposes of manufacture, enlarges the ordinary meaning of\nthe term. Dictionary\nmeanings of 'stock', in the sense of stock-in-trade or\ntrading stock, generally involve the concept of being kept on hand by a trader\nfor sale by him and would not extend so as to include raw materials acquired for\npurposes of manufacture. The inclusion of live stock\neffects a further\nenlargement of the meaning of trading stock, a dairy farmer's milking herd,\nalthough 'live stock', would not be\ntrading stock as ordinarily understood\". (At\n454.)\nMason J\nsaid:\n\"It has been suggested that the definition contained in s 6(1) of the Act, to\nthe extent to which it refers to anything 'acquired\nor purchased for the\npurposes of manufacture', represents an extension of the accepted meaning of the\nterm. No doubt it is correct\nto say that historically 'trading stock' and\n'stock-in-trade' denoted the stock of goods acquired by a trader or dealer\nand\n24\nheld for sale. Even today it would be correct to speak of the trading stock\nor stock-in-trade of Steptoe & Son. But whereas both\nexpressions may have\nhad this limited meaning in times gone by, trading stock has acquired a more\nextensive denotation in modern\ntimes. It is a commercial term, ordinarily\nemployed by accountants and auditors and it is to usage by commercial men that\nwe must\nlook in determining what it signifies, rather than to standard\ndictionaries which so often fail to reflect current usage and just\nas frequently\nfail to reflect modern commercial usage.\nAs applied to the business of a manufacturer of goods, accountants and\ncommercial men by their use of the expression 'trading stock'\ndenote not only\nthe goods which he has manufactured and holds for sale but his stock of raw\nmaterials, components and partly manufactured\ngoods.\nWhiteman and Wheatcroft\non Income Tax,\n2nd ed (1976) p 444, under the heading 'Stock-in-Trade and\nWork in Progress', say:\n'A manufacturer who buys raw materials, processes them and sells the finished\nproduct will normally have on hand some unused raw\nmaterials, some partly\nmanufactured goods and some finished goods awaiting sale. The first and last are\nstock, the partly processed\ngoods being sometimes called stock and sometimes\nwork in progress. In addition, a manufacturer may have on hand goods which he\nconsumes\nin the course of his manufacture, such as coal; this is also regarded\nas stock'.\n25\nSee also\nSimon's Taxes\n, 3rd ed, vol B, pp 411 et seq.\nThe view expressed by Whiteman and Wheatcroft is not a mere outgrowth of the\nUnited Kingdom statutory definitions to which I have\nalready referred. It is a\nreflection of commercial usage arising from the development of accounting\nprinciples over a long period\nof time. The authors refer, in support of the last\nsentence in the passage quoted, to the decision of Rowlatt J in\nGeorge\nThompson & Co Ltd v IR Comrs\n(1927) 12 TC 1091\nwhere a shipping company\nhaving contracted to purchase a quantity of coal for the purpose of running its\nships subsequently transferred\nthe benefit of the contract at a profit -when its\nships were requisitioned in 1916, there being no need for the coal. It was held\nthat the coal was bought on revenue account as consumable stores as part of the\nbusiness and that therefore the profit was taxable.\nIn effect the coal was\ntreated as part of the taxpayer's trading stock.\nThe recognition by accountants and commercial men that raw material used for\nthe purpose of manufacture in a manufacturing business\nand partly manufactured\ngoods form part of the trading stock of the business was an almost inevitable\ndevelopment. It enabled the\nvalue of raw materials and partly manufactured goods\nto be included in the value of trading stock at the beginning and end of an\naccounting period and by this means it led to the making or a more accurate\ncalculation of the profit earned or the loss sustained\nin that period. It is not\neasy to see how an accurate calculation of profit or loss could be made\n26\nunless the value of raw materials and partly manufactured goods was taken\ninto account. Of course the value might be taken into account,\neven though by\ndifferent means. Partly manufactured goods may be dealt with as 'work in\nprogress', as indeed they are sometimes,\nbut this expression is no more than an\nalternative description except in so far as it is intended to introduce\ndifferent methods\nof valuation.\nIn this respect I agree with Aickin J that\nthe House of Lords in\nOstime (Insp of Taxes) v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd\n[1961] UKHL 6\n;\n(1961) 1 WLR 739\ndid not treat work in progress as being essentially different\nfrom trading stock. Their Lordships used the expression 'work in progress'\nas an\nalternative description for partly manufactured goods which, like raw materials\nand completed goods, form part of the trading\nstock of a business and which, as\nthat case illustrates, give rise to special problems of valuation. At 751, Lord\nReid. with whose\njudgment Lord Tucker and Lord Hodson agreed, said:\n'Suppose that the manufacture of an article was completed near the end of an\naccounting period. If completed the day before that\ndate the article, if not\nalready sold, has become stock-in-trade, if completed the day after that date it\nwas still work in progress\non that date'.\nIn\nHenderson v FC of\nT\n(1969) 119 CLR 612\nat 635;\n1 ATR 133\nat 146, Windeyer J, after referring\nto this statement, said:\n27\n'These propositions relate to 'work in progress' as a synonym for tangible\nthings, goods in process of manufacture from raw materials,\nthings which when\ncompleted will become stock-in-trade'.\nThese observations were\ndirected to the question whether the\nstock of partly manufactured goods is to\nbe treated for taxation !\npurposes in the same fashion as completed goods and\nto this\nquestion an affirmative answer was returned. The expression\n'work\nin progress' was used to differentiate goods in the former\nfrom those in the latter category. It is, I think, taking too much\nfrom what was said to conclude that these statements positively\nexpress the view that goods in process of manufacture are\nexcluded from 'trading stock'. If they go so far, I would, with\nrespect, disagree with them. The wide view of the ordinary\ndenotation of 'trading stock' is not something which is peculiar\nto the United Kingdom and foreign to Australia. In 1 CTBR\n(NS) Case 120 at 572, the Chairman, Mr Gibson, observed that\nhe had little doubt that raw materials came to be regarded long\nago commercially as trading stock.\nIt has been pointed out previously that, unlike the United\nKingdom income tax legislation, the Act does not provide for\nthe assessment of tax on the profits or gains of a business -\nsee\nCommercial & General Acceptance Ltd v FC of T\n(1977)\n[1977] HCA 47\n;\n7 ATR 716\nat 720-1;\n16 ALR 267\nat 272-3, and the cases\ncited;\nJ Rowe & Son (Pty)Ltd v FC of T\n[1971] HCA 80\n;\n(1971) 124 CLR 421\nat 450-1;\n2 ATR 497\nat 500-1. One consequence of this\n28\ndifference is that some accounting principles and practices\nwhich have been held to be appropriate in the ascertainment of\na taxpayer's profit may have no application here because our\nstatutory provisions specifically instruct us as to what constitutes\nassessable income and as to the items that shall be allowed as\ndeductions from that income. The trading stock provisions\ncontained in ss 28 to 36 are a case in point. Accounting\nprinciple and practice cannot prevail over them. However, as\nthe definition of 'trading stock' contained in s 6(1) is not an\nexclusive definition, it requires us to give effect to the ordinary,\nand in this case that happens to be the commercial, meaning of\nthe expression, notwithstanding that in part at least it is a\nmeaning which may have derived from or may have been\ninfluenced by accounting principle or practice.\nIf trading stock according to its ordinary meaning denotes land\nas well as goods and commodities, it must follow that land may\nform part of the trading stock of a business before it has been\nconverted into the condition in which it is intended to be sold.\nJust as raw materials and partly manufactured goods form part\nof the trading stock of a manufacturer, so also virgin land which\nhas been acquired by a land developer for the purpose of\nimprovement, subdivision and sale in the form of allotments will i\nform part of his trading stock\". (At 461-462)\nAickin J\nsaid nothing inconsistent with the views of\nStephen J\nand\nMason\nJ\n.\n29\nI did not understand counsel for appellants to contest during oral argument\nthe rationale for the existence of provisions such as\nsec 22 read with the\nextended definition of trading stock in sec 1 of the Act. In the heads of\nargument filed by appellants it had\nbeen contended that the decision of this\ncourt in\nDe Beers Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner for Inland Revenue\n1986(1) SA 8(A) showed at 32 E-F that the definition of trading stock in sec 1\nshould be interpreted in such a way that only that\nwhich would ordinarily have\nbeen regarded as trading stock or stock-in-trade falls within its ambit.\nHowever, during oral argument\ncounsel for appellant frankly conceded that in\nmaking that submission in the heads of argument, the impact of the use of the\nword\n\"comprehend\" in the following passage in the judgment was not sufficiently\ntaken into account:\n\"\t the definition would seem to comprehend what is\n30\nordinarily understood by the term trading stock\". (At 33 C.) If the entire\nsentence (of which the above passage is but a part) in\nthe judgment is read, it\nis plain that the court did not intend to convey that the meaning to be given to\nthe words \"trading stock\"\nhad to be so confined. The court was concerned with a\ndifferent question, namely, whether or not the definition was exhaustive.\nWhile accepting that the definition had the effect of\nencompassing things\nwhich would or might not ordinarily be regarded\nas trading stock, counsel for\nappellants submitted that it should not be\ninterpreted as encompassing that\nwhich has no separate identity and\nvalue as a saleable article, or product,\nor commodity. He contended\nthat that is especially so in the case of anything\nmanufactured. He\nemphasised the use of the word \"anything\" in the definition\nand\ncontended that that part of the definition which reads \"anything\n31\nthe proceeds from the disposal of which forms or will form part of his gross\nincome\" shows that a saleable product was contemplated.\nIt was suggested that\nthe reference in sec 22(1) of the Act to a possible diminution in the value by\nreason of a \"decrease in the\nmarket value\" of trading stock held by the\ntaxpayer, and the reference in sec 22 (4) to trading stock being deemed in the\ncircumstances\nthere set out to have been acquired \"at a cost equal to the\ncurrent market price of such trading stock on the date on which it was\nacquired\"\nstrengthened the contention. A \"purposive\" approach to the interpretation of the\ndefinition of trading stock, such as that\ndescribed in\nPublic Carriers\nAssociation and Others v Toll Road Concessionaries (Pty) Ltd and Others\n1990(1) SA 925(A) at 943C - 944D, was submitted to be appropriate because of the\ngenerality of the language employed in the definition\nand the need to restrict\nthe meaning to be assigned to it so\n32\nas to achieve the purpose of the legislature, without at the same time\ndubbing as trading stock things which there could be no sensible\nlegislative\npurpose in treating as trading stock. As I have said, the contention was that\nthe purpose of the legislation was to ensure\nthat only saleable or realisable\nstock is brought to account. The corollary of the submission was that if\nsomething is merely in\nthe process of being \"produced, manufactured, purchased\nor in any other manner acquired\" by the taxpayer and it has as yet no realisable\nvalue, it cannot be regarded as trading stock within the meaning of the\ndefinition. The use of the past tense in the definition (\"produced\",\n\"manufactured\", \"purchased\" or \"acquired\") showed, so it was argued, that if\nwhat was acquired or manufactured was what counsel called\n\"part of a continuous\nprocess of acquisition or manufacture\", it could not fall within the definition\nbecause the process was incomplete.\nI\n33\ninterpolate here en passant that this would result in what is referred to in\nEngland and Australia as work-in-progress being largely,\nif not entirely,\nexcluded from the statutory concept of trading stock.\nA further submission made by counsel for appellant\nwas\nthat it was inherent in the concept in the\ndefinition of \"anything\nthe proceeds from the disposal of which forms or will\nform part of his gross income\" that a saleable or realisable thing was\ncontemplated because there could be no talk of proceeds if\nthat were not so, and\n\"to hold otherwise would mean that a taxpayer would be obliged to pay tax on the\ndeemed value of something\nwhich at that stage is not realisable by him\".\nIt was contended that the particular stockpiles in issue did not comply with\nthe interpretation of the relevant provisions postulated\nby counsel for\nappellants and that they were therefore rightly\n34\ndisregarded by appellants in calculating their taxable income. The particular\nstockpiles disregarded are listed below with a brief\naccompanying description of\nwhat they contained.\nTisand's Stockpiles\nStockpile No 1\n-\nHeavy Mineral\nConcentrate (HMC) Stockpile\nThis is situated close to the dredging pond and it consists of heavy mineral\nconcentrate which has been separated from the dredged\nsand. The heavy mineral\nconcentrate is mainly a mixture of ilmenite, rutile, zircon and monazite.\nStockpile No 2\n-\n\"Sunday\" Stockpile\nThis too consists of heavy mineral concentrate and is a reserve supply.\nStockpile No 4\n-\nZircon/Rutile Stockpile\nThis consists of a mixture of rutile and zircon derived from the processing\nof heavy mineral concentrate in a minerals separation\nplant.\nStockpile No 5\n-\nLow Susceptible Rejects Stockpile\nThis is a residual mixture of ilmenite, monazite,\n35\nrutile and zircon which is subjected thereafter to further processes designed\nto separate the four minerals from one another.\nREIT's\nStockpiles\nStockpile No 10\n-\nIlmenite Feedstock\nStockpile\nThis is also described as smelter feed. It is ilmenite from which calcium and\nchrome have been removed by a roasting and magnetic\nprocess. It is a composite\nof titanium and iron oxide which is destined for the smelter.\nStockpile No\n10(a)\n-\nFurnace Charge Stockpile\nThis is a blend of ilmenite feedstock (smelter feed) from Stockpile 10 and\nchar derived from the heating of anthracite. It is this\nblend which goes to the\nfurnace and yields titania slag (titanium dioxide) and molten iron. Counsel for\nappellants submitted that\nthese stockpiles\nwere not realisable or saleable assets in the form in which they were\nand had no market value as such, that they represented no more than\n36\nparticular phases of a continuous process of production or manufacture or\n\"bulges in the pipeline\", that they all required to be subjected\nto yet further\nprocessing before anything capable of being sold or realised would emerge, and\nthat it could never have been intended\nthat this continuous process should be\nnotionally halted at the end of a tax year, and that these stockpiles should be\nassigned a\n\"completely artificial value\". He suggested that if the legislature\nhad intended anything which was being used in a process of manufacture\nto be\nregarded as trading stock, it would have employed the language which it had used\nelsewhere in the Act to so describe such things.\nHe pointed out that there are\nother provisions in the Act in which the legislature has used the expression\n\"used in a process of\nmanufacture\" and suggested that its choice of different\nlanguage in the definition indicated that it did not intend to include anything\nused in a process of manufacture.\n37\nAn alternative argument was presented along the following lines. Even if a\n\"strictly literal\" interpretation be given to the definition,\nthe stockpiles\nwould still not fall within it because they were not \"created\" (counsel's word)\nfor the purpose of \"manufacture, sale,\nor exchange\" (the relevant words in the\ndefinition). None was created for sale or exchange. Stockpiles Nos 1, 2, 4 and 5\nwere created\nfor the purpose of separating their contents into their constituent\nparts. That process is not a manufacturing process but a mining\nprocess falling\nwithin the definition of \"mining\" in sec 1 of the Act. The same applies to\nStockpile 10 which is acquired by REIT\nfrom Tisand for beneficiation, namely,\nconversion of the ilmenite to titania slag and high purity iron. The process\nentails winning\ntitania slag from ilmenite which is a constituent of the soil.\nStockpile 10(a) is (but for the char, which is not in issue) in the\nsame\ncategory.\n38\nBecause none of the stockpiles are disposed of in a way which will\nresult directly in the receipt of any \"proceeds\", but are disposed of by\n|\nbeing utilised in a further stage of a continuous process, they cannot fall\nwithin that part of the definition which relates to \"anything\nthe proceeds from the disposal of which forms or\nwill form part of his\ngross income\".\nIn yet another alternative argument, it was contended that respondent had\nfailed to apply his mind to whether or not there had been\na reduction in the\nvalue of the stockpiles by reason of, inter alia, a \"decrease in the market\nvalue\" thereof. It was submitted that\nthe value had decreased to nil and that\nthe question should be referred back to respondent for consideration in terms of\nsec 22(1)\nof the Act.\nThe court\na quo\nconcluded that there was no scope for a purposive\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions because there was\n39\nno uncertainty or ambiguity lurking in the language used by the legislature.\nIt rejected the suggestion that it had been held by this\ncourt in the\nDe\nBeers Holdings\ncase supra, that the definition of trading stock encompassed\nno more than what would ordinarily have been included in that term.\nIt drew\nattention to the breadth of the definition and concluded that it embraced\n\"considerably more than what would otherwise be\nunderstood thereby\". The\nevidence established in its view that the stockpiles in issue were \"produced\" or\n\"manufactured\" by appellants\n\"for purposes of manufacture\" within the meaning of\nthe definition.\nIn considering appellants' contention that the stockpiles had no value for\nthe purposes of sec 22, the court\na quo\nwas prepared to assume that the\nmaterial in the stockpiles was unsaleable in its then condition and that there\nwas no market for\nit. Even if the stockpiles\n40\ncould properly be described as \"bulges in the pipeline\" of production (which\nit doubted), the court regarded that as irrelevant because\nthey would none the\nless fall squarely within the first part of the definition. The assumed absence\nof any market for the stockpiles\nin the state in which they were was thought to\nbe of no consequence. So was the absence of any intent on the part of appellants\nto\nsell them. That they | had a considerable value to appellants seemed to the\ncourt to be quite plain, at least for as long as appellants\ncontinued their\noperations and did not terminate them abruptly. The court did not elaborate but\nI take it that what it had in mind\nwas that appellants had expended time, effort\nand money in accumulating what was in those stockpiles; they contained materials\nwhich\nafter further processing could be profitably marketed; if the stockpiles\nwere for any reason to be lost or destroyed, appellants\nwould have sustained a\nloss occasioned by the\n41\nfact that the money, time and effort spent in establishing the stockpiles\nwould have been spent fruitlessly and the potential profit\nwhich they stood to\nmake on the sale of their contents after further processing would also have been\nlost.\nThe court\na quo\nwent on to say that sub-secs 22(1) and (3) do\nnot refer to the market value of trading stock but to the cost price of such\nstock.\nSuch cost price is defined in sec 22(3) (a) as being\n\"the cost incurred\tin acquiring such trading stock, plus,\nsubject to the provisions of paragraph (b), any further costs incurred\nin getting such trading stock into its then existing condition\nand location\". The Court pointed out that those were the very costs which had\nbeen quantified by appellants when respondent required\nthe value of the\nstockpiles to be calculated. It concluded that the stockpiles had at least that\nvalue for the purposes of sec 22.\n42\nThe contention that respondent had failed to consider reducing the value of\nthe stockpiles pursuant to the discretion vested in him\nby sec 22(1) and that\nthe matter should be remitted to him for consideration was rejected. The court\na quo\nsaid that the question had never been raised until the hearing of\nargument and that respondent himself had had no opportunity of\nresponding to the\nallegation that he had failed to consider the question. It queried whether in\nthe absence of any provision enabling\nappellants to appeal against a failure to\nexercise such a discretion, it was within the power of the Income Tax Special\nCourt to\nentertain what amounted to a review of respondent's alleged failure. It\nthought that what little there was before it suggested that\nrespondent had\nconsidered the matter and it added that prima facie there were grounds upon\nwhich a refusal to reduce the value could\nbe justified. In the result, the\nappeals were dismissed and the assessments\n43\nconfirmed.\nWere the stockpiles trading stock?\nSome preliminary\nobservations about the scope of the definition seem appropriate. As was observed\nin the\nDe Beers Holdings\ncase supra, the definition may be notionally and\ngrammatically divided into two parts. The first part lays emphasis upon the\npurpose\nfor which anything may have been produced, manufactured, purchased or in\nany other manner acquired by a taxpayer. The specified purposes\nare manufacture,\nsale or exchange by the taxpayer or on his behalf. The second part makes no\ndirect reference to any purpose which\nthe taxpayer must have had at the time of\nacquisition; it postulates an objective assessment, namely, whether, if the\nthing under\nconsideration was disposed of, the proceeds would form part of his\ngross income. The first part, in so far as it refers to\n44\nthe purpose of sale or exchange, envisages that upon disposal of the thing in\nquestion something will be received in return, either\nmoney or some other quid\npro quo. To that extent, the definition is consistent with the general thrust of\nthe argument of counsel\nfor appellants that what is contemplated is anything\nwhich has an independent existence and value as a saleable or exchangeable\narticle,\nproduct or commodity. But the argument falls foul of other aspects of\nthe definition. The first part of the definition also includes\n\"anything\nproduced, manufactured, purchased or in any other manner acquired by a\ntaxpayer for purposes of manufacture\tby him or on his\nbehalf\". Those words are quite plain and unambiguous. It is inherent in them\nthat, in order to fall within the definition, what the\ntaxpayer produces,\nmanufactures, purchases or otherwise acquires need not be intended to be\ndisposed of in the state in which it\nthen is. It suffices\n45\nthat it is intended to be used for the purpose of manufacturing something.\nNor does it matter whether or not that which is intended\nto be used, is capable\nof realisation or sale in the state in which it then is. Whether it is so\nrealisable or not, there will be\nno contemplation of receiving any quid pro quo\nfor it in the state in which it then is. The fact that it may be saleable in its\nthen\nstate and have an ascertainable market value is not what brings it into the\nfirst part of the definition because it was not produced,\nmanufactured,\npurchased or in any other manner acquired for sale or exchange. What brings it\ninto the definition notwithstanding\nthat its sale or exchange was not\ncontemplated, is its intended use for purposes of manufacture. To illustrate: a\nmanufacturer of\nsewing machines may purchase or manufacture screws for the sole\npurpose of using them in the manufacture of the sewing machines.\nThe screws may\nhave an\n46\nascertainable market value and a functional existence separate from, and\nindependent of, the sewing machines, yet they would not be\ntrading stock for the\npurposes of the definition, but for their intended use in the manufacture of the\nsewing machines. The same\nmanufacturer may purchase or produce or manufacture\nfor incorporation in the sewing machines a custom made part which is not capable\nof use by anyone other than himself, and has no value to anyone other than\nhimself. While it may have a separate physical existence,\nit has no independent\nfunctional utility capable of being turned to account in any other way. It may\neven have no value as scrap.\nYet it falls within the plain and unambiguous\nlanguage of the definition. Once it is obvious, as I think it is, that the\nlegislature\nhas deliberately chosen to extend the concept of trading stock\nbeyond its colloquial ambit so as to include things which the taxpayer\nhas\nno\n47\nintention of disposing of as separate entities, but intends to use solely for\nthe purpose of manufacturing something else in which\nhe trades, there is little,\nif any, scope for a purposive interpretation of the provisions. In any event,\nwhat, one may ask, is the\nmore restricted purpose which is so apparent that\neffect should be given to it? In my view, there is none.\nThe suggested\ndifficulty in identifying and ascribing a value to things in the process of\nbeing manufactured on the last day of the\ntax year does not entitle the court to\ndisregard the plain language of the definition. Moreover, the difficulty strikes\nme as being\nmore apparent than real. Certainly in other tax jurisdictions the\nlegislators and the courts have not baulked at the concept of valuing\nwork-in-progress and there is no reason to suppose that the South African\nparliament was daunted by the prospect. As has been noted,\n48\nappellants themselves encountered no great difficulty in doing so when\nrequired by respondent to do so.\nA fundamental weakness in the argument of\ncounsel for appellants, in my view, is that it postulates that something which\nis plainly\ntrading stock by definition when acquired, purchased, produced or\nmanufactured will cease to be regarded as such the moment it commences\nbeing\nintegrated or incorporated in that which is in the process of being\nmanufactured. Once it is clear (as it is) that, for example,\nraw materials\npurchased for purpose of manufacture must be regarded as trading stock even\nalthough they have not been purchased for\nthe purpose of selling or exchanging\nthem, and once it is clear (as it is) that the rationale for requiring them to\nbe so regarded\nis to obtain a more accurate calculation of the profit earned or\nthe loss sustained during the year, it would make little sense to\nignore the\nvalue of the\n49\nraw materials utilised in such partly manufactured goods as may be on hand.\nIt would result, not in the true reflection of the taxpayer's\ntrading fortunes\nwhich the legislation is designed to produce, but in a distorted reflection of\nthem. In short, it entails ignoring\nwork in progress despite the fact that it\nmay have very great value, and despite the fact that the cost of producing it\nhas not been\nignored but, on the contrary, brought to account as an expense\nincurred. I can find no warrant in the language used by the legislature\nfor\nattributing any such inconsistency of approach to the legislature:\nI do not consider that the use of the past tense (\"produced\", \"manufactured\",\n\"purchased\" or \"acquired\") in the definition can be\ninvested with the\nsignificance suggested by counsel for appellants. A thing produced or\nmanufactured for the purposes of manufacture\nis manifestly something which is\nintended to be used in\n50\na process of manufacture, yet it plainly falls within the definition. It will\ncontinue to be regarded as trading stock until the process\nof manufacture for\nuse in which it was itself manufactured, is complete. Only then will its\nclassification as trading stock in its\nown right cease, and that will be simply\nbecause it will have become an integral part of the finished product which, in\nits completed\nstate, represents a newly created item of trading stock in which\nthe value of such trading stock as may have been used in its manufacture\nis\nsubsumed.\nNor do I consider that the second part of the definition shows that in the\nfirst part only a product saleable in its own right is\ncontemplated. The Erst\npart certainly includes things saleable in their own right. The very fact that\nit contemplates a thing which\nhas been purchased by the taxpayer carries with it\nan implication of saleability. But there is no justification for implying the\nquality of saleability\n51\nwhen it comes to anything produced or manufactured for purposes of\nmanufacture. Such a thing may or may not be saleable in its own\nright, but\nnothing in the language used by the legislature would justify the drawing of a\ndistinction between those things which\nare saleable and those which are not and\nthe regarding of only things saleable in their own right as trading stock. As\npointed out\nearlier, it would also be inimical to the attainment of the object\nwhich the legislation is designed to achieve, namely, a true reflection\nof the\ntaxpayer's trading fortunes.\nThe references in sec 22(1) to a \"decrease in market value\" and in sec 22(4)\nto \"current market price\" do not appear to me to provide\nany support for the\ninterpretation contended for by counsel for appellants. A decrease in market\nvalue is but one of a number of\nfactors listed in sec 22(1) which may be taken\ninto account by the\n52\nCommissioner in deciding whether or not to allow a taxpayer to reduce the\nvalue of trading stock held by him at the close of the tax\nyear to below the\ncost price (as defined) to him of such stock. What requires to be emphasised, is\nthat what the Commissioner is\nempowered to do is to allow the taxpayer to deduct\nan amount thought by the Commissioner to be just and reasonable \"as representing\nthe\namount by which the value of such trading stock\thas been\ndiminished\". The value which must have diminished by reason of any of the\nlisted factors is obviously the pre-existing value. That\npreexisting value is\nthe cost price (as defined) to the taxpayer of the relevant trading stock. If\nthe factors listed have not caused\nthe trading stock to fall below the cost\nprice of such trading stock to the taxpayer, there would appear to be no warrant\nfor allowing\nthe taxpayer to deduct an amount \"representing the amount by which\nthe value of such\n53\ntrading stock\t has been diminished\" because no such\ndiminution would have\noccurred in fact. Merely because a decrease in the market value of goods which a\ntrader purchased for resale\nhas occurred will not necessarily mean that he is\nentitled to be allowed to make an equivalent deduction; it is only to the extent\nthat the market price falls below the cost price (as defined) which he paid for\nthe goods that a deduction would be permissible.\nTo grant a deduction to cater\nfor a non-existent diminution of value of goods in the trader's hands, would be\nto falsify his true\nfinancial position. The same would apply to any of the other\npossible causes of diminution of value listed in sec 22(1).\nIn any event, the fact that one of the possible causes of a diminution in\nmarket value mentioned in sec 22(1) is a decrease in market\nvalue, provides no\nlogical basis for the assumption that sec\n54\n22(1) is concerned only with saleable things. All the other potential causes\nof a diminution in value of trading stock (damage, deterioration,\nchange in\nfashion, any other reason satisfactory to the Commissioner) are potentially\nquite capable of application to work in progress\neven although such work in\nprogress may have no market value.\nAs for the reference to \"current market price\" in sec 22(4), that too is no\nindication that trading stock can comprehend only saleable\nthings. It can\nobviously only be applied if a current market price is ascertainable. This\nprovision is to deal with a case in which\ntrading stock has been acquired for no\nconsideration or for a consideration which is not measurable in terms of money.\nIt will follow\nthat nothing which could be claimed as a deduction by the\ntaxpayer will have been expended on its acquisition and, from the\nS5\npoint of view of the fiscus, there is therefore not the same imperative need\nto value the corresponding benefit and to take it into\naccount when assessing\nthe taxpayer's liability for tax. If therefore cases should arise in which it is\nnot possible to value certain\ntrading stock, that is a consequence to which the\nlegislature must be taken to have resigned itself.\nIt is true that the\nlegislature has employed the expression\n\"used in a process of manufacture\" in\nsome of the other provisions of\nthe Act and that it did not use it in the\ndefinition of \"trading stock\" but\nthe legislature does not always use exactly\nthe same language to\nconvey the same notion. As long as the words which it\nhas chosen to\nuse convey plainly and unambiguously the same notion, nothing\ncan\nbe made of the point. I consider that the words \"for purposes\nof\nmanufacture\tby him or on his behalf in the definition\n56\ncan only mean \"for use in manufacture\".\nThe method of assessment of the\nvalue of trading stock as defined which is prescribed in sec 22(1), (2) and (3)\nalso shows, I think,\nthat the legislature contemplated that the trading stock\nwhich may have to be valued in a given case may consist of work in progress.\nThose provisions make the cost price to the taxpayer of the trading stock the\nbasic measure of value but recognise firstly, that\n\"further costs\" may have been\n\"incurred\" by the taxpayer, inter alia, \"in getting such trading stock into its\nthen existing condition\"\nand therefore have to be included, and secondly, that\nthere exist generally accepted accounting practices by reference to which it\nmay\nbe determined whether or not any particular further cost is one which should be\nincluded in the valuation of the trading stock\nin question. It is common cause\nthat there existed at the time, and still exists, a\n57\ngenerally accepted accounting practice approved by respondent and known as AC\n108. That provides for the valuation of \"work in progress\"\nas a component of\n\"stock\". It is described as stock \"in the process of production for sale\". The\nhistorical cost of stock is defined\nas \"the aggregate of cost of purchase, cost\nof conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present\nlocation\nand condition\". The \"cost of conversion\" is defined as \"the cost that\nrelates to bringing the stock to its present location and condition\".\nIt is\nclear from AC 108 that costs such as, for example, materials and labour, are to\nbe taken into account when valuing stock. It\nis therefore generally accepted in\naccounting practice that there will be an ascertainable value attaching to\nthings which are still\nin the process of being manufactured and are not yet\nsaleable.\nThe contentions which rested upon the proposition that the\n58\nstockpiles in question were not \"produced\" or \"manufactured\" within the\nmeaning of the definition of trading stock but were \"mined\"\nwithin the meaning\nof the definition of \"mining\" in sec 1 were not pressed in oral argument by\ncounsel for appellants. He conceded\nthat save possibly for the initial dredging\noperation, he could not argue with any conviction that in carrying out any of\nthe ensuing\nprocesses which resulted in the existence of the stockpiles,\nappellants had not \"produced\" or \"manufactured\" them \"for the purposes\nof\nmanufacture\" within the meaning of the definition of trading stock in sec 1. It\nis therefore unnecessary to detail the evidence\ngiven in regard to those\nprocesses; it suffices to say that it establishes that the processes do indeed\nfall within the definition.\nIt is also unnecessary to consider the contention of\ncounsel for respondent that the point was not made in appellants' grounds of\nobjection, that far from there being any\n59\napplication to the court\na quo\nto allow an amendment of the notice of\nobjection, appellants' objection had been argued on the basis that the\nstockpiles in question\nwere indeed produced by manufacturing operations, and\nthat as a consequence appellants are barred by sec 83(7) (c) of the Act from\nraising the contention that the stockpiles were mining stocks.\nI conclude\ntherefore that the court\na quo\nwas correct in holding that the relevant\nstockpiles were trading stock as defined.\nThe alternative claim for remittal\nof the matter to respondent.\nWhat actually happened in this regard is\nshrouded in obscurity. It is not entirely clear whether respondent did or did\nnot give consideration\nto the question of whether appellants should be permitted\nto reduce the value of the relevant stockpiles for any of the reasons set\nforth\nin sec 22(1). His reply to the notices of objection is a pro forma rejection\n60\nof the objections raised. If he did consider the question and if he concluded\nthat no reduction should be permitted, counsel for appellants\nconcedes that\nappellants would have no redress in either the court a\nquo\nor this court.\nHad appellants pertinently alleged that respondent had failed to consider their\nrequest for a reduction in their notice\nof objection, or made that allegation in\nother proceedings designed to compel respondent to consider their request,\nrespondent would\nhave responded to the allegation and what had actually happened\nwould have become known. It is true that in the course of his argument\nbefore\nthe court\na quo\nrespondent's representative submitted that the respondent\nhad not considered the question but that was merely a submission made without\nreference to respondent in response to a contention raised for the first time in\nargument by counsel for appellants that respondent\nhad not considered allowing a\nreduction in\n61\nvalue. The context in which the submission was made was that a number of tax\nyears had gone by in none of which had appellants reflected\nthe stockpiles in\nquestion as trading stock. It followed that appellants had never asked\nrespondent in those tax years to allow the\nvalue of the stockpiles to be\nreduced, and that respondent could obviously not have considered any such\nrequest then. It is far from\nclear that respondent's representative was basing\nhis submissions on anything more than inferences drawn by himself. The only\noccasion\nwhen anything resembling a pertinent request to respondent to consider\nallowing a reduction in value of the relevant stockpiles was\nmade by appellants,\nwas after the assessments for those tax years had been made. The form which the\n\"request\" took was in reality\nmore in the nature of a contention designed to\nreinforce the primary contention that those stockpiles were not trading stock as\ndefined\nbecause they\n62\nwere not saleable in that state and therefore had no market value. For all I\nknow, respondent considered the contention and rejected\nit. Prima facie, and\nwithout purporting to express any definite opinion upon the question, there are\ngrounds which could justify\na rejection of the contention. It was the\nappellant's contention that the stockpiles had never had any market value, not\nthat since\nthe creation of the stockpiles there had been a diminution in their\nvalue by reason of a decrease in market value. It is therefore\ndifficult to see\nupon what basis a reduction in the defined value of the stockpiles could have\nbeen founded. However that may be,\nI share the view of the court a\nquo\nthat a complaint of this nature cannot be entertained given the failure of\nappellants to raise it pertinently in a manner which would\nhave required\nrespondent to respond to it.\nIn the result, the appeals are dismissed with costs and the\n63\nassessments are confirmed. It was common cause that the costs of\ntwo\ncounsel should be allowed. It is noted for the benefit of the\ntaxing\nmaster that only one counsel was engaged to draft respondent's\nheads\nof argument.\nR M MARAIS\nCORBETT CJ\nBOTHA )\nEKSTEEN ) JJA\nHOWIE ) Concur",

    "facts": "The appellants, Richards Bay Iron & Titanium (Pty) Ltd (REIT) and Tisand (Pty) Ltd, operate a joint mineral extraction and beneficiation complex at Richards Bay. Their process creates a series of material stockpiles (numbered 1‑13) representing various stages of heavy mineral concentrate, intermediate products and unfinished smelter feed. In the tax years ending 31 December 1987‑1990 the appellants prepared their income‑tax returns but omitted the value of certain stockpiles from trading income, deducting only the expenses incurred to produce them. The Commissioner added amounts to the taxable income, treating the stockpiles as “closing stock in respect of work in progress” or “increase in work‑in‑progress stock”. The appellants argued the stockpiles were not trading stock and therefore should not be valued for tax purposes.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the material stockpiles described in the appellants’ operations fall within the definition of “trading stock” under section 1 of the Income Tax Act and, consequently, must be taken into account under section 22. 2. Whether the Commissioner may reduce the amount attributed to such stockpiles under the discretion afforded by section 22(1). 3. Whether the assessments made by the Commissioner should be confirmed or set aside.",
    "principles": "The court considered the definition of “trading stock” in s 1, which includes anything produced, manufactured, purchased or otherwise acquired for purposes of manufacture, sale or exchange, and the provision in s 22 that the value of trading stock is its cost price plus allowable further costs. Pre‑cedents such as Commissioner v Nemojim, De Beers Holdings and the Australian case St Hubert’s Island were cited to illustrate that work‑in‑progress and raw materials intended for manufacture are to be treated as trading stock to give a true reflection of taxable profit. The court rejected a narrow “saleable‑only” interpretation and affirmed that the legislature intended a broader commercial meaning, encompassing items not yet saleable but destined for further processing.",
    "application": "Applying the statutory definition and the cited authorities, the court held that the appellants’ stockpiles were produced for the purpose of manufacture and therefore qualify as trading stock. The cost of acquiring and processing those stockpiles formed the relevant cost price under s 22(3)(a). The court found no basis for the Commissioner to reduce their value, as the stockpiles retained a cost price that had not been diminished below that amount. Consequently, the Commissioner’s adjustments adding the value of the stockpiles to taxable income were upheld.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of REIT and Tisand, confirmed the Commissioner’s assessments for the years in issue, and awarded costs. The stockpiles were deemed trading stock, their cost price taken into account, and no reduction in value was permitted."
