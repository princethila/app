He was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.\nHis\nappeal to the Natal Provincial Division was successful to the extent that the\nconviction was altered to one of attempted rape\nand the sentence reduced to four\nyears' imprisonment. Leave was granted to the appellant to appeal to this Court\nagainst the conviction.\nI do not propose to set out the evidence which was adduced before the trial\ncourt. It has been dealt with by the regional magistrate\nin his judgment, and\nalso by the court a quo.\nI have considered the evidence, the judgment of the\ntrial court, that of the court a quo and the arguments on behalf of the\nappellant\nand the respondent. I agree with the conclusion to which the court a\nquo came namely that the appellant was guilty of attempted rape.\nThere is in\nmy\n3\njudgment no ground upon which this Court could interfere with the judgment of\nthe court a quo, and the appeal can therefore not succeed.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nA.P. VAN COLLER ACTING JUDGE OF\nAPPEAL\nHEFER JA ] CONCUR\nSTEYN JA ]\nHEFER JA : The appeal is dismissed. /al",
