In terms of the policy the deceased\nceded to Wesbank ‘all [his] rights, title and interest in and to this\nPolicy...as collateral security for the outstanding debt in terms of the Credit\nAgreement entered into by [him] with the Credit Grantor\n[Wesbank]’.\n[4]\nA few weeks after the\nconclusion of these agreements, the deceased accidentally shot himself with his\nown firearm and, in consequence,\ndied. At the time of his death, he was still\nindebted to Wesbank under the credit\nagreement.\n[5]\nThe respondent and Wesbank duly\nnotified Hollard of a claim in terms of the policy, but Hollard rejected the\nclaim, relying on an\nexclusion clause in the policy which reads as\nfollows:\n‘1\n. EXCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO DEATH, DISABILITY AND DREAD\nDISEASE\nNo amount shall be payable if in our [Hollard’s] Opinion:-\n...\nb)\tthe claim is in any way due or traceable to, or arises directly or\nindirectly, entirely or partially from:\n...\n(ii) suicide, self-inflicted injury or self-inflicted illness, whether intended\nor not, or voluntary exposure to danger or obvious\nrisk of\ninjury.’\n[6]\nWhen\nsued in the Pretoria High Court for the benefits allegedly payable under the\npolicy, Hollard pleaded that, as the cause of the\ndeceased’s death was\n‘self-inflicted injury’, the abovementioned exclusion clause applied\nand the claim was thus\nnot covered by the policy. In addition, so it was\nalleged, as the deceased had ceded all his rights under the policy to Wesbank,\nthe respondent had no\nlocus standi\nto enforce any claim against Hollard\nin terms thereof.\n[7]\nIn the court below, the\nmatter was approached on the basis of a stated case, the common cause facts\nsimply being recorded prior to\nargument. Prinsloo AJ held that, notwithstanding\nthe cession\nin securitatem debiti\nby the deceased to Wesbank, the\nrespondent (as executor of the deceased’s estate) could enforce the ceded\nrights against Hollard,\ndespite the fact that the debt secured by the cession\nhad not been extinguished. With reference to the decision of this court in\nLeyds NO v Noord-Westelike Koöperatiewe Landboumaatskappy Bpk &\nandere\n,\n[1]\nthe learned judge\nconstrued the cession as a pledge of the rights under the policy to Wesbank (the\ncessionary), the insured (the\ncedent) retaining ownership (\ndominium\n) in\nthe ceded rights. By analogy with the ‘rule’ established in the case\nof\nNational Bank of South Africa Ltd v Cohen’s\nTrustee\n[2]\n- namely that, on the\ninsolvency of the cedent\nin securitatem debiti\n, the trustee of his or her\ninsolvent estate is entitled to enforce the ceded right and administer the\nproceeds thereof as an asset\nin the insolvent estate, subject to the\npreferential right of the cessionary as pledgee – Prinsloo AJ held that,\non the death\nof the cedent (the insured), the executor of his deceased estate\ncould enforce a claim under the policy against Hollard, subject\nto\nWesbank’s right to repayment of the amount still owing to it under the\ncredit agreement.\n[8]\nShortly before the\ncommencement of the trial, the respondent took cession of any claim Wesbank may\nhave had against Hollard under\nthe policy and amended the particulars of claim\naccordingly. In a consequential amendment to its plea, Hollard alleged that any\nclaim\nWesbank may have had under the policy had prescribed by the time of the\nattempted cession, Wesbank not having complied with a provision\nin the policy\nrequiring the institution of legal proceedings against Hollard within a\nspecified period of time. The court below rejected\nHollard’s allegations\nin this regard, construing the time bar provision in the policy as being\napplicable only to the insured.\n[9]\nAs regards\nthe reliance by Hollard on the abovementioned exclusion\nclause,\n[3]\nPrinsloo AJ was of the view\nthat ‘the most reasonable and logical ...interpretation is that all the\nacts, namely suicide, self-inflicted\ninjury, self-inflicted illness and\nvoluntary exposure to harm presuppose the common element of deliberate\nintent.’ On a ‘strict\ninterpretation’, the phrase\n‘whether intended or not’ in the exclusion clause should apply only\nto the immediately\npreceding words, ie ‘self-inflicted illness’, and\nnot to the words ‘self-inflicted injury’. According to\nthe learned\njudge-\n‘Bearing in mind the dictionary meaning of “\ninflict\n”\nand the fact that all the other actions in the exclusion clause presuppose\nintent, an interpretation that “\nself-inflicted injury\n” can be\ncontrived without intent, would appear to be incongruous. If one then relies on\nthe assistance of the\ncontra proferentem\nand\neiusdem generis\nconstructions, such an interpretation becomes far-fetched and unacceptable.\nQuite apart from the question of interpretation...the\nnotion of excluding\nliability on the ground of “\nself-inflicted injury which is not\nintended\n” can lead to absurd results. It would mean that the innocent\ninsured who falls into an uncovered manhole at night and injures\nhimself will\nnot be protected by the policy. The same applies to the innocent insured who\neats a contaminated can of sardines or\ndrives into an invisible stationary\nobject at night on the highway. In my view, such an interpretation will not be\ntolerated in the\nlight of the principles referred to\nabove.’\n[10]\nThe\ncourt concluded that the incident in which the deceased shot himself ‘by\naccident and without intent or any other form of\nfault or unreasonable exposure\nto danger’ did not fall within the ambit of the exclusion clause relied on\nby Hollard. Moreover,\neven if this interpretation of the exclusion clause was\nnot correct, the court found that Hollard’s ‘attempt to avoid\nliability by going to the preposterous extreme of including the words\n“whether intended or not” in a general exclusion\nof this nature is\ncontra bonos mores\nso that the exclusion, to that extent, is rendered\nunenforceable.’ The respondent’s claim under the policy thus\nsucceeded.\nWith the leave of the court below, Hollard appeals against all these\nfindings.\n[11]\nIn view of the conclusion to\nwhich I have come regarding the interpretation of the exclusion clause, it is\nunnecessary to deal with\nany of the other issues canvassed in the court below. I\ndeliberately refrain from expressing an opinion as to the correctness or\notherwise of the findings of Prinsloo AJ on those issues It was common cause\nthat Hollard was of the opinion that the respondent’s\nclaim fell within\nthe ambit of this clause. The respondent did not attack the reasonableness of\nthis opinion as such,\n[4]\nbut contended\nthat it was based on an incorrect interpretation of the clause in question.\nObviously, if on a proper interpretation\nof the clause – which is a matter\nof law\n[5]\n– the exclusion of\nHollard’s liability does not apply to unintentional self-inflicted\ninjuries of the kind which caused\nthe death of the deceased, then\nHollard’s opinion was wrongly formed and is consequently of no effect.\n[12]\nThe principles governing the\ninterpretation of an insurance policy were set out by this court in\nFedgen\nInsurance Ltd v Leyds\n[6]\nas\nfollows:\n'The ordinary rules relating to the\ninterpretation of contracts must be applied in construing a policy of insurance.\nA court must\ntherefore endeavour to ascertain the intention of the parties. Such\nintention is, in the first instance, to be gathered from the\nlanguage used\nwhich, if clear, must be given effect to. This involves giving the words used\ntheir plain, ordinary and popular meaning\nunless the context indicates\notherwise... Any provision which purports to place a limitation upon a clearly\nexpressed obligation\nto indemnify must be restrictively interpreted...; for it\nis the insurer's duty to make clear what particular risks it wishes to\nexclude.... A policy normally evidences the contract and an insured's\nobligation, and the extent to which an insurer's liability\nis limited, must be\nplainly spelt out. In the event of a real ambiguity the\ncontra\nproferentem\nrule, which requires a written document to be construed against\nthe person who drew it up, would operate against Fedgen as drafter\nof the\npolicy...'\nIn the\nVan Zyl NO\ncase (\nsupra\n),\nthis court also quoted\nwith approval from the judgment by King J in\nBarnard v Protea Assurance Co\nLtd t/a Protea Assurance\n[7]\nto the\nfollowing effect:\n'Now it is an accepted principle in interpreting insurance contracts that it\nis the duty of the insurer to make it clear what particular\nrisks he wishes to\nexclude. The principle is stated by May in the following terms: ''No rule in the\ninterpretation of a policy is\nmore fully established, or more imperative or\ncontrolling, than that which declares that, in all cases, it must be liberally\nconstrued\nin favour of the insured so as not to defeat without a plain necessity\nhis claim to an indemnity which in making the insurance it\nwas his object to\nsecure.'''\nAnd (at 1068D):\n'From this it would follow that if a term in a policy (''term'' in the sense\nof designation) is capable of both a broader and narrower\nmeaning it is that\nwhich is favourable to the insured, in other words to the upholding of the\npolicy, which must be employed.'\n[13]\nWith regard to the\nonus\n, the position is as\nfollows:\n[8]\n‘The ordinary rule is that the insured must prove himself to fall within\nthe primary risk insured against, whilst the onus\nis on the insurer to prove the\napplication of an exception:\nEagle Star Insurance Co Ltd v Willey\n1956\n(1) SA 330\n(A) at 334A -\n335F.’\n[14]\nIn\nview of the reasoning followed by the court below, the following\ndictum\nof this court in the even more recent case of\nMetcash Trading Ltd v\nCredit Guarantee Insurance Corporation of Africa\nLtd\n[9]\nis\napposite:\n‘“According to our law ... a policy of insurance must be construed\nlike any other written contract so as to give effect\nto the intention of the\nparties as expressed in the terms of the policy, considered as a whole. The\nterms are to be understood in\ntheir plain, ordinary and popular sense unless it\nis evident from the context that the parties intended them to have a different\nmeaning, or unless they have by known usage of trade, or the like, acquired a\npeculiar sense distinct from their popular meaning”\n(\nBlackshaws (Pty) Ltd v Constantia Insurance Co Ltd\n1983 (1) SA 120\n(A)\nat 126H–127A). If the ordinary sense of the words necessarily leads to\nsome absurdity or to some repugnance or inconsistency\nwith the rest of the\ncontract, then the Court may modify the words just so much as to avoid that\nabsurdity or inconsistency but no\nmore (\nScottish Union & National\nInsurance Co Ltd v Native Recruiting Corporation Ltd\n1934 AD 458\nat\n464–6;\nFedgen Insurance Ltd v Leyds\n1995 (3) SA 33\n(A) at\n38B–E). It must also be borne in mind that:\n“Very few words ... bear a single meaning, and the ‘ordinary’\nmeaning of words appearing in a contract will necessarily\ndepend upon the\ncontext in which they are used, their interrelation and the nature of the\ntransaction as it appears from the entire\ncontract’ (\nSassoon Confirming\nand Acceptance Co (Pty) Ltd v Barclays National Bank Ltd\n1974 (1) SA 641\n(A)\nat 646B). It is essential to have regard to the context in which the word or\nphrase is used with its interrelation to the contract\nas a whole, including the\nnature and purpose of the contract (\nCoopers & Lybrand and Others v Bryant\n[1995] ZASCA 64\n;\n1995 (3) SA 761\n(A) at 768A–B;\nAktiebolaget Hässle and Another\nv Triomed (Pty) Ltd\n2003 (1) SA 155\n(SCA) para\n1).”’\n[15]\nContrary\nto the view of Prinsloo AJ in this\nregard,\n[10]\nthe ordinary rules of\ngrammar dictate that the comma before and after the phrase ‘self-inflicted\ninjury or self-inflicted disease’\nin the exclusion clause makes the\nqualification ‘whether intended or not’ (appearing immediately after\nsuch phrase) applicable\nto both\ninstances and not\nonly to\n‘self-inflicted disease’. Counsel for the respondent conceded as\nmuch. Moreover, as counsel for Hollard correctly\ncontended, Prinsloo AJ’s\nconclusion that the kind of\nunintentional\nself-inflicted injury which had\ncaused the death of the deceased in this case was not covered by the wording of\nthe exclusion clause\neffectively negates the words ‘whether intended or\nnot’ in that clause, contrary to the general rules governing the\ninterpretation\nof\ncontracts.\n[11]\n[16]\nCounsel\nfor the respondent contended that, should the exclusion clause be interpreted so\nas to apply to the circumstances of the deceased’s\ndeath in the present\ncase, this would lead to absurd results. As indicated\nabove,\n[12]\nthe court below accepted\nthis argument. I disagree. If the words ‘self-inflicted injury or\nself-inflicted disease’ are\ninterpreted restrictively, as they must\nbe,\n[13]\nthen only injuries or\ndiseases which are\nentirely\ninflicted upon himself or herself by the\ninsured will be covered. An injury or disease which is caused\npartly\nby\nthe actions or omissions of the insured, but in conjunction with the action or\nomission of some other party or some other contributory\nfactor, will fall\noutside the ambit of the exclusion clause. In the examples of absurd\nconsequences given by Prinsloo AJ (falling\ninto an uncovered manhole, eating\ncontaminated sardines, driving into an invisible stationary object at night),\nthe injury or disease\nis inflicted on the insured only partly by his or her own\nactions. Without the intervention, whether by act or omission, of some\nother\nparty or some other contributory factor (the removal and non-replacement of the\nmanhole cover, the manufacture and/or sale\nof contaminated sardines, the leaving\nof the offending object in the path of traffic), the injury or disease would not\nhave occurred.\n[17]\nWhether or not a particular\ninjury or disease is entirely ‘self-inflicted’ will obviously depend\non the facts of that\nparticular case and, in forming its opinion in this regard,\nHollard will be obliged to act\nreasonably.\n[14]\nThe court below\nheld, in effect, that because in certain hypothetical instances, it may be\ndoubtful whether or not the injury or\ndisease was ‘self-inflicted’,\nthe words ‘whether intended or not’ in the exclusion clause should\nsimply be\nignored. In the present case, the injury was clearly\n‘self-inflicted’ in the sense discussed above and the approach of\nthe court below, in my view,\nexceeds the bounds of interpretation of\ncontracts.\n[18]\nI also do not agree with the\ncourt below that ‘including the words “whether intended or\nnot” in a general exclusion\nof this nature is\ncontra bonos mores\nso\nthat the exclusion, to that extent, is rendered unenforceable.’ Although\nthe qualification might be an unusual one, an insurer\nis entitled to\ncircumscribe the risks which are covered by the policy and to determine the\ninsurance premium accordingly.\n[15]\nIt certainly cannot be said that the respondent discharged the onus of showing\nthat the ‘clear effect’ of the exclusion\nclause, restrictively\ninterpreted as set out above, is contrary to public policy or that ‘there\nis a probability that unconscionable,\nimmoral or illegal conduct will result\nfrom the implementation of the [exclusion clause] according to [its]\ntenor’.\n[16]\n[19]\nIt\nfollows from the above that the death of the deceased fell within the ambit of\nthe exclusion clause and hence did not give rise\nto a claim in terms of the\npolicy.\nOrder\n[20]\nIn the circumstances, the\nfollowing order is made:\n(a)\tThe appeal succeeds\nwith costs.\n(b)\tThe order of the court below is set aside. In its place is substituted:\n‘The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs, including the\nqualifying fees of the defendant’s expert, Professor\nHJ\nScholtz.’\nB J VAN HEERDEN\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCONCUR:\nSCOTT JA\nMTHIYANE JA\nCONRADIE JA\nPONNAN AJA\n[1]\n1985 (2) SA 769\n(A) at\n780A-H.\n[2]\n1911 AD\n235.\n[3]\nSee para 5\nabove.\n[4]\nIt would seem that, in\nforming an opinion on whether or not the factual circumstances allegedly giving\nrise to a claim under the\npolicy fell within the ambit of the exclusion clause,\nHollard was obliged to act reasonably (see, for example, RH Christie\nThe Law\nof Contract in South Africa\n4 ed (2001) 114-115 and the cases there cited;\ncf also\nDamsell v Southern Life Association Ltd\n(1992) 13 ILJ 848 (C) at\n851G-852C and 859G).\n[5]\nSee\nVan\nZyl NO v Kiln\nNon-Marine Syndicate No 510 of Lloyds of London\n2003\n(2) SA 440\n(SCA)\npara 11 at\n447H.\n[6]\n1995 (3) SA 33\n(A) at\n38B-E (other case references omitted); recently re-affirmed by this Court in\nVan Zyl NO v Kiln Non-Marine Syndicate No 510 of Lloyds of London\n2003\n(2) SA 440\n(SCA) para 6 at\n445H-446G.\n[7]\n1998 (3) SA 1063\n(C)\nat 1068B-C.\n[8]\nVan Zyl NO v\nKiln Non-Marine Syndicate No 510 of Lloyds of London,\nabove para 7 at\n446F-G.\n[9]\n[2004] 2 All SA 484\n(SCA) para 10 at 488b-f.\n[10]\nSee\npara 9 above.\n[11]\nSee, for\nexample,\nWellworths Bazaars Ltd v Chandlers Ltd\n1947 (2) SA 37\n(A) at 43,\nwhere Davis AJA quoted with approval the following passage from\nDitcher v\nDenison\n11 Moore PC 325\nat 357: ‘\nIt is a good general rule in\njurisprudence that one who reads a legal document, whether public or private,\nshould not be prompt to\nascribe –  should not without necessity or some\nsound reason, impute – to its language tautology or superfluity, and\nshould be rather at the outset inclined to suppose every word intended to have\nsome effect or be of some use.\n’ See also\nPortion 1 of 46 Wadeville\n(Pty) Ltd v Unity Cutlery (Pty) Ltd & others\n1984 (1) SA 61\n(A) at\n70C-D.\n[12]\nSee para\n9.\n[13]\nSee\nVan\nZyl\n’s case ( para 12 above) para 6 at\n445J-446B.\n[14]\nSee footnote 4\nabove.\n[15]\nSee\nFedgen\nInsurance Ltd v Leyds\n1995 (3) SA 33\n(SCA) at 38G-H.\n[16]\nJuglal NO & another\nv Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd t/a OK Franchise Division\n2004 (5) SA 248\n(SCA) para 12 at 258D-G, referring to\nSasfin (Pty) Ltd v Beukes\n1989 (1)\nSA 1\n(A) at 8C-9G.

    "facts": "In June 2001 the deceased, Jean Pierre van der Merwe, entered into a life insurance policy with Hollard Life Assurance that was intended to cover his liability to Wesbank under a motor vehicle credit agreement. The deceased subsequently ceded all his rights under the policy to Wesbank as security for the outstanding debt. A few weeks later the deceased accidentally discharged his own firearm, sustaining a fatal injury while still owing money to Wesbank. The executor of the deceased’s estate and Wesbank lodged a claim for the policy benefit. Hollard rejected the claim, relying on an exclusion clause covering \"suicide, self‑inflicted injury or self‑inflicted illness, whether intended or not\" and contending that the executor lacked standing because the policy rights had been ceded.",
    "issues": "1) Whether the exclusion clause in the policy excludes liability for an accidental, wholly self‑inflicted injury that was not intentional. 2) Whether the executor of the deceased’s estate had locus standi to enforce the claim notwithstanding the cession of the policy rights to Wesbank.",
    "principles": "The court applied established rules of contract interpretation, including the Fedgen v Leyds criteria, the contra proferentem rule, ejusdem generis, and the principle that insurance policies must be construed liberally in favour of the insured. It noted the insurer’s burden to prove an exclusion applies. Regarding cession, the court relied on the rule from National Bank v Cohen’s Trustee that an executor may enforce ceded rights as an asset of the insolvent estate, subject to the pledgee’s preferential claim.",
    "application": "Applying the interpretative rules, the court held that the exclusion clause presupposes a deliberate intent; the phrase \"whether intended or not\" qualified only \"self‑inflicted illness\" and not \"self‑inflicted injury\". Consequently, the accidental shooting did not fall within the exclusion. The court also affirmed that the executor could enforce the policy rights despite the cession, though Wesbank retained a preferential right to the proceeds. It further found the inclusion of \"whether intended or not\" in a general exclusion to be contrary to public policy, rendering that part of the clause unenforceable.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal allowed Hollard’s appeal, set aside the lower court’s judgment, and substituted an order dismissing the plaintiff’s (executor’s) claim for benefits under the policy. Costs were awarded in favour of Hollard."
