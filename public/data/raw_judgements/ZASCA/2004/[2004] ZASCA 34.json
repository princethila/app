Shortly after midday and in\nconsequence of certain information having been received by\nthem, six policemen\nin three vehicles descended on the home of one Nhlanhla David Nyembe\n(“\nthe deceased\n”) in Sobantu.\n[2]\tWhilst still at his\nhome, according to the arresting officer Sergeant Marian, the initial feigned\nignorance on the part of the\ndeceased and denial of any wrongdoing by him,\nquickly gave way once his rights had been explained to him to be replaced by a\nco-operative\nattitude. Aside from perspiring and appearing somewhat nervous the\ndeceased evidenced no visible injuries or signs of ill-health.\nCertain items\nfound at the deceased’s home pursuant to a search conducted with his\nconsent, as well as the deceased’s\nvehicle and his licensed firearm, all\nbelieved to be linked to the commission of the offences in Panorama Gardens,\nwere seized. \nThe deceased was arrested and taken into\ncustody.\n[3]\tEntrusting the deceased to the care of his relief commander,\nSergeant Marian proceeded to Captain Gafoor, the head of the CID,\nand\ncommunicated to him news of the deceased’s arrest. Returning to the charge\noffice, Sergeant Marian processed the deceased\nby causing appropriate entries to\nbe made in the SAP Register’s 13 and 14. An occurrence book entry at 13:25\nrecords that the\ndeceased had no visible injuries.  That much, was confirmed\nduring their evidence, by both Sergeant Marian and Inspector Ravindra\nMaharaj\nthe charge office commander.\n[4]\tSome five minutes later and prior to the\ndeceased being lodged in the cells Sergeant Marian handed the deceased to the\nthird appellant.\n Confirmation of that appears in an entry in the occurrence\nbook at 13:30, which reads: 'Suspect out: B/M David Nyembe 14/299/04/98.\n No\ninjuries. Taken by: Signed: Y Pillay.'\n[5]\tAt 14:30, the occurrence book\nrecords:  'Report: Sergeant Y Pillay reports that the suspect B/M David Nyembe\nSAP 14/299/04/98\nwas booked out on further investigation by Sergeant Y Pillay.\nThe suspect was taken to Sergeant Ryan’s office.  En route to\nthe office\nthe suspect complained of dizziness and short breath. The ambulance was summoned\nto attend to the suspect. Ambulance attendant\nJohan Prinsloo of MRI attended and\ncertified that the suspect was deceased. Cause of death is unknown at this\nstage, the suspect\ndid however bring up a lot of food through his nose and\nmouth. At no stage was the suspect assaulted whilst in my custody.  Entry\nfor\nstation commissioner’s attention.  Signed Y Pillay.'\n[6]\tThose\nundisputed facts formed the basis of the charge levelled by the state against\neach of the appellants in the trial court.\nThe appellants pleaded not guilty but\nwere each convicted as charged by the Regional Court, Pietermaritzburg on one\ncount of culpable\nhomicide and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 years.\nAn appeal to the Natal Provincial Division (Jappie et Moleko JJ) met\nwith\npartial success inasmuch as the sentence in each instance was reduced to a term\nof imprisonment for a period of 7 years.  The\nappellants sought and were granted\nleave, by the court\na quo\n, to appeal to this Court against in each\ninstance the conviction as well as the sentence imposed pursuant\nthereto.\n[7]\tLogically, the only evidence as to what transpired in the office\nof the second appellant emanated from the appellants. The appellants,\nall of\nwhom testified in their defence told a similar story. After having left the\ncharge office with the deceased the third appellant\nproceeded to the office of\nthe second appellant, which was then occupied by the second and fourth\nappellants. Although not a member\nof the Murder and Robbery Unit like the other\nthree, the assistance of the first appellant was also enlisted to interrogate\nthe deceased.\nDuring the course of the questioning the deceased appeared to move\nsomewhat uneasily in his chair. He began perspiring heavily and\ncoughed\nintermittently. As the coughing became more frequent and the perspiring more\nprofuse concern for his well-being grew. The\nthird appellant enquired whether\nthe deceased was unwell or under medication. The deceased requested some water\nwhich was brought\nto him in a discarded Coke can by the second appellant. The\nthird appellant removed the deceased’s handcuffs to enable him\nto drink\nthe water. When he complained that he was feeling hot and stood up and\nunbuttoned his shirt, the fourth appellant moved\na fan closer to him. The\ndeceased kicked off his takkies. His quickly deteriorating condition prompted\nthe third appellant to contact\nthe Provincial Ambulance Services. As the\ncoughing worsened the deceased appeared to be choking and had difficulty\nswallowing. Food\nparticles emitted from his mouth as he struggled to breathe.\nThe deceased then slid off the chair and fell to the ground knocking\nhis head on\nthe floor in the process.  Whilst the third appellant contacted a second\nambulance service, the first appellant employed\nCPR and mouth-to-mouth\nresuscitation in an endeavour to revive the deceased. When the paramedics from\nthe second ambulance service\neventually arrived the deceased was pronounced\ndead.\n[8]\tThree forensic pathologists testified during the trial. All three\nappeared to be in agreement that the cause of death was blunt\nforce trauma to\nthe head, with resultant intra-cranial pathology resulting in suppressed levels\nof consciousness. A bout of vomiting\nfollowed and in his concussed state the\ndeceased inhaled his own vomitus and asphyxiated. Support for that conclusion is\nto be found\nin the histology report of Prof Dada (exhibit “L”) whose\nexamination of sections of the deceased’s lungs revealed\ncongestion as\nwell as large quantities of foreign organic (mainly vegetable) matter in the\nbronchi and alveolar spaces.\n[9]\tDrs Maney and Perumal who jointly\nconducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased observed that the deceased\nhad suffered\n'...extensive bruising of the skin and subcutaneous tissue over the\nwhole body.' Those injuries were consistent, in the opinion of\nDr Maney, with a\nsustained beating.\n[10]\tBy a process of inferential reasoning, direct\nevidence being absent, the trial court concluded that each of the appellants\n'...\nwhose evidence was so improbable as not to be a reasonable possibility'\nwere indeed guilty. Both the conclusion reached as well as\nthe reasoning by the\ntrial court are under attack in this Court.\n[11]\tThe thrust of the\nappellants’ case in this court is that the deceased must have sustained\nhis injuries in consequence of\nan assault which had been perpetrated upon him by\nmembers of the Police Service at some stage prior to him being entrusted into\nthe\nthird appellant’s custody. Support for such a hypothesis, which it was\nsubmitted is a tenable one, is to be found in the evidence\nof the state witness\nSipho Mhlongo.\n[12]\tThe evidence of Mhlongo, or rather such of it as can\nproperly be discerned, in a nutshell, is, that he was in the company of\nothers\nincluding John Mchunu, when he chanced  upon an assault being perpetrated by\nbetween two and four policemen on a male person,\nwho it must immediately be said\ncould only have been the deceased. He then made a report to one Sgt. Ngubane,\nwho, according to him,\nwas prepared to come to the assistance of civilians who\nwere ill-treated at the police station.\n[13]\tThe magistrate found Mhlongo to\nbe an unreliable witness and without more disregarded his evidence in toto. The\nconclusion by\nthe magistrate that Mhlongo was an unreliable witness is\nundoubtedly correct. That much is supported by the evidence on the record.\nWhat\nwas impermissible, so it was argued on behalf of the appellants, was for the\nmagistrate to have simply disregarded his evidence\nin its entirety as if he had\nnever testified. Counsel’s stricture is sound. For, the factual hypothesis\nthat the deceased may\nhave been assaulted earlier raises starkly the question as\nto whether the appellants could properly have been convicted.\n[14]\tIt seems\nclear that the trial court did not fully appreciate the factual problems that\nMhlongo’s evidence presents, nor\nthe complex legal difficulties that it\nraises. The cardinal issue on appeal therefore is whether Mhlongo’s\nevidence that he\nwitnessed an assault in the passage has sufficient cogency to\ngive rise to a reasonable possibility that it could be true. If so,\nthe\nappellants are entitled to the benefit thereof.\n[15]\tIn order to determine\nwhat I have described as the cardinal issue it is necessary to consider the\nevidence of Mhlongo in some\ndetail and to weigh his claim that he witnessed an\nassault in the passage against the evidence of Mchunu and Ngubane, as also\nagainst\nthe remainder of the factual matrix and the inherent probabilities in\nthe case.\n[16]\t Mhlongo’s tale grew in the telling. As his evidence\nunfolded, the nature and severity of the assaults became more exaggerated\nand\nthe number of assailants increased. Not only did his evidence suffer a myriad of\ninternal contradictions, but it conflicted in\nmaterial respects with that of\nMchunu and Ngubane. Mhlongo’s evidence that he was in the company of\nMchunu when the assaults\nwere witnessed finds no support in the evidence of the\nlatter. Mchunu testified that he was seated on a bench outside the building\nin\nconversation with an insurance consultant when he heard screams emanate from the\nfirst floor. After the screaming had died down\nand there was silence, according\nto Mchunu, Mhlongo came to him and informed him that a person was being\nassaulted in the charge\noffice. Interestingly, in his statement to the police,\nwhich I must at once record he deviated from during his evidence, Mchunu stated:\n‘. . .[Sipho Mhlongo] came to me outside the charge office and\ninformed me that there was a black male that was assaulted by\nthe SAPS members\non the first floor. I asked him whether he heard or saw when and who was\nassaulting that person or when that person\nwas assaulted, he replied that he\nonly heard when that person was screaming / crying on the first\nfloor.’\n[17]\tSgt. Ngubane testified that although he did not hear\nthe screaming himself he was approached by Mhlongo whilst he was busy washing\nhis vehicle, who reported to him that somebody was screaming upstairs in the\ndetective’s office. That somebody was allegedly\nscreaming upstairs,\nimpacts in a direct and substantial way on Mhlongo’s evidence that an\nassault had been perpetrated in the\npassage downstairs.\n[18]\tMhlongo\ntestified that during the assault witnessed by him the victim was inter alia\nkicked in the face and was bleeding from\nhis ears and nose. Such obvious signs\nof apparent ill–treatment could not have passed unnoticed. And yet, the\narresting officer,\nthe charge office commander, as well as all of the appellants\nobserved nothing untoward. Indeed, each of the appellants testified\nthat they\nwould not have commenced with the interrogation of the deceased if it appeared\nto them that he was injured or unwell.\n[19]\tBoth Drs Maney and Perumal\nrecorded in their medico-legal post-mortem reports (exhibits “B” and\n“C” respectively)\nas one of their chief post-mortem findings:\n'Bruising of the anterior abdominal wall with perforation of the intestine and\nbruising\nof the mesentery.' On the strength of the photographs of the\ndeceased’s body, he not having been present during the post-mortem\nexamination, Dr Naidoo opined that the perforation of the intestine had occurred\npost-mortem during the dissection of the deceased’s\nbody.\n[20]\tDr\nPerumal referred to various aspects, in particular the surrounding bruising in\nthe abdominal area and the fact that the intestinal\ninjury was a 15 mm diameter\ntear and not a clean linear cut, which fortified his view that the injury was in\nconsequence of blunt\nabdominal trauma inflicted ante-mortem. On this aspect, the\ntrial court preferred, quite correctly in my view, the evidence of Dr\nPerumal.\nDr Perumal described the abdominal injury as a severe injury caused by the\napplication of significant force. The clinical\nsymptoms of such an injury,\naccording to Dr Perumal, is that the deceased would have been ' ... bending over\nand keeling over and\nhe probably would have vomited'.\n[21]\tIf the underlying\nhypothesis of the appellants' version, relying as it does upon the evidence of\nMhlongo, is to be accepted,\nthen the charge office commander or the appellants\nthemselves ought to have noticed the evident physical distress of the deceased.\nNone of them did. Sgt Marian testified that when he handed the deceased over to\nthe third appellant in the charge office the deceased\nwas free of any injuries.\nIndeed, the occurrence book entry to which the third appellant appended his\nsignature affords corroboration\nof that fact.\n[22]\tNot only did the deceased\nwalk unaided, which would have been improbable on Dr Perumal’s evidence,\nbut he on the appellants’\nown version, was alert and furnished a coherent\naccount during the interrogation. No motive suggests itself on the evidence as\nto\nwhy others who were not involved in the investigation, would want to assault\nthe deceased. Much less, for them to immediately thereafter,\nturn him over to\nthe appellants for interrogation.\n[23]\tMhlongo puts the assault in the\npassage in close proximity to the charge office. The notion that the deceased\ncould have been\nsubjected to a sustained beating in one of those highly visible\npublic areas prior to his being removed to the office of the second\nappellant,\nis, in my view, far-fetched.  The risk to a police officer who chooses to\nconduct himself/herself in such a fashion is\nobvious. A member of the public or\na disapproving colleague could easily chance upon such unlawful conduct.\n[24]\tThe deceased evidently made no complaint to the charge office commander\nor the appellants, who according to them, were treating\nhim humanely, of any\nassaults having been perpetrated upon him from the time of his arrest until he\ncame into contact with them.\nAcceptance of Mhlongo’s evidence, entails by\nimplication acceptance of a wholly untenable proposition, namely that various\nmembers of the Mountain Rise Police Station conspired to shield the real\nperpetrators at the expense of the appellants.\n[25]\tIn S\nv Hadebe and\nOthers\n1998 (1) SACR 422\n(SCA) at 426 e-h, this court citing with approval\nfrom\nMoshephi and Others v R\n(1980-1984) LAC 57\nat 59F-H\nheld:\n‘The breaking down of a body of evidence into its component parts\nis obviously a useful aid to a proper understanding and evaluation\nof it.  But,\nin doing so, one must guard against a tendency to focus too intently upon the\nseparate and individual part of what is,\nafter all, a mosaic of proof.  Doubts\nabout one aspect of the evidence led in a trial may arise when that aspect is\nviewed in isolation.\nThose doubts may be set at rest when it is evaluated again\ntogether with all the other available evidence.  That is not to say that\na broad\nand indulgent approach is appropriate when evaluating evidence.  Far from it. \nThere is no substitute for a detailed and\ncritical examination of each and every\ncomponent in a body of evidence.  But, once that has been done, it is necessary\nto step back\na pace and consider the mosaic as a whole.  If that is not done,\none may fail to see the wood for the trees.'\n[26]\tThe mosaic as a whole\nlends little to the factual foundation upon which the logical deduction must\nrest for the proposition that\nthe deceased had in fact been assaulted in the\npassage downstairs. When viewed against the tapestry of all of the evidence, the\nclaim\nby Mhlongo that he witnessed an assault is untenable, and accordingly must\nbe rejected as false.\n[27]\tThe rejection by the trial court of the defence\nversion as false, cannot be faulted. The trial court concluded, quite correctly,\nthat the deceased had sustained his injuries in the office of the second\nappellant whilst in the custody of all four of the appellants.\nThe only\nexplanation tendered by the appellants as to how the deceased could possibly\nhave sustained those injuries is that he slid\noff his chair and fell to the\nground striking his head in that process. That single occurrence, however,\ncannot explain, in addition\nto the other injuries already alluded to, the:\n'(i) \t\"five areas on the scalp that indicate bruising and therefore a point of\nimpact\";\n(ii) \t\"four parts of the rib cage showed that there was blunt force\";\n(iii) \t\"focal bruising of the right and left lungs anteriorly and\nposteriorly\";\n(iv) \t\"bruising relating to the left psoas muscle and bruising relating to the\nrectum\"; and\n(v) \t\"bruising of the subcutaneous tissue of the left and right thigh\nposteriorly.\"'\nas testified to by Dr Perumal. Dr Naidoo, the\nexpert witness called on behalf of the appellants conceded that all of the\ninjuries\nsuffered by the deceased could not be explained by a single\noccurrence.\n[28]\tIt was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the\nevidence does not exclude the possibility that one or more of the appellants\nmay\nnot have participated in the attack on the deceased. That matters not in my\nview. There was in law a duty, in the circumstances\nof this case, on those\npolicemen who were present and who witnessed (as indeed each must have) but did\nnot participate in the attack\non the deceased to put a stop to it.  Each of the\nappellants could have been convicted on any one of three bases. Firstly, that he\nparticipated in the fatal assault in circumstances where he ought reasonably to\nhave foreseen the resultant death. Secondly, that\nhe had associated himself with\nthe fatal attack although not himself participating therein (that is, on the\nbasis of common purpose).\nAnd, thirdly, he omitted to prevent the assault and\nconsequent death in circumstances where there was a duty on him to do so (see\nS v Barnes\nand another\n1990 (2) SACR 485\n(N) at 490 i-j).\n[29]\tFinally, it was submitted, although somewhat obliquely, that the\nconviction was ill - founded inasmuch as the requisite mens\nrea had not been\nproved. That attack on the conviction is misconceived as it misconstrues the\ntrue nature of the enquiry in regard\nto an essential element of the offence. In\nS v Naidoo and Others\n2003 (1) SACR 347\n(SCA) at 357, Marais JA stated,\nif I may say so, with characteristic lucidity:\n‘The crime of culpable homicide, on the other hand (certainly as\nregards the consequence (death) of the impugned act or omission)\npostulates an\nabsence of\ndolus\nand the presence of\nculpa\n.  The fact that the\ncrime of culpable homicide may be committed even where the act which causes\ndeath is an intentional act of assault\nshould not be allowed to obscure that\nessential truth.  In such a case the perpetrator is not convicted of culpable\nhomicide simply\nbecause he or she deliberately assaulted a person as a\nconsequence of which it so happened that the person died.  If the perpetrator\ncould not reasonably have foreseen that death might ensue, a conviction of\nculpable homicide cannot be justified.\nAliter\nif death should have been\nforeseen as a possible consequence.  What this shows is that it is the\nperpetrator's culpable failure to\nforesee the possibility of death in cases\nwhere an assault has resulted in death and, in cases not involving an assault,\nthat failure\ncoupled with a further culpable failure, namely a failure to do\nwhat could and should have been done to prevent the occurrence of\ndeath, that is\nthe rationale for the conviction of culpable homicide.\nCulpa\nis\ntherefore always present in the crime of culpable homicide.  Sometimes it is\nalso associated with\ndolus\n(as in intentional assaults resulting in\nreasonably foreseeable but actually unforeseen death).  Sometimes it is not (as\nin negligent\nconduct resulting in reasonably foreseeable death).  For a\npenetrating and instructive analysis of these matters see Professor Roger\nWhiting's article \"Negligence, Fault and Criminal Liability\" in\n(1991) 108\nSALJ\n431.'\nOn a simple application of those principles to the facts here present, it is\npatent that each of the appellants was correctly convicted.\nGiven the sustained\nnature of the attack, each of them ought reasonably to have foreseen the death\nof the deceased.\n[30]\tAs to sentence. It is trite that this court will not interfere with\nthe sentence imposed by the court a quo unless it is satisfied\nthat the sentence\nhas been vitiated by a material misdirection or is disturbingly inappropriate.\nNo misdirection has been alluded\nto, nor can it be said that the sentence\ninduces a sense of shock.\n[31] It has been submitted on behalf of the\nappellants that the sentence is out of proportion to the gravity of the offence\nand that\nhaving regard to the personal circumstances of each of the appellants a\nportion of the sentence imposed by the court a quo should\nhave been suspended.\nIt is true that each of the appellants has an unblemished record and that each\nwas a useful member of society\nin gainful employment at the relevant time. Those\ncircumstances, however, have to be weighed against the nature and severity of\nthe\noffence and the requirements of society. Notwithstanding the clear\nmitigating factors present, the seriousness of the offence makes\nit necessary to\nsend out a clear message that the resort by policemen to violence of the kind\nencountered in this case cannot be\ncountenanced.\n[32] The natural\nindignation that the community would feel at conduct of this kind warrants\nrecognition in the determination of an\nappropriate sentence. It bears noting\nthat the version of the appellants was not only false but plainly contrived. In\nadvancing a\ncontrived version each placed fealty to his colleagues above his\nduties as a police officer (see S v Phallo and Others\n1999 (2) SACR 558\n(SCA) at\n570 a-b). There appears to me to be no warrant for interfering with the sentence\nimposed by the court\na quo\n.  It follows, in my view, that the appeal in\nrespect of sentence must also fail.\n[33]\tIn the result the appeal is\ndismissed.\n_________________________\nPONNAN  AJA\nCONCURRING:\nMARAIS JA\nMTHIYANE JA",

    "facts": "In April 1998 the police received a report of a robbery and rape and arrested B/M David Nyembe. He was taken to Mountain Rise Police Station, processed, and handed over to the third appellant. While in the custody of the second appellant’s office the suspect complained of dizziness, became severely perspiring, coughed, vomited and eventually collapsed, striking his head. He was declared dead after two ambulance services attended. Three forensic pathologists testified that death resulted from blunt‑force trauma to the head and subsequent asphyxiation of vomitus, with multiple bruises inconsistent with a single fall. The State charged the four appellants with culpable homicide; they were convicted and sentenced to twelve years, reduced on appeal to seven years. The appellants appealed both the conviction and the sentence.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the evidence, particularly that of state witness Sipho Mhlongo, raised a reasonable possibility that the deceased had been assaulted prior to being placed in the second appellant’s custody. 2. Whether the appellants can be held liable for culpable homicide on the basis of participation, common purpose or omission to prevent an assault. 3. Whether the conviction was unsafe owing to the alleged earlier assault. 4. Whether the sentence was excessive or improperly imposed.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the law on culpable homicide, emphasizing that the offence requires an unlawful act or omission (culpa) without dolus, and that liability may arise from participation, common purpose, or a legal duty to intervene. Precedent cited includes S v Barnes (duty to prevent assault), S v Hadebe (evaluation of mosaic evidence), Moshephi and Others (holistic assessment of evidence), and S v Naidoo (requirements of foresight of death in culpable homicide). The Court reiterated that a police officer who witnesses an assault has a duty to stop it, and failure may constitute liability under common‑purpose or omission doctrines.",
    "application": "The Court found Mhlongo’s testimony unreliable and contradictory, concluding it did not raise a reasonable possibility of a prior assault. The forensic evidence demonstrated that the injuries could not be explained by a single fall, indicating a sustained beating in the second appellant’s office. Given the presence of all four appellants, their knowledge of the suspect’s condition and the duty imposed on police officers, the Court held that each could be convicted on one of the three bases (participation, common purpose, omission). The Court rejected the appellants’ contention that the conviction lacked the requisite mens rea, noting that the severity of the assault made death reasonably foreseeable. Consequently, the convictions were upheld and the sentence of seven years affirmed as appropriate.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The convictions for culpable homicide were affirmed and the sentences of seven years’ imprisonment upheld. No alteration to the sentence was made."
