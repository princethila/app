The appellant contended that it is considered in law\nto\nhave made the payments, that it had no power to make such payments,\nthat the payments had in any event not been authorised and\nthat each\nof the respondents was unjustly enriched by the payment received by\nhim. The court\na quo\ndismissed the action and with its leave\nthe appellant now appeals against such dismissal.\n[2]\tThe appellant was established in terms of s 2 of the\nAgricultural Research Council Act 86 of 1990 (âthe Actâ). The\nFund\nis a pension fund established by the appellant under the\nPension\nFunds Act 24 of 1956\nin terms of the provisions of s 19(1)(g) of\nthe Act.\n[3]\tAfter the appellant had been established 12 research institutes\nwere transferred to it from the Department of Agriculture. Most\nof\nthe employees of those institutes, including the respondents were, by\nagreement, transferred to the appellant. As employees of\nthe\nappellant the respondents became members of the Fund.\n[4]\tDuring 1997 and 1998 the respondentsâ membership of the Fund\nwas terminated. In the case of the first and second respondents\nthe\ntermination occurred in terms of rule 4.3(3) of the rules of the Fund\nand in the case of the third and fourth respondents it\noccurred in\nterms of rule 4.7. Each of the respondents exercised the option\nprovided for in rule 7.4, which rule reads as follows:\nâ\nIf a Memberâs membership of the Fund is terminated\nin terms of Rules 4.1 to 4.4, 4.7, 5.1 to 5.4, 5.7 or 6.2(2), he may\nrequest\nthe Board, before his Pension benefit becomes payable, rather\nto treat his Pension benefit as follows:\nPay the Member a Gratuity equal to a maximum of one\n\tthird of the value of his Pension benefit in terms of the Rules,\n\twhich value\nthe Board shall determine in consultation with the\n\tActuary; in which case the balance of the Memberâs Pension benefit\n\tshall be\ntransferred to an Insurer or an Approved Retirement Fund,\n\texcluding such Provident Fund, for the purchase of a pension with\n\tthat\nInsurer or Approved Retirement Fund. Once such transfer is\n\tcomplete, the Fund shall have no further obligation in respect of\n\tthe\nMember.\nTransfer the full value of the Memberâs Pension\n\tbenefit in (1) above, in which case the conditions of (1) shall\n\tapply mutatis\nmutandis.\nApply the memberâs Gratuity to secure for the Member\n\tan additional Pension from the Fund. In such a case the Board, in\n\tconsultation\nwith the Actuary, shall determine the amount and the\n\tconditions of payment.â\n[5]\tRule 7.17 provides for an increase of gratuities payable in terms\nof rules 4.1 to 4.7 and 5.1 to 5.7 to compensate for income\ntax\npayable on such gratuities. The basis for the increase and the degree\nto which a member is compensated is to be agreed between\nthe member\nand the employer. The rule reads as follows:\nâ\n(1)\tNotwithstanding any other conditions of the\nRules, the Board shall deduct from the Beneficiaryâs Pension\nbenefit any amount\nfrom such benefit due in terms of the Income Tax\nAct, before the benefit is paid to the Beneficiary.\nThe Employer increases a Gratuity payable to an\n\tA-member or his Beneficiary (as the case may be) and to a B-member\n\tor his Beneficiary\n(as the case may be) to compensate for any income\n\ttax payable by such Member or Beneficiary in terms of Annexure 2 to\n\tthe Income\nTax Act, in respect of a Gratuity in terms of Rules 4.1\n\tto 4.7 and 5.1 to 5.7 respectively.\nThe basis for the increase of the Gratuity in terms of\n\t(2) above, and the degree to which a Member or his Beneficiary is\n\tcompensated\nis agreed upon by the Member and the Employer. Such\n\tcompensation is however only payable for as long as, and to the\n\tdegree that\ncorresponding Gratuity benefits payable to a member of a\n\tPrevious State Fund are exempt of the provisions of Annexure 2 of\n\tthe\nIncome Tax Act.â\n[6]\tOn 20 November 1992 the Executive Management Committee of the\nappellant (âthe EMCâ) accepted a âHoofbestuursmemorandumâ\nto\nthe effect that no increase in a gratuity was payable to any member\nwhose membership had been terminated in terms of rules 4.1-4.4,\n4.7,\n5.1-5.4, 5.7 or 6.2(2) and who exercised the option provided for in\nrule 7.4.\n[7]\tA member who exercised the option provided for in rule 7.4 is\nentitled to a gratuity in terms of that rule and not to a gratuity\npayable in terms of rules 4.1 to 4.7 or 5.1 to 5.7. But, only\ngratuities payable in terms of rules 4.1 to 4.7 or 5.1 to 5.7 are to\nbe increased in terms of rule 7.17. It follows that insofar as rule\n7.17 is concerned the memorandum merely confirmed what was stated\nin\nthat rule.\n[8]\tOn 23 May 1997 the EMC took the following decision (âthe\ndecision of 23 May 1997):\nâ\n1\tDie LNR\n1\ndie gratifikasievoordeel bedoel in reÃ«l 7.17(2) saamgelees met reÃ«l\n7.4 van die Reglement van die LNRPF\n2\nsal verhoog om te vergoed vir enige inkomstebelasting wat op die\nvolle gratifikasievoordeel of gedeelte daarvan volgens die keuse\nvan\ndie lid betaalbaar mag wees.\n2.\tSodanige vergoeding slegs betaalbaar sal wees vir\nsolank as wat die gratifikasievoordele in die staat nie belasbaar is\nnie.\n3.\tDie maatreÃ«l met ingang van 1 Junie 1997 van\ntoepassing is op alle uitbetalings van gratifikasievoordele vanaf 1\nJunie 1997 ongeag\ndie datum van uitdienstrede.â\n[9]\tThe EMC is a committee established in terms of s 16 of the\nAct, which, subject to the directives and control of the appellant,\nis responsible for the management of the affairs of the appellant in\naccordance with the objects and policy of the appellant. During\n1997\nwhen the EMC made the decision the fourth appellant was the president\nand the other respondents were members of the EMC.\n[10]\tIn the case of the first respondent the gratuity payable in\nterms of rule 7.4 amounted to R962 067,17. The appellant paid\nan\namount of R530 961,93 to the fund in order to increase the\ngratuity to an amount which would after deduction of the income\ntax\npayable by the fund in respect of the gratuity equal the amount of\nR962 067,17. In a letter by the Fund to the appellant\npreceding\nthe payment the Fund requested payment thereof on the basis that in\nterms of rule 7.17 the amount was payable (verskuldig)\nby the\nappellant to the Fund. In the event the Fund only paid R456 441,17\nincome tax in respect of the gratuity. It paid R1 036 307,18\nbeing the gratuity of R962 067,17 plus the difference between\nR530 961,93 and R456 441,17 (R74 520,76) less arrear\ntaxes in an amount of R280,75 to the first respondent.\n[11]\tIn the case of the second respondent the gratuity payable in\nterms of rule 7.4 amounted to R763 068,40. The appellant paid\nan\namount of R422 221,95 to the Fund in order to increase the\ngratuity to an amount that would after deduction of the income\ntax\npayable by the Fund in respect of the gratuity equal the amount of\nR763 068,40. As in the case of the first respondent the\npayment\nwas preceded by a letter by the Fund to the appellant in which the\nFund requested payment thereof on the basis that in terms\nof rule\n7.17 the amount was payable by the appellant to the Fund. In the\nevent the Fund only paid R349 044,17 income tax in\nrespect of\nthe gratuity. The Fund paid the total gratuity of R763 177,78\nplus the difference between R422 221,95 and R349 044,77\nbeing R73 177,78 to the second respondent.\n[12]\tIn the case of the third respondent the gratuity payable in\nterms of rule 7.4 amounted to R614 275,90. The appellant paid\nan\namount of R265 635,55 to the Fund in order to increase the\ngratuity to an amount that would after deduction of the income\ntax\npayable by the fund in respect of the gratuity equal the amount of\nR614 275,90. Again, the payment was preceded by a letter\nby the\nFund to the appellant in which the fund requested payment thereof on\nthe basis that, in terms of rule 7.17, the amount was\npayable by the\nappellant to the Fund. In the event the Fund paid R267 582,80\nincome tax in respect of the gratuity. The difference\nbetween\nR265 635,55 and R267 582,80 being R1 947,25\nconstituted an overpayment by the fund to the South African Revenue\nService (âSARSâ). The Fund paid a sum of R621 338,52 being\nthe total gratuity of R614 275,90 plus interest to the third\nrespondent.\n[13]\tIn the case of the fourth respondent the gratuity payable in\nterms of rule 7.4 amounted to R1 638 820,91. The appellant\npaid an amount of R1 189 898,25 to the Fund in order to\nincrease the gratuity to an amount that would after deduction of\nthe\nincome tax payable by the Fund in respect of the gratuity equal the\namount of R1 638 820,91. Once again the payment\nwas\npreceded by a letter by the Fund to the appellant in which the Fund\nrequested payment thereof on the basis that, in terms of\nrule 7.17,\nthe amount was payable by the appellant to the Fund. The Fund paid\nthe amount of R1 189 898,20 to SARS and the\ntotal gratuity\nof R1 638 820,91 to the fourth respondent.\n[14]\tThe appellant submitted that in law the payments of the amounts\nof R530 961,93, R422 221,95, R265 635,55 and\nR1 189 898,25 by the appellant to the Fund constituted\npayments to the respondents and that the Fund was merely used as\na\nconvenient conduit. It was submitted, furthermore, that the appellant\ndid not have the power to make such payments and that even\nif it had\nthe power it had not delegated authority to the EMC to take the\ndecision of 23 May 1997. On that basis, relying on the\ncondictio\nindebiti\nalternatively the\ncondictio sine causa\n, the\nappellant claimed repayment by the respondents of the amounts paid to\nthe Fund and in turn paid by the Fund to them. The respondents\ncontended that the payments were made to the Fund and not to them.\nThey were made, so the argument went, in order to enable the Fund\nto\npay an increased gratuity to each of the respondents. They contended\nin the alternative that the payments were\nintra vires\nand\nproperly authorised.\n[15]\tThe court\na quo\nheld that the appellant had the power to\nmake the payments and that it had lawfully delegated that power to\nthe EMC. Having arrived\nat this conclusion the court\na quo\ndid\nnot consider it necessary to deal with the other arguments raised by\nthe parties.\n[16]\tAs the parties did in argument before us I shall deal with the\nissue of whether the payments by the appellant to the Fund are\nin law\nconsidered to be payments by the appellant to the respondents. If\nthey were not, any claim the appellant might have is against\nthe Fund\nand not against the respondents. For purposes of this argument I\nshall assume that the payments had not been duly authorised\nand that\nthey were therefore\nindebite\n.\n[17]\tEach of the payments was made in response to a statement by the\nFund that the amount was payable (âverskuldigâ) in terms\nof rule\n7.17 and a request that payment be effected to the Fund as soon as\npossible. It is, therefore, in the absence of any evidence\nto the\ncontrary, probable that the appellant intended to make the payments\nand the Fund intended to receive the payments in terms\nof rule 7.17.\n[18]\tRule 7.17 provides that the employer is liable to increase the\ngratuities payable to certain employees. The extent of that liability\nis to be determined by agreement between the employee and the\nemployer but once agreed is a liability in terms of the rules of the\nFund. The Fund is registered as a pension fund in accordance with the\nprovisions of\ns 4\nof the\nPension Funds Act (Act\n24 of 1956).\nSection 13A(1)\nof that Act provides that the employer of any member\nof a fund registered in terms of s 4 shall pay to the fund in full\nâany contribution\nwhich, in terms of the rules of the fund, is to\nbe deducted from the memberâs remuneration and any contribution for\nwhich the employer\nis liable in terms of those rulesâ.\n[19]\tThe employerâs liability to increase the gratuity is therefore\na liability to pay the amount required to increase the gratuity\nto\nthe Fund. It follows that it is probable that the appellant intended\nto make the payments and the Fund intended to receive the\npayments in\ndischarge of the appellantâs statutory liability to make the\npayments to the Fund. That is so even though the liability\nto pay the\nFund is a liability towards the employee.\n[20]\tCounsel for the appellant relied on the fact that it is common\ncause between the parties that payment by the appellant in terms\nof\nrule 7.17 amounts to the payment of a remuneration, alternatively an\nallowance, alternatively a subsidy, alternatively a benefit\nto the\nemployee concerned. They submitted that it followed that the payments\nwere made in order to discharge perceived obligations\nowed by the\nappellant to the respondents. Therefore, so the argument went, the\npayments to the Fund constituted payments to the respondents.\n[21]\tI accept that when A is liable to B to pay an amount to C (as\nsolutionis causa adjectus\n3\n),\npayment by A to C in discharge of his obligation to B is considered\nto be a payment by A to B. It does, however not follow that\nif A in\nhis own name make payment to C erroneously believing that he owes B\nan obligation to do so, that such payment would be considered\nto be a\npayment by A to B.\n[22]\tI also accept the correctness of the decisions in\nLicences\nand General Insurance Co v Ismay\n1951 (2) SA 456\n(EDL) at 462B;\nand\nVorster v Marine & Trade Versekeringsmaatskappy Bpk\n1968 (1) SA 130\n(O) at 132H-132G to the effect that where A, at the\nrequest or order of B and on his behalf, paid an amount to C\nerroneously believing\nthat he was indebted to B in that amount, such\npayment is considered to be a payment by A to B.\n[23]\tIn the present case the position is quite different:\nI assumed in favour of the appellant that the payments had not been\n\tduly authorised. The appellant, therefore, did not owe the\n\trespondents an obligation to pay the amounts to the Fund;\nThe appellant paid the amounts erroneously believing that it was\n\tobliged to do so and not at the request or order of the respondents;\nThe appellant paid the amounts in its own name and not on behalf of\n\tthe respondents;\nThe appellant paid the amounts to the Fund in order to enable the\n\tFund to pay increased gratuities to the respondents.\nIn these circumstances there is in my view no basis for considering\nthe payments by the appellant to be payments by the appellant\nto the\nrespondents. None of the authorities referred to by the appellant\nsupported the appellantâs contention to the contrary and\nI am not\naware of any authority to that effect.\n[24]\tIt was not contended that there was, in the event of it being\nheld that the payments were in law not to be considered to be\npayments by the appellant to the Fund, another basis on which the\nappellant could succeed. I do, therefore, not consider it necessary\nto deal with the other arguments raised by the appellant. If follows\nthat the appeal should be dismissed.\n[25]\tThe appeal is dismissed with costs including the costs of two\ncounsel.\n______\n____________\nP E STREICHER\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nERASMUS AJA)\tCONCUR\nNAVSA and HEHER JJA\n:\n[26]\nWe have read the judgment of Streicher JA. For the\nreasons which follow we are unable to agree with his conclusion that\nthe payments\nby the appellant were not to the respondents but to the\nfund.\n[27]\nIn the second part of this judgment we will deal with\nthat question and the issues identified by Streicher J and the bases\nof the\nconclusions reached by him. For the sake of convenience and\nbecause we consider it appropriate we intend to deal first with the\nquestion\nof whether the payments were properly authorised. We proceed\nto deal with that question.\n[28]\nIn terms of s 8 of the Act the affairs of the appellant\nare managed by a council (the Council) which determines policy and\nobjectives\nand exercises control over the performance of its\nfunctions and the execution of its duties. In terms of s 16 of the\nAct the appellant\nis obliged to appoint an executive management\ncommittee (in the present case the EMC) which is responsible for the\nmanagement of\nits affairs in accordance with its objects and policy.\nThat committee does not\nipso facto\nor\nipso jure\nhave\npower to make the determination which the appellant is empowered by s\n19(1)(b) to make.\n[29]\nThe appellantâs case was that the decision to increase\nthe gratuity, taken on the 23 May 1997 by the EMC, was unauthorised.\nAfter\nhearing evidence the court below held that the EMC, in deciding\nto increase the gratuity in question, had acted on authority properly\ndelegated to it by the appellant. A consideration of the evidence\nleads us to disagree with this finding for the reasons which follow.\n[30]\nThe fourth respondent, Dr Johannes Hendrik Terblanche\n(Terblanche), was the only witness to testify. He and the other\nrespondents\nwere all members of the EMC. He accepted that the\nappellant was responsible for setting policy and the EMC was\nresponsible for its\nexecution and implementation. The court below\naccepted his evidence that there was a general delegation to the EMC\nby the Council\nand that at his behest it was expanded over time. The\ncourt concluded that nobody was better qualified than the fourth\nrespondent\nto testify about the level of co-operation between the\nappellant and the EMC â he had been president of the appellant and\na member\nof the EMC.\n[31]\nThe court below found support for the fourth respondentâs\nevidence, that the EMC had acted on delegated authority in the fact\nthat\nthe Council received his annual report, in which there was\nreference to the increased gratuity, with acclamation and applause.\n(We\nshould note, in this regard, that not only was ratification not\npleaded by the respondents but reliance on it was expressly disavowed\nby their counsel.)\n[32]\nThe court below did not find it troubling that no minute\nof a resolution relating to the claimed delegation was forthcoming.\nThe learned\njudge recorded that it was common cause that not all of\nthe appellantâs resolutions were presented to him.\n[33]\nHowever, towards the end of his evidence in-chief, the\nfourth respondent was asked pertinently about how the Council\ndelegated authority\nto the EMC. His response was vague and evasive.\nUnder cross-examination he was asked how the delegation took place.\nHe responded\nby saying that it did not take place as a result of âân\nraadsbesluit as sodanig nie, maar ân voorlegging wat ek aan die\nraad\ngemaak het en dit is om die fine tuning te doen ten opsigte van\nhierdie delegasiesâ. But the documentation presented to the Council\nby the fourth respondent did not support his evidence that a\ndelegation took place. The transparencies he used during his\npresentation\nmerely showed how the appellant functioned; that it was\nthe Councilâs function to determine remuneration, subsidies and\nother benefits\nin accordance with a system approved by the\nresponsible Minister with the consent of the Minister of Finance.\n[34]\nWhen asked by counsel for the appellant whether it was\ncorrect that there had been no resolution by the Council approving\nthe EMCâs\ndecision to increase the gratuity in question, the fourth\nrespondent replied in the affirmative, stating that the decision had\nbeen\ntaken in terms of an existing general delegation. Pressed to\nproduce it, he could not locate the delegation on which he relied.\n[35]\nWhen it was put to the fourth respondent, once again,\nthat there had been no resolution by the Council conferring upon the\nEMC the\npower to make the decision in question, he replied in the\naffirmative. Later, when questioned by the court, he sought to rely\non\na verbal delegation but did so, once again, in vague and\nunsubstantiated terms.\n[36]\nThe fourth respondentâs evidence must be seen against\nthe statutory provisions regulating the manner in which the Council\noperates.\nWe have already referred to ss 8 and 16 of the Act.\n[37]\nSection 13(4) of the Act provides:\nâ\nA decision of the Council shall be taken by\nresolution of the majority of the members present at any meeting of\nthe Council and, in\nthe event of an equality of votes on any matter,\nthe person presiding at the meeting in question shall have a casting\nvote in addition\nto his deliberative vote as a member of the\nCouncil.â\nSection 13(6) of the Act provides:\nâ\nMinutes shall be kept of the proceedings of every\nmeeting of the Council, and shall as soon as possible be confirmed at\na subsequent\nmeeting of the Council.â\n[38]\nImportantly, in terms of s 19(1)(b) of the Act it is for\nthe appellant to determine the remuneration, allowances, subsidies\nand other\nbenefits of the employees and then only in accordance with\na system approved by two Ministers. Terblanche was aware of this as\nthe\ntransparencies that he used in his presentation showed.\n[39]\nA delegation must be clearly proved. See:\nKasiyamhuru\nv Minister of Home Affairs\n1999 (1) SA 643\n(W) at 651 D. In our\nview, the respondents failed to prove the delegated authority upon\nwhich they relied. It follows that the court\nbelow erred in\nconcluding that the decision in question had been authorised. Having\nreached this conclusion it becomes unnecessary\nto consider the\nsubmissions on behalf of the appellant that whatever decision may\nhave led to the amendment of the rules was not\ntaken in accordance\nwith a system approved by the Minister of Agriculture in concurrence\nwith the Minister of Finance as envisaged\nin s 19(1)(b) of the Act.\n[40]\nThe payments were made by the appellant to each of the\nrespondents. In this part of the judgment we deal with the question\nwhether\nthe payments made by the appellant to the Fund in purported\nsatisfaction of obligations arising under Rule 7.17 of the Rules were\npayments received by the Fund or the respondents.\n[41]\nThe importance of the distinction in the present context\nis made clear in the following extract from\nPhillips v Hughes\n;\nHughes v Maphumulo\n1979 (1) SA 225\n(N) at 228H-229 (per\nDidcott J, Hefer J concurring):\nâ\nThe\ncondictio indebiti\ndoes\nnot entitle the\nsolvens\nto\npursue what was mistakenly paid, wherever it goes. The recovery of\nthe undue payment from its\nrecipiens\nis\nthe actionâs sole objective. Wessels explained this in his\nLaw\nof Contract in South Africa\n2\nnd\ned. He wrote (vol 2 paras 3712, 3713 and 3716 at 952-3):\nâ\nEven though a thing is paid in error, the\nsolvens\nintends at the moment he makes the payment to\npass the ownership to the\nrecipiens\n.\nThere is no error as regards the thing which is handed over â the\nerror lies in the\ncausa solvendi\n.\n. . It is the fault of the\nsolvens\nif\nhe is under the impression that a thing is due when it is not; and if\nthrough his act in delivering the thing to the\nrecipiens\na third party acquires rights in that thing,\nthe\nsolvens\nhas only\nhimself to blame. Hence in strict law, as the\nrecipiens\nbecomes the owner in so far that he can give\ntitle by transfer or delivery, the\nsolvens\ncannot vindicate the thing in the hands of a\nthird party . . . The right to bring the\ncondictio\ndoes not attach to the thing, nor does there\nexist any privity between the\nsolvens\nand\nthe third party.â\nThis means that the\ncondictio\nindebiti\nis enforceable against the\nrecipiens\nof the undue payment, but nobody else. The\nrecipiens\nis not\nnecessarily the person into whose hands the money was actually put\nwhen it was paid. He is the one who must be considered,\nin all the\ncircumstances of the case, truly to have received the payment.\nWhenever a payment is made to an agent with authority to\naccept it,\nfor instance, the\nrecipiens\nis\nthe principal, not the agent. A conduit through whom payment passes\nis likewise not its\nrecipiens\n.\nInstead he who obtains payment by such means is. One is not the\nrecipiens\nof a\npayment, on the other hand, merely because it was intended or happens\nin the result to benefit one. That, on its own, does not\ncount. All\nthat matters is whether one can appropriately be said to have\nreceived the payment in some or other way.

This provides as follows:\nâ\nThe ARC shall pay to its employees such remuneration,\nallowances, subsidies and other benefits as the Council may\ndetermine, in accordance\nwith a system approved from time to time by\nthe Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance.â\nThe compensation was either a subsidy or other benefit within the\nmeaning of the section. Whether or not it was authorized, the payment\ntherefore purported to be one made to the employee respondents.\n[43]\nThe rules of the Fund, are in our view, helpful in\ndiscovering the underlying truth. Rule 7.17 provides as follows:\nâ\n(1)\tNotwithstanding any other conditions of the\nRules, the Board shall deduct from the Beneficiaryâs Pension\nbenefit any amount\nfrom such benefit due in terms of the Income Tax\nAct, before the benefit is paid to the beneficiary.\n(2)\tThe Employer increases a Gratuity payable to an\nA-member or his Beneficiary (as the case may be) and to a B-member or\nhis Beneficiary\n(as the case may be) to\ncompensate\nfor any income tax payable by such Member or Beneficiary in terms of\nAnnexure 2 to the Income Tax Act, in respect of a Gratuity in\nterms\nof Rules 4.1 to 4.7 and 5.1 to 5.7 respectively.\n(3)\nThe basis for the increase of\nthe Gratuity in terms of (2) above, and the degree to which a Member\nor his Beneficiary is compensated\nis agreed upon by the Member and\nthe Employer\n. Such compensation is however\nonly payable for as long as, and to the degree that corresponding\nGratuity benefits payable to a member\nof a Previous State Fund are\nexempt of the provisions of Annexure 2 of the Income Tax Act.â\n(Emphasis added.)\nA âpension benefitâ is defined in Rule 2.2 as âa Gratuity\nand/or a Pension as the case may beâ. âGratuityâ means âa\nsingle lump sum amount payable in terms of the Rulesâ.\n[44]\nAll the respondents became entitled to payment of pension\nbenefits by reason of Rule 4.7 the relevant provisions of which\nprovide\nas follows:\nâ\n(1)\tIf an A-memberâs services are terminated by his\nemployer due to his post being abolished, or due to re-organisation\nof  activities\nby the Employer, the following benefits shall be paid\nto the Member:\n. . .\nIf such Memberâs period of Pensionable Service is ten\n\tyears or more, the benefits in terms of Rule 4.4(1) . . .\n(2)\tIn the case of (1) (ii) above, the Employer shall\ncompensate the Fund in respect of any additional liability placed\nupon the Fund\nin this process, in a manner agreed upon by the Fund\nand the Employer. This additional liability shall be determined by\nthe Actuary.\n(3)\tShould the Employer terminate the services of an\nA-member in terms of this rule, the Board may, with the memberâs\napproval arrange\nthe transfer of the Memberâs benefit to an\nApproved Retirement Fund, after which the Fundâs obligation in\nrespect of the Member\nshall cease.â\nRule 4.4(1) provides, in so far as material hereto, that an A-member\nmay retire with benefits in terms of Rule 4.1 which, in turn,\nidentifies the following pension benefits:\nA gratuity of 6,72 percent of his Pensionable\n\tEmoluments on the last day of his period of Pensionable Service,\n\tmultiplied by the\nperiod of his Pensionable Service.\nA Pension . . .â\n[45]\nThe actual procedure adopted by the administrators of the\nFund, prior to the purported amendment of the appellantâs policy\nwhich\ngave rise to the present dispute, and the procedure which it\nproposed to follow in consequence of the amendment, is set out in a\nletter sent by the administrators to the Fund on 30 June 1997 as\nfollows:\nâ\n1.\tAGTERGROND\nReÃ«l 7.17(2) bepaal dat die Werkgewer die gratifikasie\nvoordeel betaalbaar aan ân A-lid of B-lid of hul voordeelgeregtigde\nverhoog\nom te vergoed vir inkomstebelasting wat deur sodanige lid of\nvoordeelgeregtigde betaalbaar mag wees.\nReÃ«l 7.17(3) bepaal dat die basis van sodanige\nverhoging deur die lid en die werkgewer ooreengekom word.\nHUIDIGE PROSEDURE\nDie LNR se hoofbestuur het op 20 November 1992 besluit\ndat die voordeel slegs van toepassing is indien die lid ân\npensioentrekker\nword. (Die besluit is onlangs verander.) Sover my\nkennis strek, is die basis van vergoeding, reÃ«l 7.17(3). nog nooit\ndeur ân spesifieke\nlid en die werkgewer onderhandel nie, en is daar\nook nie ân bestuursbesluit oor die metode wat gebruik moet  word\nnie.\nSodanige verhoging in voordeel word deur Ou Mutual as\ndie administrateur bepaal en aan die lid betaal. Die volgende\nprosedure was\nin plek:\nMet uitdienstrede word ân belastingaanwysing van die\n\tOntvanger aangevra.\nDie belastingbedrag soos aangedui in die\n\tbelastingwysing word van die lid se voordeel verhaal.\nIndien die lid ân pensioentrekker van die Fonds word,\nword die belasting wat van die lid se voordeel verhaal is, deur Ou\nMutual\nas die administrateur van die LNR aangevra en aan die lid\nterugbetaal. Ons kan egter geen enkelbedragvoordeel uitbetaal sonder\nom\nân belastingaanwysing te verkry nie. Dit beteken die Ontvanger\ngaan vanaf die tweede betaling ook belasting verhaal.Indien die\nLNR\ndus slegs die belastingsbedrag aan die Fonds terugbetaal, gaan die\nlid minder as die belastingbedrag ontvang.\nTen einde die probleem te oorkom, beraam Ou Mutual die\nbelasting wat die Ontvanger vanaf die tweede bedrag gaan aanvra, en\nvra dan\ndie LNR om die verhoogde bedrag aan die Fonds te betaal. Die\ngemiddelde koers wat die Ontvanger met die eerste aanslag gebruik\nhet,\nword in die berekening gebruik. Sien Bylaag 1 vir ân voorbeeld\nvan die berekening. Daar word rente bygevoeg tot datum van betaling.\n(Die koers wat gebruik word, is ârente op laat betalingâ soos\ndeur die Trustees bepaal.)\nWanneer die betrokke bedrag vanaf die LNR ontvang word,\n\tword ân belastingaanwysing op die tweede betaling aangevra.\nWanneer die belastingaanwysing ontvang word, word die\n\tbelasting van die tweede betaling verhaal en word die balans aan die\n\tlid uitbetaal.\nUITBREIDING VAN VOORDEEL\nDie LNR se hoofbestuurskomitee het op sy vergadering van\n23 Mei 1997 besluit om die aangeleentheid as volg te verander:\nDie voordeel is van toepassing op alle uidienstredes\n\t(behalwe bedankings) waar die enkelbedrag na 1 Junie 1997 uitbetaaal\n\tword.\nDie vereiste dat die lid ân pensioentrekker moet word,\n\tverval dus.\nDie LNR staan in vir die belasting op die volle\n\tenkelbedrag wat die lid neem, en nie net op die gratifikasie in\n\tterme van die reÃ«ls\nnie. (Indien die lid se voordele in terme van\n\treÃ«l 7.4 uitbetaal word, is ân groter enkelbedragvoordeel\n\tbeskikbaar, soos geÃ¯llustreer\nmet die voorbeeld in Bylaag 1 en\n\tBylaag 2.)\nDit beteken dus dat die LNR in meer gevalle instaan\nvir die belasting\n, en dat die\nbelastingsbedrag hoÃ«r kan wees as wat onder die ou bedeling in die\nLNR gegeld het. Die lede ontvang ook dus ân belastingvoordeel\nwat\nruimer is as onder die RDPF, aangesien die enkelbedrag onder reÃ«l\n7.4 groter kan wees as onder die RDPF.\nDie prosedure wat gevolg gaan word, sal soortgelyk wees\nas wat in die vorige afdeling bespreek is.â\n(Emphasis added.)\n[46]\nFinally, regard should be had to the manner in which the\nparties actually implemented the terms of rule 7.17. The dealings\nbetween\nthe appellant and the third respondent may be taken as\nrepresentative in this regard.\n[47]\nOn 16 May 1997 the third respondent wrote to the fourth\nrespondent in the latterâs capacity as President of the Council in\nthe following\nterms:\nâ\nNa oorweging van verskeie faktore, insluitend my\npersoonlike omstandighede, wil ek graag van hierdie geleentheid\ngebruik maak om aansoek\nte doen vir ân vrywillige skeidingspakket\nooreenkomstig reel\n4.7(1)(ii) van die Reglement\nvan die Landbounavorsingsraadpensioenfonds (LNRPF).

Die samestelling van die\npakket\nis aanvaarbaar en in lyn met LNR diensvoorwaardes.\nJ H TERBLANCHEâ\nThis exchange manifested an agreement of the kind envisaged by rule\n7.17(3).\n[49]\nIn due course SARS issued an âEmployees Tax Deduction\nDirectiveâ to the Fund in respect of each respondent in which the\namount\nof tax and the amount of the lump sum payment concerned was\nstated.\n[50]\nThe Fund then wrote to each of the respondents notifying\nthem that âLNR staan in vir die belasting wat afgetrek is van u\ngratifikasieâ,\nadvising each of the gratuity benefit, the amount of\ntax, accrued interest (where applicable), the total amount of the\ngratuity after\ndeduction of tax, and drawing attention to the payeeâs\nbank statement on a given future date.\n[51]\nThe Fund apparently paid SARS the tax owed on the\ngratuity and the top-up, paid the employee the after-tax amount of\nthe gratuity,\ncalled on the appellant to pay to it a cheque\nequivalent to the top-up under 7.17 and, on receipt thereof, paid an\namount equivalent\nto the tax deducted to the employee. In this regard\na letter dated 26 November 1998 from the Fund Administrators to the\nrepresentatives\nof the appellant seems to reflect the practice:\nâ\nLANDBOUNAVORSINGSRAADPENSIOENFONDS: 53495\nTOEPASSING VAN REÃ«L 7.17: VERHALING VAN BELASTING\nLID NAAM:\t\t\tJH Terblanche\nVERWYSING NR:\t\t47013305\nOns verwys na dokumente ontvang ten opsigte van\nbogenoemde lid se aftrede uit fonds op 30/11/1998\nIn terme van reel 7.17 is die bedrag van:\nR1195766.24\nDeur die LNR aan die Pensioenfonds verskuldig.\n(Sien aangehegte bylae)\nDie nodige belastingaanwysing op bogenoemde bedrag is\nreeds aangevra vanaf die Ontvanger van Inkomste.

That however, in context, means no more than\nthat the Fund required payment by the appellant in order\nto enable it\nto carry out the arrangement.\n[52]\nWe disagree with Streicher JA that amounts paid to\nincrease a gratuity under rule 7.17 fall within the ambit of\ns 13A\nof\nthe\nPension Funds Act 24 of 1956\n. Such increases are neither a\ncontribution which is to be deducted from a memberâs remuneration\n(s 13A(1)(a))\nnor a contribution for which an employer is liable in\nterms of the rules of the Fund\n(s 13A(1)(b).\nIn the last-mentioned\nregard, although increase in an employeeâs gratuity by the employer\nis provided for in the rules, the employer\nis not liable in terms of\nthe rules for such a payment.\nRule 7.17(3)\nmakes it clear that\nliability to pay depends upon and arises from the agreement of\nemployer and employee\ndehors\nthe rules.\nRule 7.17\ndoes no more\nthan furnish a mechanism to give effect to such an agreement. This\ncase provides an illustration: although the four\nrespondents were at\nall material times members of the Fund and entitled to the benefits\nprovided by the rules, their success or failure\nin this application\ndepends on whether their employer validly undertook to extend the\nbenefits of\nRule 7.17\nto their situation. We disagree therefore that\nthe employer intended to make the payments or that the Fund intended\nto receive them\nin discharge of a statutory obligation on the\nemployer.\n[53]\nThe conclusions which in our view may fairly be drawn\nfrom the rules and the partiesâ implementation of them are the\nfollowing:\n(i)\tThe payment by the employer under\nrule 7.17\nwas not the payment\nof a gratuity, ie a lump sum payable in terms of the rules. It was an\namount paid by agreement between employer\nand employee which\ncompensated the employee for the reduction in the amount of the\ngratuity caused by the deduction of his tax liability.\nThe effect was\nan increase in the gratuity.\n(ii)\tThe contractual obligation to pay the compensatory amount to the\nemployee was that of the employer. The Fund was never under\na duty in\nterms of the rules or by contract to pay an increased gratuity to the\nemployee. The Fund did not intend to meet its own\nobligations by\npaying the respondents and, therefore, could not have recovered such\npayments from them by way of condiction.\n(iii)\tAs a matter of practical convenience the Fund calculated and\npaid all the tax owed by the employee (ie on the gratuity and\non the\ntop-up) to SARS. It also paid the employee the gratuity which it was\nobliged under the rules to pay and, after it had received\nthe\nequivalent amount from the employer, the top-up also.\n(iv)\tThe Fund had no interest in the receipt of the top-up except as\na conduit for onward transmission to the employee.\n(v)\tAll the parties co-operated to achieve the desired result within\nthe framework of the Fund rules.\n(vi)\tThe employer and employees could have effected the same\narrangement outside of the rules of the Fund. In the circumstances\nrule 7.17\nshould properly be construed as merely recording the\narrangement between employer and the Fund for the benefit of an\nemployee who\nchooses to rely on its provisions.\n[54]\nThe evidence proves that\nthe employer undertook to pay each of the employees;\nthe employer intended that its payments to the Fund should be\n\ttransmitted to the employees (in several cases with interest\n\tincluded);\nthe Fund had no intention of receiving the top-up or the interest as\n\ta pension fund contribution (or as its own) but intended to\npass it\n\ton to the employees and in fact did so in each case. As counsel put\n\tit, the net effect of the transactions upon the Fund\nwas nil.\n[55]\nFor these reasons we are satisfied that the payments were\nmade to and received by the employees and the role of the fund was\nmerely\none of facilitation and transmission.\n[56]\nIn the result the payments to the employee respondents to\nincrease their gratuities were made by the appellant under a mistaken\nbelief\nthat such payments were authorised, and that it was obliged to\nmake them. The members of the appellantâs Executive Committee seem\nto have laboured under a genuine misapprehension that they were\nauthorised by the Council to extend the employee benefits as they\ndid. The fourth respondent was chairman of the Committee as well as\npresident of the Council and there were other common members\nas well.\nIn the circumstances the appellantâs mistake was excusable. The\ncondictio indebiti\nwas therefore available to it.\n[57]\nThe appeal should accordingly succeed with costs\nincluding the costs of two counsel. The order of the Court\na quo\nshould be set aside and replaced with the following:\n1.\tThe defendants are ordered to pay the following amounts to the\nplaintiff-\n1.1\tthe first defendant: R530 961,93;\n1.2\tthe second defendant: R422 221,95;\n1.3\tthe third defendant: R265 635,55;\n1.4\tthe fourth defendant: 1 189 898,25.\n2.\tEach of the said amounts bears interest\na tempore morae\nat\n15,5% per annum from the date of service of the summons on the\ndefendant concerned until date of payment.\n3.\tThe defendants are to pay the costs of suit including the costs\nattendant upon the employment of two counsel.\n_____________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\n______\n____________________\nJ A HEHER\nJUDGE\nOF APPEAL\nNUGENT JA\n:\n[58]\tI agree with the order that is proposed by Streicher J. Payment\nbeing a bilateral juristic act,\n4\nthe question whether the payments were made to and received by the\nFund as principal (or merely as agent for the respondents) depends\nupon what the parties intended. That is in turn a question of fact\nupon which the appellant bore the burden of proof.\n[59]\tThe appellant led no evidence to establish that the payment was\nintended to be made to and received by the Fund as agent for\nthe\nrespondents and that was also not expressly dealt with in the agreed\nfacts. Counsel for the appellant referred us to the paragraph\nof the\nagreed facts in which the parties agreed that the payments\nâamount[ed] to the payment of remuneration, alternatively an\nallowance, alternatively a subsidy, alternatively a benefit as\ncontemplated by\ns 19\nof the Actâ (that section authorises the\nappellant to make payments of that kind âto its employeesâ) but\nclearly that was intended\nto be no more than an admission that the\npayments fell within the authority conferred upon the appellant by\nthe statute, and it does\nnot follow that the payments were in fact\nmade to the respondents directly (represented by an agent). It is\nquite apparent that notwithstanding\nthat agreement it remained in\nissue whether the payments were in fact made to the respondents, or\nwhether they were made to the Fund.\n[60]\tNo doubt the existence or otherwise of obligations between the\nparties allows for inferences to be drawn in appropriate cases\nas to\nwhat was intended when a payment was made. I agree with Streicher JA\nthat in the present case the rules cast an obligation\nupon the\nappellant, enforceable by the respondents, to pay the relevant\namounts to the Fund, and that once that was done the Fund\nbecame\nliable to pay the increased gratuity to the respondents. But even if\nthat construction of the rules is not correct that is\nnevertheless\nhow the appellant and the Fund appear to have understood them, for\naccording to the agreed facts â[the appellant]\ncaused the Fund to\nincrease the gratuity payable to the [respondents] â¦ and [the\nappellant] paid the certain amounts to the Fund\nin respect of each of\nthe [respondents].â Moreover, the correspondence from the Fund to\nthe appellant is consistent with that understanding\nof the nature of\nthe obligations. And if that was the understanding of the appellant\nand the Fund I see no reason not to infer that\nthey acted in\naccordance with that understanding.\n[61]\tI find nothing in any of the facts that have been placed before\nus, whether in the agreed facts or in the evidence, from which\nto\ninfer that the appellant and the Fund had a contrary intention when\nthe moneys were paid. On the contrary the appellant itself\nalleged in\nits particulars of claim that it âcaused the Fund to increase the\ngratuity payable to [the respondents]â and that\nit in turn âpaid\nthe Fundâ the relevant amounts. Its case against the respondents\nwas founded on no more than the bald assertion\nin the particulars of\nclaim that âin the premisesâ the payments were made to the\nrespondents, but there are no facts to support\nthat leap.  In my view\nit is probable that both the appellant and the Fund intended the\npayments to be made to and received by the\nFund as principal and\naccordingly the claim must fail.\n__________________\nR W NUGENT\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nERASMUS AJA)\tCONCUR\n1\nThe appellant.\n2\nThe Fund.\n3\nKopman and Another v Benjamin\n1951 (1) SA 882\n(WLD) on 886E\n4\nSaambou-Nasionale Bouvereniging v Friedman\n1979 (3) SA 978\n(A) 993A-C;\nVolkskas Bank v Bankorp Bpk (h/a Trust Bank)\n[1991] ZASCA 57\n;\n1991\n\t(3) SA 605\n(A) 612C-E;\nPfeiffer v First National Bank of First\n\tNational Bank of SA Ltd\n1998 (3) SA 1018\n(A) 1025I-J.",

    "facts": "The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established under the Agricultural Research Council Act 86 of 1990 and created a pension fund under the Pension Funds Act. Twelve research institutes were transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the ARC, and their employees, including the four respondents, became members of the Fund. Between 1997 and 1998 the respondents terminated their membership in accordance with various rules of the Fund and exercised the option in rule 7.4 to receive a gratuity instead of a full pension benefit. Under rule 7.17 the employer may increase a gratuity to compensate for income tax payable; the increase is to be agreed between the employee and employer. The ARC, through its Executive Management Committee (EMC), decided to increase the gratuities and paid substantial sums to the Fund so that, after tax deductions, the respondents would receive the full gratuity amounts. The Fund then paid tax to SARS and transferred the increased gratuities to the respondents. The ARC later sued the respondents for repayment, arguing that the payments were made to the Fund without authority and amounted to an undue payment (condictio indebiti).",
    "issues": "1) Whether the ARC had proper delegated authority for the EMC to decide on the increase of gratuities under rule 7.17. 2) Whether the sums paid by the ARC to the Fund constitute payments made by the ARC to the respondents, thereby giving rise to a claim of condictio indebiti against them. 3) Whether the ARC may recover the amounts from the respondents under the statutory and contractual framework governing the pension fund.",
    "principles": "The court considered the doctrine of condictio indebiti, which permits recovery of payments made by mistake against the recipient when there is no valid obligation. Relevant case law includes Licences and General Insurance Co v Ismay (1951) and Vorster v Marine & Trade Versekeringsmaatskappy Bpk (1968), which address payments made at the request of another party. The distinction between a payment to an agent and to a principal was examined, relying on Phillips v Hughes and the principle that the recipient of an unlawful payment is the one who actually receives the benefit, not merely a conduit. The statutory framework was analyzed: s 13A of the Pension Funds Act regarding employer contributions, s 19(1)(b) of the ARC Act on employer obligations, and the delegation provisions in ss 8 and 16 of the ARC Act. The court also applied the interpretation of rule 7.17, which creates a contractual obligation between employer and employee, not a statutory contribution to the Fund.",
    "application": "Streicher JA concluded that the payments were made to the Fund to satisfy a statutory liability and therefore were not payments to the respondents; consequently the condictio indebiti could not be claimed against them and the appeal was dismissed. The majority (Navsa JA, Heher JJA, Erasmus AJA) found that the EMC lacked clear delegated authority, rendering the payments unauthorized. They held that the ARC intended the payments to benefit the respondents directly, making the respondents the true recipients under condictio indebiti. Accordingly, the earlier order was set aside and the respondents were ordered to repay the amounts, with interest and costs, as the payments were mistakenly made to the Fund as a conduit.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded. The court set aside the judgment of the Transvaal Provincial Division and ordered each respondent to repay the respective sums paid by the ARC (R530,961.93; R422,221.95; R265,635.55; R1,189,898.25) with interest at 15.5% per annum from summons service until payment, and to pay the costs of the suit, including the costs of two counsel."
