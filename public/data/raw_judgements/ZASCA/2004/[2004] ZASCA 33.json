The respondent is the franchisor\nof a chain of general retail shops\nthroughout South Africa.  It conducts business as the central purchase\norganization for commodities\nwhich it sells to the members of the franchise. The\nJumbo Trust became such a member in July 2000 in terms of a written agreement\nwith the respondent. On 21 August 2000 it caused a continuing notarial covering\nbond to be registered over its (unspecified) movable\nassets in order to secure\npayment of amounts owing by it to the respondent from time to time.\n[2]\tAt 26\nSeptember 2001 the Trust was in arrears and indebted to the respondent in the\nsum of R2 371 804,34 together with interest\nfrom 1 September 2001 at the rate of\n2,3% per month. It possessed trading stock to the value of about R400 000,00 but\nrefused to\nallow the appellant to perfect its bond. It appeared to be trading in\ninsolvent circumstances, creating an obvious and imminent threat\nto the\nrespondent’s security. The appellant, the trustee, refused either to hand\nover the keys of the business to the respondent\nor to deliver any of its\nmovables or stock in trade for the purposes of allowing the respondent to\nperfect its bond. The Trust was\nwithout cash to purchase goods and was simply\ndiminishing its existing stock without reducing its indebtedness to the\nrespondent.\n[3]\nClause 14 of the bond conditions provided as\nfollows:\n‘14.1 IF:\n14.1.1\tthere should be a default in the timeous fulfilment of any obligation\nimposed upon the MORTGAGOR in terms hereof,\nOR\n14.1.2\t. . .\n14.1.3\tThe MORTGAGEE has at any time reason to believe that his interests are in\nany way imperilled by any act or omission on the\npart of the MORTGAGOR or any of\nhis officers, servants or agents or any creditor of the MORTGAGOR or in any\nother circumstance reasonable\nin the context thereof, the MORTGAGEE shall,\nnotwithstanding any prior waiver, enjoy the rights and remedies set out in the\nsucceeding\nsub-paragraphs, and the MORTGAGOR indemnifies the MORTGAGEE and any\nagent of the MORTGAGEE against any claim of whatsoever nature\nthat may be\ninstituted in consequence of any exercise thereof by the MORTGAGEE; it is,\nmoreover, confirmed and agreed that neither\nthe MORTGAGEE nor any agent of the\nMORTGAGEE shall in the exercise of the hereinaftermentioned rights and remedies\nbe liable for\nany loss or damage suffered, including loss or damage occasioned\nas a result of negligence.\n14.2\tThe MORTGAGEE shall forthwith be entitled without prior notice to the\nMORTGAGOR and the MORTGAGOR hereby irrevocably and unconditionally\nauthorizes\nand empowers the MORTGAGEE (with power of substitution):\n14.2.1\tTo take and retain at the expense of the MORTGAGOR possession of the\nbusiness of the MORTGAGOR and/or the assets of the MORTGAGOR\n(as the case may\nbe) hereby hypothecated as security for any amounts owing to the MORTGAGEE in\nterms hereof and whether due or not;\n14.2.2\tTo conduct the business of the MORTGAGOR in name and for the account and\nrisk of the MORTGAGOR, and to which end the MORTGAGEE\nshall, moreover, be\nentitled:\n14.2.2.1\tTo purchase stock from time to\ntime;\n14.2.2.2\tTo recover all moneys owing to the MORTGAGOR and for which purpose to\ntake such action, including the institution of legal\naction, as is deemed\nnecessary, to issue valid receipts and in his discretion to grant extension,\ncompromise any claim and to apply\nmoneys recovered either for the conduct of the\nbusiness and/or settlement or reduction of any amount owing by the MORTGAGOR in\nterms\nhereof, and pay any surplus to the MORTGAGOR;\n14.2.2.3\tTo operate and draw on the banking account of the MORTGAGOR and to\ninstruct that all funds in such account, or which may\nbe paid into such account,\nbe paid to the MORTGAGEE or not be withdrawn therefrom except by or to the order\nof the MORTGAGEE.\n14.2.2.4\tTo complete, sign and lodge all requisite documents for the retention\nof all licences, permits, quotas, concessions and\nregistration certificates of\nthe business and to this end the MORTGAGEE shall, furthermore, be entitled in\nhis discretion to appoint\na nominee in the place of the MORTGAGOR;\n14.2.2.5\tTo perform all such further acts in the conduct of the business as the\nMORTGAGEE deems necessary;\nAND/OR\n14.3\nThe\nMORTGAGEE shall, whether or not he shall have exercised his rights in terms of\nsub-paragraph 14.2 above, be entitled and the MORTGAGOR\nhereby irrevocably and\nunconditionally authorizes and empowers the MORTGAGEE or his agent to sell and\ndispose of the business and/or\nthe assets hypothecated in terms hereof (as the\ncase may be) or any portion thereof by public auction, public tender or private\ntreaty\non such terms as the MORTGAGEE may decide and to this\nend:\n14.3.1\tTo sign all requisite documents and perform all necessary acts to convey\nvalid title to the purchaser or transferee, and\n14.3.2\tTo collect and take receipt of the purchase price which shall be applied\nin the first instance to defray all costs and charges\nrelating to such sale and\nthereafter in settlement or reduction of amounts owing by the MORTGAGOR to the\nMORTGAGEE in terms hereof,\nand the surplus (if any) shall be paid to the\nMORTGAGOR, save that if only a portion of the assets hypothecated in terms\nhereof are\nthus sold, and the MORTGAGEE has exercised his rights in terms of\nsub-paragraph 14.2 above and is still so exercising these rights,\nthe surplus\nmay be retained by the MORTGAGEE in his sole discretion in the continued conduct\nof the MORTGAGOR’s business;\nAND/OR\n14.4\nThe\nMORTGAGEE shall be entitled to claim and recover all amounts owing in terms\nhereof (whether due or not) from the MORTGAGOR together\nwith finance charges as\nherein prescribed and all legal costs on an attorney and client scale (including\ncollection charges at the\nruling rate) and for this\npurpose:\n14.4.1\tTo obtain Provisional, Summary or final Judgment from a competent Court\nand\n14.4.2\tTo have any or all of the assets hypothecated in terms hereof excussed by\nlegal process\nAND/OR\n14.5\nThe\nMORTGAGEE shall be entitled to any other remedy as is in Law\nallowed,\nOR\n14.6\tThe MORTGAGEE shall be entitled to expend any amount on behalf of the\nMORTGAGOR as is necessary for the latter’s fulfilment\nof his obligations\nin terms hereof and to recover the amount so expended from the MORTGAGOR with\nfinance charges as provided in paragraph\n5.0 above and costs on an attorney and\nclient scale (including collection costs at the ruling\nrate).’\n[4]\nThe respondent applied\nex parte\nfor an interim order to protect and enforce its rights under clause 14 of\nthe bond. A rule\nnisi\nwas thereupon issued by Squires J which called on\nthe appellant to show cause why an order in the following terms (inter alia)\nshould\nnot be made:\n‘2.1\tThe applicant be and is hereby authorized and empowered for the\npurposes of protecting its security in terms of a General\nNotarial Covering Bond\nduly registered under No BN23853/2000 to enter upon the premises of the\nrespondent and to take possession\nof all respondent’s movable property as\ndefined in clause 1.2.1 of the said Notarial Bond on the said premises or where\nsuch\nmovable assets may be found, and to retain such assets for so long as the\napplicant may deem fit as security for the payment of all\namounts owing or which\nmay become owing by the respondent to the applicant and to exercise any of its\nrights under and in terms of\nthe said Notarial Bond as set out in paragraph 14.2\nand 14.3.\n2.2\tThe respondent be and [is] hereby interdicted and restrained from dealing\nwith, alienating, disposing of, or in any way dissipating\nor removing any of\nsuch movable assets hypothecated in favour of the applicant without the written\nconsent of the applicant first\nbeing obtained.\n2.3\tThat the applicant must institute action against the respondent within (30)\nthirty days of confirmation of this order for payment\nof the outstanding amount\nof R2 371 804,34 together with interest thereon.\n2.4\tThe applicant is to compile a full and complete inventory of all goods\nseized in terms of this order and on completion thereof\nwhich shall not be later\nthan three days of this order, to deliver a copy to the respondent.\n2.5\tThe applicant is to keep a full and detailed record of the sales of any\ngoods in pursuance of clauses 14.2 and 14.3 and to make\nsuch available to\nrespondent on five (5) days notice.\n2.6\tThe respondent is ordered to pay the costs of this application on the scale\nbetween attorney and client.’\nIn addition the order\nprovided:\n‘3.\tThe order in paragraph 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 above shall immediately\noperate as an order pending the final determination\nof this application provided\nthat the rights in terms of paragraph 14.3 will not be exercised until a period\nof 48 hours after service\nof the order herein.\n4.\tThe orders in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 are subject to the condition that the\napplicant agrees and undertakes to be liable to the\nrespondents for any damages\nproved to have been suffered by them as a result of the granting of the\ninterdict, should the applicant’s\naction in paragraph 2.3\nfail.’\n[5]\nThe appellant opposed the confirmation of\nthe rule. Save as appears hereafter its grounds of opposition are no longer\nrelevant. Hurt\nJ, however, confirmed the rule and extended the operation of\nparagraph 3 of the order in so far as the present respondent had not\nyet\nexercised its rights to sell any of the bonded properties. He granted leave to\nappeal to this Court against his order.\nThe judgment of the Court\na\nquo\n[6]\tCounsel for the appellant submitted that it was not\nproved before Hurt J that the Trust was a debtor of the respondent and that\nthis\nquestion was, therefore, moot before us. That, he said, was why the learned\nJudge had confirmed para 2.2 of the rule requiring\nthe respondent to institute\naction for payment. In those circumstances perfection of the bond should either\nnot have been granted\nor, if it was, public policy demanded that the terms of\nthe order should be materially cut down. The response of counsel for the\nrespondent was that the question of the Trust’s indebtedness had been\ndecided and thus rendered\nres judicata\nby the judgment of the Court\na\nquo\n. Para 2.2 meant, he submitted, that, in the action the respondent had\nonly to prove the quantum of the debt.\n[7]\tOne of the respondent’s\ngrounds for invoking clause 14 of the bond was a breach by the Trust of its\nobligation to make payments\nin reduction of its indebtedness. In his answering\naffidavit the appellant denied that the Trust was in debt to the respondent. He\nrelied on a wide range of alleged breaches of contract which were said to give\nrise to ‘a substantial counterclaim for past,\npresent and future\ndamages’ which were as yet unquantified. He averred that there was\n‘complete uncertainty until a proper\ndebatement of the account has been\ndone, of the [Trust’s] indebtedness to the [Respondent]’. Of this\nissue Hurt J said\nin his reasons for judgment\n‘The debt claimed and\ncertified by the [respondent] is a very substantial one. Before the [respondent]\ncould be disentitled\nfrom invoking its powers under the bond, material\nmalperformance by it, or a very substantial counterclaim, would have to be\nestablished.\nIt is inconceivable that the [Trust] would have supinely submitted\nto this type of treatment at the hands of the [respondent] without\nprotesting\nand endeavouring to enforce its rights. It is equally inconceivable the [Trust]\nwould have made the settlement proposals\nwhich resulted in the agreement of 18\nJuly 2001 if, in fact, it genuinely disputed the [respondent’s] claims\nagainst it. In\nthe circumstances, I do not consider that the apparent dispute of\nfact on the papers is, indeed, a “genuine dispute”\nas contemplated\nin the authorities . . .’\nThese findings were not challenged in the\nappeal. The only issue was their meaning. In the context, the agreement of 18\nJuly 2001\nto which Hurt J referred is not without relevance: the Trust undertook\nto pay its outstanding debt, then R3 056 953,01, by means\nof a loan (which it\nwas to raise) at a rate of R100 000 per month above the existing payment terms.\nIn turn, the credit facility\nprovided by the respondent would be reduced to not\nmore than R150 000 per month payable at the end of each month.\n[8]\tI think\nthat the quoted passage disposes of the initial question. The learned Judge\nfound that the present respondent had,\nfor the purpose of justifying its\napplication to perfect\n, proved that the Trust was its debtor in a\nsubstantial sum. It was unnecessary for him to quantify the entitlement and he\nchose not\nto do so. Instead, he left it to the respondent to prove its claim in\nthe ordinary course at a trial in which the Trust could again\nraise such\ncounterclaims as were available to it. On that interpretation the issue of\nindebtedness is\nres judicata\nonly in so far as the perfection proceedings\nare concerned, and the appropriateness of the order therein. As that is the\nsubject of\nthis appeal I conclude that we must proceed on an acceptance that the\nTrust has been proved to be in debt to the respondent in a\nsubstantial sum of\nmoney.\n[9]\tHurt J declined to follow the reasoning of Froneman J in\nFindevco (Pty) Ltd v Faceformat SA (Pty) Ltd\n2001 (1) SA 251\n(E). His\nrefusal was proved justified by the decision of this Court in\nBock and Others\nv Duburoro Investments (Pty) Ltd\n[2003] 4 All SA 103\n(SCA). He further held\nthat the common law of contract does not allow\nparate\nexecution in a\nmanner which infringes the right of recourse to the courts entrenched in s 34 of\nthe Constitution.\nAfter referring to certain decided cases Hurt J\nsaid:\n‘In the case of\nSasfin (Pty) Ltd v Beukes\n1989(1) SA 1\nSmalberger JA,\nsaid, in relation to a clause of a contract which was\nbeing examined for the purpose of deciding whether it was contrary to public\npolicy:-\n“In addition, clause 3.4.2, which provides for\nparate executie\n,\ngoes to such lengths that it offends against the public interest and is contrary\nto public policy. A clause for\nparate executie\n, which authorizes\nexecution without an order of court, is valid (\nOsry v Hirsch, Loubser &\nCo Ltd\n1922 CPD 531)\n, provided it does not prejudice, or is not likely to\nprejudice, the rights of the debtor unduly. This I conceive to be the principle\nunderlying the passage in the judgment of\nKotze JP\nin\nOsry\n’s\ncase at page 547, where he stated\n‘It is, however, open to the debtor to seek the protection of the court\nif, upon any just ground, he can show that, in carrying\nout the agreement and\neffecting a sale, the creditor has acted in a manner which has prejudiced him in\nhis rights.’\nClause 3.4.2 is couched in very wide terms. It gives\nSasfin\ncarte blanche\nin regard to the sale of\nBeukes\n’ book debts. It is open to abuse,\nand the likelihood of undue prejudice to\nBeukes\nexists if its terms are\nenforced. As stated in\nEastwood v Shepstone\n(supra), it is the tendency\nof the proposed transaction, not its actually proved result, which determines\nwhether it is contrary to\npublic policy.”\nAs I understand\nthe above passage, it is open to the debtor to impugn the validity of the clause\nfor\nparate\nexecution on the ground that it is against public policy\n(which he obviously does as soon as he receives notice that the creditor\nintends\ninvoking the clause) or to challenge the manner in which the creditor goes about\nenforcing the clause. There are no contentions,\nbefore me, to the effect that\nclause 14 of the bond in question is\ncontra bonos mores\n.\nIn summary,\nthe common law, insofar as stipulations for\nparate\nexecution are\nconcerned, is that stipulations, which are not so far-reaching as to be contrary\nto public policy, are valid and enforceable;\nthat, as a matter of practice,\ncreditors seeking to enforce such stipulations take the precaution of applying\nfor judicial sanction\nbefore doing so; and that the debtor can avail himself of\nthe court’s assistance in order to protect himself against prejudice\nat\nthe hands of the creditor.’\nTo this I would add that the ‘matter\nof practice’ referred to is in fact a constitutional requirement:\ncreditors not in\npossession are obliged to apply for judicial sanction. With\nthat qualification, Hurt J’s exposition seems to me to be a correct\nsummary of the present state of the common law.\n[10]\tThe learned Judge\nproceeded to consider whether the common law, as summarized, requires\ndevelopment or modification to bring\nit into conformity with the Constitution\nhaving regard to the requirements of s 39(2) thereof and the terms of sections 8\nand 173,\nand, in particular the right conferred by s 34:\n‘Everyone has\nthe right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law\ndecided in a fair public hearing\nbefore a court or, where appropriate, another\nindependent and impartial tribunal or forum.’\nHis conclusion was that\nwhile\nparate executie\nin theory detracted from the entrenched right, in\npractice the clause was hedged about with conditions which fully preserve the\ndebtor’s\nright to approach a court for relief. He said, with reference to\ns 39(3) of the Constitution\n‘A court should be chary of developing the\ncommon law in a way which impinges upon the fundamental principles of contract\nsuch\nas the freedom to contract on properly consensual terms and the principle\nof\npacta sunt servanda\nwhich I think it can safely be said, are\nfundamentally consistent with the Bill of Rights.’\nAccordingly he\ndecided that\n‘there is no aspect of the common law relating to the type\nof contractual stipulation for\nparate\nexecution in the bond in this case\nwhich needs modification in order to bring it into line with the\nConstitution.’\n[11]\nThe issues on appeal\nThe submissions of\nthe appellant appear to be broader than those addressed to Hurt J. They are, in\nsummary-\nAs to the common law:\nThe tendency of the conditions in clauses 14.2 and 14.3 of the bond, in\nparticular, was such as to expose the debtor to exploitation\nby the creditor to\nan extent which was unconscionable and incompatible with the public interest.\nThe elements which in their individual\nand cumulative effect are said to\nmanifest this tendency are-\n(a)\nthe power to trade, which\nvests total control of the business in the hands of the\ncreditor;\n(b)\nthe power to operate and draw on\nthe banking account of the business;\n(c)\nthe\npower to retain any surplus for the conduct of the business, even, so counsel\nsubmitted, when nothing is owing by the debtor to\nthe\ncreditor;\n(d)\nthe powers under clause 14.2 are\nirrevocable and unconditional; appellant’s counsel submitted that the\ndebtor had no power to\nterminate the agreement or to bring the forced\nadministration to an end although the indebtedness was fully\ndischarged;\n(e)\nthe continuation of the bond,\nnotwithstanding interim settlement, was an invalid\npactum\ncommissorium\n;\n(f)\nthe creditor was not\nliable for loss or damage including loss or damage suffered as a result of\nnegligence;\n(g)\nthe\nparate executie\npower in clause 14.3 is too wide, especially in regard to the exemption from\nliability for negligence; there is no appropriate remedy\nagainst prejudicial\naction by the respondent. (On appeal, the respondent did not rely on the effect\nof the exemptions, wisely in\nview of the judgment in\nSasfin supra\nat\n15F.)\nAs to the Constitution:\n(On the\nconstitutional imperative to develop the common law see\nCarmichele v Minister\nof Safety and Security\n[2001] ZACC 22\n;\n2001 (4) SA 938\n(CC) at paras [33]-[40],\nS v\nThebus and Another\n[2003] ZACC 12\n;\n2003 (6) SA 505\n(CC) at paras [24]-[32].) Although\ninitially counsel submitted boldly that the common law required development, in\nthe course of\nargument it appeared that his sole suggestion for development was\nthat the remedy should be available only to a creditor whose debt\nis undisputed.\nHe expressly disavowed any attack on binding precedent. As I have already\nconcluded, the proper interpretation of\nthe judgment in the court below is that\nthe existence of the debt was for purposes of these proceedings placed beyond\ndispute. As\nthe summary in para [9] above makes clear, the common law does not\nlimit the right of access to the courts. Nor does it fall short\nof the spirit,\npurport or objects of the Bill of Rights. The need to consider this aspect\nfurther accordingly falls away.\n[12]\tBecause the courts will conclude that\ncontractual provisions are contrary to public policy only when that is their\nclear effect\n(see the authorities cited in\nSasfin (Pty) Ltd v Beukes\n1989\n(1) SA 1\n(A) at 8C-9G) it follows that the tendency of a proposed transaction\ntowards such a conflict (\nEastwood v Shepstone\n1902 TS 294\nat 302) can\nonly be found to exist if there is a probability that unconscionable, immoral or\nillegal conduct will result from the\nimplementation of the provisions according\nto their tenor. (It may be that the cumulative effect of implementation of\nprovisions\nnot individually objectionable may disclose such a tendency.) If,\nhowever, a contractual provision is capable of implementation in\na manner that\nis against public policy but the tenor of the provision is neutral then the\noffending tendency is absent. In such event\nthe creditor who implements the\ncontract in a manner which is unconscionable, illegal or immoral will find that\na court refuses to\ngive effect to his conduct but the contract itself will\nstand. Much of the appellant’s reliance before us on considerations\nof\npublic policy suffered from a failure to make the distinction between the\ncontract and its implementation and the unjustified\nassumption that, because its\nterms were open to oppressive abuse by the creditor, they must, as a necessary\nconsequence, be against\npublic policy.\n[13]\tAn attempt to identify the\ntendency of contractual provisions may require consideration of the purpose of\nthe contract, discernible\nfrom its terms and from the objective circumstances of\nits conclusion. The present is such a case.\n[14]\tTo regard the case as simply\none of a creditor exacting security in return for lending money to his debtor,\nas counsel for the\nappellant would have us do, is a gross over-simplification.\nThe relationship between the parties was complex and the bond was an\nimportant\nelement in its regulation.\n[15]\tA retailer who wishes to take advantage of\nthe respondent’s access to bulk purchases must become a member of the\nfranchise\noperated by the respondent. By purchasing stock through the respondent\na franchisee obtains favourable credit terms, as well as the\nbenefit of\nparticipation in a well-known national chain. The supplier invoices the\nrespondent directly and the respondent pays the\nsupplier directly and is in turn\npaid by the member.\n[16]\tThe appellant intended to establish a supermarket in\nPort Shepstone. The appellant applied for membership of the franchise in\nJuly\n2001 and on 28 August 2001 a written agreement was concluded between the\nparties. There is nothing in the papers to gainsay\nthe impression that they\ncontracted on an entirely equal footing for their mutual profit. The scale of\ntheir ambitions may be gauged\nfrom the fact that the appellant apparently spent\nsome R1,4 million on equipping the premises and the price of the initial stock\nof products supplied on credit by the respondent was about R2\nmillion.\n[17]\tClause 18.1 of the agreement required the appellant to register\na continuing covering bond over its movable assets in order to\nsecure its\nindebtedness to the respondent from time to time. The security which was duly\nprovided was a general notarial bond in\nwhich there was no identification of the\nspecific assets covered by it.\n[18]\tThe agreement neither specified the\nduration of the franchise nor provided specifically for its termination by the\nappellant.\nOn general principles the franchise was, therefore, terminable on\nreasonable notice to the respondent. The bond would continue to\nremain operative\nwhile the franchise agreement subsisted or, after its termination, for as long\nas the appellant remained indebted\nto the respondent but thereafter the\ncausa\nfor its existence would cease to exist.\n[19]\tThe franchise\nagreement was premised on an ongoing relationship of debtor and creditor. The\nagreement makes it clear that the\nappellant was buying into an established name,\nreputation and goodwill (attaching to an ‘OK store’). The location\nof\nthe store (clause 3.3), its productivity and viability (clause 4.4), method\nof operation (clauses 6.3 and 6.4), the standards which\nthe appellant was\nrequired to maintain (clause 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 12.1 and 12.4) and the public\nidentification of the franchise (clause\n8.1) are material aspects of the\nagreement which reflect the importance attached by both parties to the\nsuccessful operation of the\nbusiness.\n[20]\tThe parties contemplated that at\nany given time a substantial proportion of the goods in the store would be\nsubject to a reservation\nof ownership in favour of the respondent (clauses 10.3\nand 19.1).\n[21]\tThe nature of the business rendered it likely that much of\nthe stock would be of a perishable nature. The stock was of such a\nnature as to\nbe constantly disposed of and replaced. The respondent’s security lay\nalmost entirely in the stock and equipment\nand in the value of the goodwill\nwhich attached to the business. (The relevance of the allegations made by the\nrespondent in its\naffidavits that the appellant was disposing of its stock, was\nnot possessed of resources to replace stock and had ceased to reduce\nits\nindebtedness to the respondent, is obvious.)\n[22]\tThe parties agreed that the\nrespondent should possess rights of inspection, accounting, auditing and access\nto all books of account\nand tax records of the appellant (clauses 14.2 and\n14.3).\n[23]\tThe agreement manifested a clear intention that should the\nappellant default or the business fail the respondent would have the\nright to\nkeep the lease of the premises alive (clause 12.10.1), take over operation of\nthe store and continue the business at the\nsame location (clauses 12.10.2 and\n12.10.3), with the obvious, albeit unstated, purpose of affording the respondent\nan opportunity\nof finding a new franchisee who would be able to take over an\nexisting business. On termination of the franchise agreement the appellant\nwould\nbe excluded from any further involvement at the location, in the business or in\na competing business (clauses 17.4 and 17.6).\n[24]\tA comparison of the terms\nof the agreement with the conditions of the bond, particularly clause 14,\ndemonstrates the complementary\neffect of the latter. The thread which connects\nthe two is the importance of maintaining the business as a going concern in a\nsingle\nlocation irrespective of the success or failure of the appellant’s\nenterprise.\n[25]\tThe appellant’s counsel censured the use and effects\nof the phrase ‘without prior notice to the MORTGAGOR’\nin clause\n14.2. He contended that it authorized self-help in relation to all the powers\nconferred by the succeeding sub-clauses.\nThe necessary implication, he said, was\nthat the respondent could at its whim move into the premises, expel the\nappellant’s\nrepresentatives, take over the business and run it at the\nappellant’s risk but principally for its own profit without consulting\nthe\nappellant on any matter. I do not think the phrase bears those nuances or that,\nproperly interpreted, it gives the respondent\ncarte blanche in matters affecting\nthe appellant. In the first place the right to invoke clause 14.2 arises only if\nthe preconditions\nof default, insolvency or imperilment are satisfied. There is\nno indication whatsoever of an intention to make the respondent a judge\nin its\nown cause in those matters or to exclude adjudication by a court of law. Second,\nthe phrase itself merely regulates the rights\nof the parties\nvis-à-vis\neach other but says nothing about ousting the authority of the courts or\nrestricting the appellant’s access to them or making\nunnecessary a prior\napplication to court for the perfection of the respondent’s security.\nGiven the rule of interpretation\nwhich promotes validity rather than invalidity\n(‘\nut res magis valeat quam pereat’)\nand the presumption that\nparties to a contract intend it to be implemented in a lawful manner if that can\nbe done, clause 14.1 can\nand should be construed in a sense consistent with the\nexisting common law. Despite the passing of the bond the secured movables\nremained in possession of the debtor. To obtain a real right over its security\nthe creditor needed to obtain possession, either by\nprocuring the\nmortgagor’s consent and co-operation or by obtaining judicial sanction:\nBock & Others v Duburoro Investments (Pty) Ltd\n,\nsupra\nat para\n[14].\n[26]\tThat is what the respondent did. Although neither the contract nor\nthe common law required a court order for the exercise of\nthe additional powers\nin clauses 14.2.2 to 14.6, the respondent expressly sought approval for the\nexercise of the power to conduct\nthe business in the manner provided in clause\n14.2.2, to sell and dispose of the business or assets in terms of clause 14.3\nand to\nproceed as contemplated in clauses 14.5 and 14.6. I have already made it\nclear that it did require court sanction to take possession\nin terms of clause\n14.2.1, which it also obtained. That the respondent subjected the terms of the\ncontract and its implementation\nto the intervention and oversight of the court\ntakes much of the sting out of the appellant’s complaint about the\narbitrary,\nunreasonable and oppressive nature of the contractual powers\nconferred on it. While the taking over of a business as a going concern\nto\nsecure a debt is a fairly drastic step which can, if abused, inflict hardship on\na debtor, the context of the contractual powers\nin the bond under consideration\nrenders the provision and exercise of the power commercially intelligible and\ncombines adequate protection\nof the (largely perishable) security with\nrealization of it in a manner calculated to achieve a realistic price (which\nwould certainly\nbe a lesser prospect were the creditor tied to a forced sale).\nMoreover, as counsel for the respondent pointed out, in exercising\nthe\ndiscretionary powers inherent in operating and selling the business and the\nassets the respondent is obliged to act reasonably\nand to exercise reasonable\njudgment (\narbitrio boni viri\n):\nNBS Boland Bank Ltd v One Berg River\nDrive CC and Others\n;\nDeeb and Another v Absa Bank Ltd\n;\nFriedman v\nStandard Bank of SA Ltd\n1999 (4) SA 928\n(SCA) at 937A-F. Moreover, the\neffect of clause 14.2.2 is that the mortgagee acts to all intents and purposes\nas the agent of the\nmortgagor in exercising its powers and subject to the duties\nin law that flow from that relationship.\n[27]\tCounsel for the appellant\nsuggested that clauses 14.2.2 and 14.3 both permit the mortgagee to carry on the\nbusiness indefinitely\nwhile maintaining an ongoing indebtedness by the mortgagor\nto itself by the simple expedient of continuing to purchase on credit\non the\nmortgagor’s behalf. This, he submitted, demonstrated the oppressive force\nof the provisions. I do not agree that the\nclauses have that tendency whatever\nthe speculative limits of their misapplication. Clauses 14.2 and 14.3 must be\nread subject to\nclause 14.1. As soon as the default or imperilment which gave\nrise to the enforcement of the rights they provide has been overcome\nthe causa\nfor the retention of the business would fall away and the respondent would be\nobliged to restore the business to the appellant\n(if it has not already been\nlawfully sold or the franchise agreement cancelled). If the respondent were to\nseek improperly to manipulate\nthe powers to draw out its hold on the business\nthe appellant would have its remedies. Of course the likely concomitant of a\nsale\nof the business is a cancellation of the franchise agreement which is the\ntrigger for the assignment or transfer of the lease, the\nclosure of the store\nand the cessation of trading at the location. These are all consequences which\nthe respondent is entitled to\nbring into operation under the franchise\nagreement. They are not under attack. That they exist independently of the bond,\nillustrates\nonce again that the supposedly unhappy results of the exercise of\nthe powers under the bond are in reality no more radical than the\nappellant has\nwillingly and, commercially speaking, fairly exposed itself to without complaint\nunder the contract.\n[28]\tFor these reasons I am satisfied that none of the\nclauses of the bond to which we have been referred possesses the pernicious\ntendencies which would warrant and require the Court to strike them down as\ncontrary to public policy.\n[29]\tIn the result the appeal is dismissed with\ncosts.\nJ A   HEHER\nJUDGE OF\nAPPEAL\nMPATI DP\t\t)Concur\nMARAIS JA\t)\nCAMERON\nJA\t)\nCONRADIE JA\t)",

    "facts": "The Jumbo Trust, trading as OK Foods, joined the Shoprite Checkers franchise in July 2000 and executed a continuing notarial covering bond over its movable assets to secure payments to the franchisor. By September 2001 the Trust owed the respondent about R2.37 million and, despite having stock worth roughly R400,000, refused to allow the respondent to perfect the bond or to hand over possession of the business. The respondent applied ex parte for an interim interdict invoking clause 14 of the bond, which gave it extensive powers to take possession, run the business, draw on bank accounts and sell assets without prior notice. The lower court granted a rule nisi and later confirmed it with conditions. The appeal questioned the validity of those clause‑14 powers, their compatibility with public policy and the Constitution, and whether the debt was established.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the provisions in clause 14 of the notarial bond, which permit parate execution and broad control over the debtor’s business, are contrary to public policy and unconstitutional under s34 and s39 of the Constitution. 2. Whether the creditor must obtain judicial sanction before exercising those powers. 3. Whether the appellant’s indebtedness was established for the purposes of the proceedings. 4. Whether the bond clauses are unconscionable or overly oppressive.",
    "principles": "The court relied on established common‑law rules that parate execution is permissible only if it does not unduly prejudice the debtor’s constitutional right to a fair hearing, and that creditors not in possession must obtain court sanction. Precedents such as Sasfin v Beukes, Osry v Hirsch, Bock & Others v Duburoro Investments and Findevco were considered. The Constitution requires that contractual stipulations, even if wide‑ranging, are upheld provided the debtor retains the ability to seek judicial relief and the terms are not intrinsically contrary to public policy.",
    "application": "The appellate court accepted that the respondent had proved a substantial debt, making the enforcement of the bond relevant. It held that clause 14, while broad, was hedged with conditions that preserve the debtor’s right to approach the court, satisfying constitutional requirements. The creditor had obtained the necessary interdict before taking possession, satisfying the common‑law requirement for judicial sanction. Consequently, there was no need to develop or modify the common law, and the clauses were not found to be unconscionable or contrary to public policy.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The clause‑14 provisions of the notarial bond were upheld, and the interim interdict confirming the respondent’s rights to take possession and enforce the bond remained in force."
