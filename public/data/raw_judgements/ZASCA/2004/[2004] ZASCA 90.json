(âthe complainantâ).\n[2]\nThe accused was convicted in the regional court at Knysna\r\non two counts of rape, one count of abduction and one count of\r\nassault.\nThe matter was thereafter referred to the Cape High Court\r\nfor sentence in terms of s 52 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105\r\nof\n1997 (âthe Actâ). The court\na quo\n(Moosa J) confirmed\r\nthe convictions and sentenced the accused to 5 yearsâ and 3 yearsâ\r\nimprisonment respectively on the two\nrape counts, and to 3 yearsâ\r\nand 3 monthsâ imprisonment respectively for the abduction and the\r\nassault. The sentences were\nordered to run concurrently.\n[3]\nThe State contends that, having regard to the minimum\r\nsentence provisions contained in s 51 of the Act, the sentence\r\nimposed on\nthe accused was too lenient. Sections 51 (1) and 51 (3)\r\n(\na\n) of the Act provide that if a High Court has convicted a\r\nperson of an offence referred to in Part I of Schedule 2, it shall\r\nsentence\nthat person to imprisonment for life unless it is satisfied\r\nthat there are substantial and compelling circumstances which justify\n\nthe imposition of a lesser sentence.\n3\n[4]\nBefore turning to the facts a brief consideration of the\r\nbackground of the accused and the complainant is necessary for a\r\nbetter\nunderstanding of the setting against which the offences were\r\ncommitted. The accused was born at Qumbu in the Transkei, where he\n\nlived according to the traditions, customs and beliefs of his tribe.\r\nAlthough he passed grade seven at school he led a simple and\n\nunsophisticated life. In 1995 he entered into a customary marriage\r\nwith the complainant whom he had known from childhood. She was\nabout\r\n15 years old at the time. They had two children: one who died soon\r\nafter birth and a daughter who was approximately five\nyears old when\r\nthe accused was sentenced. In April 1999 their marriage experienced\r\nproblems which resulted in the complainant leaving\nthe accused to\r\nstay with her brother, Mr S.S.. She assumed that the marriage had\r\nended, not least because the accusedâs uncle\nhad given her\r\npermission to remove her traditional wedding attire. (The accusedâs\r\nfather was deceased, having committed suicide\nsome years previously.)\r\nThe accused on the other hand regarded the marriage as extant,\r\nbecause the\nlobolo\n4\nhe had paid in respect of the complainant had not been returned by\r\nher family.\n5\nIn addition, according to the accused, the two families had not met\r\nto attempt to reconcile the couple, as required by customary\nlaw.\n6\nBoth of these latter two aspects were emphasized by the expert\r\nwitness called by the court, Reverend Ngesi. The accused also\r\nbelieved\nthat the complainantâs family were the cause of the\r\nbreak-up of their marriage. The problems in the marriage arose some\r\ntime\nafter the accused and the complainant had left Transkei for\r\nKnysna, where the accused was working.\n[5]\nI now turn to consider the facts. On Wednesday 12 May 1999\r\nthe accused and the complainant attended the magistrateâs court at\r\nKnysna for the hearing of a child maintenance complaint and a\r\ndomestic violence dispute. At the conclusion of the hearing a\r\ndomestic\nviolence interdict was issued against the accused by\r\nconsent. Upon their return to their respective places of residence\r\nthe accused\npersuaded the complainant to travel with him in the same\r\ntaxi. When she reached her destination he tried to prevent her from\r\ndisembarking\nand begged her to return to his home. She refused and\r\nproceeded to alight from the taxi. He also disembarked. When she ran\r\naway\nsoon after alighting he pursued her and caught up with her near\r\na neighbourâs house. He began to drag her away and a scuffle\r\nensued. As he was trying to pull her towards him she clung on to a\r\npole supporting the neighbourâs boundary fence. Her resistance\ncame\r\nto naught as the pole gave in and was ripped out of the ground. She\r\nthen broke away from him and ran into the neighbourâs\nhouse but he\r\nfollowed and again accosted her. The accused ultimately had his way\r\nand took her to his home by force. He kept her\nthere against her will\r\nfrom Wednesday 12 May until Friday 15 May 1999. During that period he\r\nraped her on six occasions. The complainant\nmanaged to escape on\r\nFriday 15 May, after the accused had left the house for a while.\n[6]\nThe second incident occurred on 29 May 1999. The accused\r\nvisited the complainant at her brotherâs house. He asked to speak\r\nto\nher but the complainantâs brother was only prepared to allow him\r\nto do so if this took place in the house. But shortly after the\n\ncomplainantâs brother had left the house (to fetch his uncle to\r\nhelp him to deal with the accused, who was armed with a knife),\nthe\r\naccused forcibly removed the complainant and dragged her into the\r\nbush to a place near an abandoned abattoir where he raped\nher twice.\r\nOn this occasion he also assaulted the complainant by hitting her\r\ntwice on her thigh with a stick.\n[7]\nHaving\nregard to the minimum sentence provisions,\r\nthe judge\na quo\nfound that âsubstantial and compelling\r\ncircumstancesâ justifying the imposition of a lesser sentence were\r\npresent as contemplated\nby the Act.\n7\nI cannot find any fault with this conclusion. In the appeal before us\r\nthe correctness of this finding was conceded by the State.\n[8]\nIn passing sentence the judge\na quo\ntook into\r\naccount the following factors in aggravation of sentence in relation\r\nto the first incident: the fact that the accused\nhad forced the\r\ncomplainant to accompany him to his home and had held her captive for\r\ntwo days; that he had raped her on six occasions;\nthat he had\r\nthreatened her with a knife and had also threatened to douse her with\r\npetrol and burn her; that the rape took place\nafter the complainant\r\nhad just come from court, where she had obtained a domestic violence\r\ninterdict against him; and that, had\nit not been for the fact that\r\nthe complainant had escaped and reported the matter to the police, he\r\nwould in all probability have\ncontinued with his conduct.\n[9]\nAs to\nthe second incident the judge\na quo\ntook\r\ninto account the fact that the complainant had been forcibly removed\r\nfrom her place of residence; that she had been threatened\nwith a\r\nknife; that the accused had performed certain acts of witchcraft to\r\nfrighten her; that she had been raped twice; that she\nhad been hit\r\nwith a stick; that the accused committed the second rape knowing that\r\nthe police were looking for him; and that he\nmay have continued to\r\nrape and assault the complainant, had he not been interrupted by the\r\ncomplainantâs brother and some elders.\nThe court also noted that\r\nthe accused had shown no remorse.\n[10]\nThe learned judge then had regard to the seriousness of\r\nboth offences and the interests of the community, in particular the\r\ncommunityâs\ndemand for the imposition of heavy sentences on\r\nperpetrators of sexual offences against women.\n[11]\nIn mitigation of sentence the learned judge found that\r\nthe crimes were what he termed âcrimes of passionâ; that the\r\naccused\nhad repeatedly tried to effect a reconciliation with the\r\ncomplainant and had pleaded with her to return to him; that members\r\nof\nthe complainantâs family had possibly contributed to the\r\nbreak-up of the marriage; that the complainant still had âfeelingsâ\n\nfor the accused; that, if the family had left the couple to lead\r\ntheir lives, the problems between them might not have arisen;\nthat\r\nthe complainant had not complained to the accusedâs sister when she\r\narrived at the accusedâs home during the period when\nthe\r\ncomplainant was being held against her will; and that the accused and\r\nthe complainant had different perceptions of whether\nthey were still\r\nmarried to each other or not.\n[12]\nTurning to the personal circumstances of the accused, the\r\nlearned judge noted that the accused was 33 years old; that the\r\ncouple\nhad known each other from childhood and had a five-year old\r\nchild; that the accused left school in grade eight (standard six);\r\nthat he was at the time of the incidents in permanent employment with\r\nMurray and Roberts; that, according to the social worker,\nhe did not\r\nappear to be an aggressive person; that he lived according to\r\ntraditional values and customary practices; and that he\nhad to be\r\ntreated as a first offender as no previous convictions had been\r\nproved against him. Although the accusedâs attorney\ninformed the\r\ncourt from the bar that he had a previous conviction for assault, for\r\nwhich he had been sentenced to nine monthsâ\nimprisonment, no\r\naccount was taken of this â and properly so, as the State did not\r\nseek to prove it.\n8\nThe court was informed further that the complainant in that case was\r\nthe accusedâs sister-in-law whom the accused regarded as\n\ninterfering with his marriage.\n[13]\nAlthough the judge\na quo\ngranted the State leave\r\nto appeal against the sentences on all the counts, argument before us\r\nwas limited to an attack on the propriety\nof the sentences imposed on\r\nthe rape counts. Counsel for the State submitted that the sentence of\r\nfive years for the first rape\ncount was too light and that the second\r\nrape count, for which the accused was only sentenced to three yearsâ\r\nimprisonment, was\nin fact more serious than the first. This was\r\nbecause at that stage the accused knew that he was being sought by\r\nthe police for\nthe first incident. A number of factual misdirections\r\nwere relied upon. First, the learned judgeâs finding that the\r\noffences\nin question were âcrimes of passionâ was attacked. In my\r\nview this finding is, with respect, not correct as the offences were\n\nnot committed without rational reflection whilst the perpetrator was\r\ninfluenced by barely controllable emotion, which is an essential\n\ncharacteristic of a crime of passion. Secondly, the finding that the\r\ncomplainant still had âfeelingsâ for the accused was correctly\n\nattacked because the complainant had made it clear to the accused\r\nthat she did not want to have anything further to do with him\nand had\r\nin fact left him.  A third misdirection, so counsel for the State\r\nsubmitted, was the learned judgeâs reliance â as\na mitigating\r\nfactor - on the complainantâs failure to report the rape to the\r\naccusedâs sister, when the latter had arrived\nat the house where\r\nthe complainant was being held captive. Counsel reminded us that in\r\nher evidence the complainant had given a\nplausible explanation for\r\nher failure to report - she said that the sister had previously been\r\nantagonistic towards her and would\nnot have been sympathetic to her\r\nplight - and this explanation appears to have been overlooked by the\r\njudge\na quo.\n[14]\nI agree that the court\na quo\ndid indeed misdirect\r\nitself in the respects set out above, and that the misdirections are\r\nmaterial, so entitling this court to interfere\nwith the sentence\r\nimposed. The circumstances in which a court of appeal is entitled to\r\ninterfere with sentence were encapsulated\nby Marais JA in\nS v\r\nMalgas\nas follows:\nâ\nA court exercising appellate jurisdiction cannot, in\r\nthe absence of material misdirection by the trial court, approach the\r\nquestion\nof sentence as if it were the trial court and then\r\nsubstitute the sentence arrived at by it simply because it prefers\r\nit. To do\nso would be to usurp the sentencing discretion of the trial\r\ncourt. Where material misdirection by the trial court vitiates its\r\nexercise of that discretion, an appellate court is of course entitled\r\nto consider the question of sentence afresh. In doing so,\nit assesses\r\nsentence as if it were a Court of first instance and the sentence\r\nimposed by the trial court has no relevance. As it\nis said, an\r\nappellate Court is at large. However, even in the absence of material\r\nmisdirection, an appellate court may yet be justified\nin interfering\r\nwith the sentence imposed by the trial court. It may do so when the\r\ndisparity between the sentence of the trial\ncourt and the sentence\r\nwhich the appellate court would have imposed had it been the trial\r\ncourt is so marked that it can properly\nbe described as âshockingâ,\r\nâstartlingâ or âdisturbingly inappropriateââ.\n9\n[15]\nI am also satisfied that the sentences imposed in respect\r\nof the two rape counts were so disturbingly inappropriate as to lead\r\nto\nthe inference that the judge\na quo\nfailed to exercise his\r\ndiscretion properly. As already indicated I agree with the finding of\r\nthe court\na quo\nthat there were substantial and compelling\r\ncircumstances\nin casu\njustifying the imposition of a lesser\r\nsentence than life imprisonment. The complainant and the accused were\r\nnot strangers to each\nother. They had lived together as husband and\r\nwife in a customary marriage relationship for a number of years\r\nbefore the rapes.\nThere was no evidence that the complainant suffered\r\nany lasting psychological trauma to speak of, although she did\r\nmention in her\nevidence that she still thought about the incidents.\r\nShe only suffered minor injuries. In fact, at the time sentence was\r\nconsidered,\nthe complainant could not be found and gave no evidence\r\nin aggravation of sentence. While rape is undoubtedly a very serious\r\noffence,\nI am not convinced that this is a case, despite the\r\nprovisions of the Act, which requires the maximum sentence which can\r\nbe imposed\nby a court. In this regard the remarks of Cameron JA in\nS\r\nv Abrahams\n, a case which concerned the imposition of the minimum\r\nsentences prescribed by the Act, are both instructive and apposite:\nââ¦\nrape can [n]ever be condoned. But some rapes are\r\nworse than others, and the life sentence ordained by the Legislature\r\nshould be\nreserved for cases devoid of substantial factors compelling\r\nthe conclusion that such a sentence is inappropriate and unjust.â\n10\n[16]\nAs stated earlier in the judgment the accused believed\r\nthat he and the complainant were still married at the time of the\r\nincidents.\nHaving regard to the evidence of Reverend Ngesi, it would\r\nappear at the time of the offence that the couple were indeed in all\r\nprobability still formally married under customary law. It is clear\r\nfrom his evidence that at the time of the incidents the accused\n\nhonestly (albeit entirely misguidedly) believed that he had some\r\nârightâ to conjugal benefits. His actions, though totally\n\nunacceptable in law, might well be (albeit only to a limited extent)\r\nexplicable given his background. He grew up and lived in a\nworld of\r\nhis own, of tradition and Black medicine â which was not completely\r\nstrange to the complainant (they grew up together\nand come from the\r\nsame area). His actions were shaped and moulded by the norms, beliefs\r\nand customary practices by which he lived\nhis life. Though the rapes\r\nwere accompanied by some acts or threats of violence, it does not\r\nappear that the prime objective was\nto do the complainant harm. The\r\nkey aim, it seems, was to subjugate the complainant to his will and\r\nto persuade her to return to\nhim â a consequence of male\r\nchauvinism, perhaps associated with traditional customary practices.\r\nThat these traits or habits\nare difficult to discard appears to have\r\nbeen true of the accused. The complainantâs rights to bodily\r\nintegrity and dignity and\nher entitlement to have these rights\r\nrespected and protected\n11\nwere not foremost amongst his concerns. These ingrained traits and\r\nhabits of the accused cannot be ignored when considering an\n\nappropriate sentence. He wanted the complainant back home, as his\r\nwife - in one piece. The threats he made were empty, albeit designed\n\nto frighten her.\n[17]\nThese factors perforce have to be weighed up against the\r\nbenchmark provided by the legislature for offences of this type. In\r\nimposing\nthe sentences of 5 yearsâ and 3 yearsâ imprisonment for\r\nthe two rapes (eight incidents) it would appear that the judge\na\r\nquo\nreasoned, erroneously, that having found substantial and\r\ncompelling circumstances to be present, he considered himself to have\r\na\nfree and unfettered discretion to impose any sentence he considered\r\nappropriate. In so doing, he appears to have overlooked the\nbenchmark\r\nindicating the seriousness with which the Legislature views offences\r\nof this type. This approach amounts to a material\nmisdirection. It is\r\nas well to recall what Marais JA said in\nMalgas\n. Dealing with\r\ndeparture from the prescribed minimum sentence provisions prescribed\r\nby the Act the learned judge said:\nâ\nWhat stands out quite clearly is that the courts are\r\na good deal freer to depart from the prescribed sentences than has\r\nbeen supposed\nin some of the previously decided cases and that it is\r\nthey who are to judge whether or not the circumstances of any\r\nparticular\ncase are such as to justify a departure. However, in doing\r\nso, they are to respect, and not merely pay lip service to, the\r\nLegislatureâs\nview that the prescribed periods of imprisonment are\r\nto be taken to be ordinarily appropriate when crimes of the specified\r\nkind\nare committed.â\nMarais JA continued:\nâ\nIf the sentencing court on consideration of the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case is satisfied that they render\r\nthe prescribed\nsentence unjust in that it would be disproportionate\r\nto the crime, the criminal and the needs of society, so that an\r\ninjustice\nwould be done by imposing that sentence, it is entitled to\r\nimpose a lesser sentence.\nIn so doing, account must be taken of the fact that\r\ncrime of that particular kind has been singled out for severe\r\npunishment and\nthat the sentence to be imposed in lieu of the\r\nprescribed sentence should be assessed\npaying\r\ndue regard to the bench mark which the Legislature has providedâ.\n12\n(Emphasis added.)\nIn\nS v Abrahams\n,\nCameron JA put it thus:\nâ\nThe prescribed sentences the Act contains play a dual\r\nrole in the sentencing process. Where factors of substance do not\r\ncompel the\nconclusion that the application of the prescribed sentence\r\nwould be unjust, that sentence must be imposed. However, even where\r\nsuch factors are present, the sentences the Act prescribes create a\r\nlegislative standard that weighs upon the sentencing courtâs\n\ndiscretion. This entails sentences for the scheduled crimes that are\r\nconsistently heavier than before.â\n13\n[18]\nIn my view even in the absence of misdirection this court\r\nwould have been entitled to intervene, given that the sentences\r\nimposed\nin respect of the rape counts were disturbingly\r\ninappropriate. I am satisfied that on both of the bases indicated in\nMalgas\nin the passages quoted in para [14] above, this court\r\nis entitled to reconsider the sentence. The crimes committed by the\r\naccused\nwere undoubtedly serious and the legislature has provided a\r\nbenchmark which must be borne in mind at all times. Giving due weight\n\nto the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and to the special\r\ncircumstances of this case as set out above and bearing in mind\nthat,\r\nwhen sentence was passed, the accused had already been in custody for\r\nmore than three and half years, an appropriate sentence\nis, in my\r\nview, ten years in respect of each of the two counts of rape, such\r\nsentences to run concurrently with each other and\nwith the sentences\r\nimposed for the other offences.\n[19]\nThe appeal accordingly succeeds. The sentences imposed by\r\nthe court\na quo\nare set aside and are replaced by the\r\nfollowing sentences:\nCount 1:\tRape: 10 yearsâ imprisonment;\nCount 2:\tAbduction: 3 yearsâ imprisonment;\nCount 3:\tRape: 10 yearsâ imprisonment;\nCount 4:\tAssault: 3 monthsâ imprisonment.\nThe sentences on counts 2, 3 and 4 are to run concurrently with each\r\nother and with the sentence on count 1. To the extent necessary,\nthe\r\nsentences are antedated in terms of\ns 282\nof the\nCriminal Procedure\nAct 51 of 1977\nto 7 November 2002, being the date upon which the\r\nsentences were imposed.\n__________________\nKK MTHIYANE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCONCUR:\nCLOETE \t\tJA\nVAN HEERDEN\tJA\n1\nS v Toms; S v Bruce\n[1990] ZASCA 38\n;\n1990\r\n\t(2) SA 802\n(A) at 806 H-I.\n2\n2\nSee\ns 51\nof, read with\nSchedule 2 to, the\nCriminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997\nfor a description of the\r\n\toffences concerned.\n3\nSee, in this regard,\nS v Malgas\n2001\r\n\t(1) SACR 469\n(SCA) para 25.\n4\nLobolo\nis\r\n\tconsideration paid by the bridegroom to the family of the bride\r\n\tbefore the marriage.

    "facts": "Khehlani Mvamvu, a 33‑year‑old man from the Transkei, was in a customary marriage with Ms C.S., who was about 15 years old when they married in 1995. In May 1999, after a domestic‑violence interdict had been issued against him, Mvamvu abducted the complainant, held her captive for two days and raped her six times. He later forced her from her brother's house, dragged her into the bush and raped her twice more, also assaulting her with a stick. The regional court convicted him of two counts of rape, one count of abduction and one count of assault.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was whether the sentencing court correctly departed from the statutory minimum of life imprisonment for rape prescribed in section 51 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997, or whether the imposed five‑year and three‑year sentences were unreasonably lenient. The court also had to consider whether substantial and compelling circumstances justified a lesser sentence and whether any material misdirection affected the sentencing discretion.",
    "principles": "Section 51(1) and 51(3)(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act mandate life imprisonment for rape unless substantial and compelling circumstances exist. Courts must balance this legislative benchmark with the individualised factors of the offender, guided by precedents such as S v Malgas (appellate interference where misdirection or a shocking sentence occurs) and S v Abrahams (life sentences reserved for the most grave cases). Constitutional principles of proportionality and the need for individualized punishment also apply.",
    "application": "The appeal court examined the background of the accused – limited education, customary marriage expectations, and lack of prior convictions – and acknowledged substantial and compelling circumstances. However, it found material misdirections in the trial judge's reasoning, particularly the characterisation of the offences as \"crimes of passion\" and the undervaluation of aggravating factors. Concluding that the original sentences were disturbingly inappropriate, the court applied the legislative benchmark and imposed ten‑year sentences for each rape, to run concurrently with the abduction and assault sentences, antedated to 7 November 2002.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The original sentences were set aside and replaced with the following orders: Count 1 – rape, 10 years' imprisonment; Count 2 – abduction, 3 years' imprisonment; Count 3 – rape, 10 years' imprisonment; Count 4 – assault, 3 months' imprisonment. The sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4 run concurrently with each other and with the sentence on count 1, and are antedated to 7 November 2002."
