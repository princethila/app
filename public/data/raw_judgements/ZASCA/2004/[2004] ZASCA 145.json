When he\nappeared in the magistrateâs court and during proceedings in\nterms\nof s 119 and s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\n(âthe Actâ and âthe s 119 plea proceedingsâ)\nhe pleaded\nguilty. Questioned in terms of s 121(1) he explained that the\nmurder was premeditated and how it was executed. However,\nat his\ntrial in the Transvaal Provincial Division (âthe court\na quo\nâ)\nthe respondent pleaded not guilty. The court\na quo\nheld that\nthe respondentâs fundamental rights had been violated and ruled\nthat evidence of a confession and pointing out and of\nthe s 119\nplea proceedings be excluded by virtue of the provisions of s 35(5)\nof the Constitution. At the close of the\nstateâs case and in the\nabsence of any evidence implicating the respondent the court\na quo\nacquitted him. The state thereupon applied in terms of s 319 of\nthe Act for the reservation of several questions for the\nconsideration\nof this court. The court\na quo\nrefused the\napplication but a subsequent application to this court was referred\nto us for oral argument. At the same time, the parties\nwere advised\nthat they should be prepared, if called upon to do so, to address us\non the merits of the appeal.\n[2]\tImmediately after the s 119 plea proceedings the respondent\napplied to be released on bail. The application was refused\nas was a\nsubsequent application to the court\na quo\nand an appeal to\nthis court. In terms of s 60(11B)\n(c)\nof the Act the\nrecord of the bail proceedings (âthe bail recordâ), excluding\ncertain parts not presently relevant, formed part\nof the record of\nthe trial. The following documents were handed in during the bail\napplication:\nA document headed âAantekening van Uitwysing van Toneel (Tonele\n\ten/of Punt(e))â. This document consists of 4 pages (âthe\nmain\n\tdocumentâ) plus an annexure (âthe annexureâ) numbered pages 5\n\tand 6. A confession is annexed to this document. The annexure\n\tpurports to be signed by a Senior Superintendent E Viljoen at 13h40\n\ton 29 August 2001. According to it the respondent was informed\nof\n\this right to a legal practitioner, that he was not obliged to make a\n\tconfession or an admission and of various other rights.\nIn the main\n\tdocument it is recorded that the respondent appeared before Viljoen\n\tat 13h44 on 29 August 2001; that he was warned\nthat âhy nie\n\tverplig is om enige toneel (tonele) en/of punt(e) op die toneel\n\t(tonele) aan te wys of om enigiets daaromtrent te\nsÃª nieâ and\n\tthat he was informed of various other rights. It is further recorded\n\tthat the respondent stated that he understood\nwhat his rights were\n\tand that he nevertheless wished to point out âdie toneelâ. It is\n\talso recorded that the respondent and\nViljoen departed at 14h17 and\n\treturned at 15h40. The confession purports to have been signed at\n\t16h00 on 29 August 2001.\nA âNotice of Rights in terms of the Consitutionâ which purports\n\tto be signed by the respondent and an Inspector van Rensburg\nat\n\t17h25 at 29 August 2001. According to this document the respondent\n\twas told that he had various rights inter alia âthe right\nto\n\tconsult with a legal practitioner of (his) choice or, should (he) so\n\tprefer, to apply to the Legal Aid board to be provided\nby the State\n\twith the services of a legal practitionerâ and âthe right to\n\tremain silentâ.\nA âWaarskuwingsverklaring deur Verdagteâ which purports to be\n\tsigned by the respondent and a Captain Fabricius. According to\nthis\n\tdocument the respondent was told at 11h05 on 30 Augustus 2001 why he\n\thad been arrested and also that he had a right to remain\nsilent and\n\tto consult a legal practioner of his choice or that he could apply\n\tto be provided with the services of a legal practitioner\nat the\n\tstateâs expense.\n[3]\tAt the trial the state tendered the evidence of four witnesses\nnone of whom implicated the respondent. The state then requested\nthat\na trial within a trial be held in order to determine whether the\nconfession and pointing out, which formed part of the bail\nrecord,\nhad been made freely and voluntarily and at the same time to\ndetermine whether the respondent acted freely and voluntarily\nduring\nthe s 119 plea proceedings. At that stage Mr Wagenaar, an\nattorney who represented the respondent, was in agreement that\nthe\nmatter should proceed by way of a trial within a trial. However, a\ndiscussion which covered 26 pages of the record, ensued between\nthe\njudge\na quo\nand the parties. In order to properly understand\nthe stateâs complaints against the exclusion by the court\na quo\nof evidence of the confession and plea proceedings it is necessary to\nrefer in some detail to what was said during the discussion.\n[4]\tWagenaar indicated that there would be a legal argument to the\neffect that the presiding officer at the s 119 proceedings\nhad\nnot adhered to the prescribed requirements. Asked by the court\na\nquo\nwhether the respondent had been advised of his right to legal\nrepresentation he replied that that was going to be a 'massive issue'\nat the trial within a trial. Counsel for the state, Mr Mosing,\nindicated that the state contended that the respondent had been told\nof his right to legal representation. Wagenaar proceeded to insinuate\nin very vague terms that other irregularities were committed\nduring\nthe s 119 plea proceedings and during the bail application in\nthe magistrateâs court to which the judge\na quo\nresponded:\nâYes I know where you are getting to I think I am beginning to read\nyour mind.â Precisely what the judge\na quo\nwas reading into\nthe insinuations he did not say.\n[5]\tAsked to state in a nutshell what the respondentâs objection\nwas Wagenaar stated: âI am objecting to the state presenting\nstatements by the accused whether in or outside any court to be\nallowed.â\n[6]\tMosing then suggested:\nâ\nMâLord the issue of the plea proceedings it also\nmay be a subject of a trial-within-a-trial. As I have indicated\nearlier, my understanding\nwas it could be conducted in one\ntrial-within-a-trial, only as far as the voluntariness and the sound\nand sober senses of the accused.\nThe other issues MâLord which has\nnow been pointed out, perhaps in the light thereof, it would be\nfeasible to have a separate trial-within-a-trial\nfor the plea\nproceedings.â\n[7]\tThe court\na quo\ninterpreted the objection by the\nrespondent to be an objection to the court\na quo\nproceeding\nwith a trial within a trial. Thereupon the following interchange\nbetween Mosing and the judge\na quo\nfollowed:\nâ\nMR MOSING\n:  I do not\nunderstand that it has been opposed M'Lord, I am sorry.\nCOURT\n: He objected, it is\nobjected, right there has been an objection.\nMR MOSING\n: The objection is\nto the admissibility of that statement made by the accused, but it\nhas got to be tested in a trial-within-a-trial\nM'Lord if the state is\nproceeding with it.\nCOURT\n: No what I have\nrecorded here is an objection by the defence right. The objection of\nthe defence raise various issues. I will not\nskirt around it, and say\nright lets plunge into a trial-within-a-trial, but to give the\ndefence a fair opportunity I will consider\nthe objection. Then to\nrule accordingly I am not simply going to capitulate the rights of\nthis court to the prosecuting authority.\nThere is an objection and I\nhave to deal with it.\nMR MOSING\n: Yes M'Lord.\nCOURT\n: In as much as it may\nbe necessary to have the trial-within-a-trial, but I have to hear and\nit is a fundamental principle of natural\nrule,\naudi\nalteram partem\n. I have to hear to the\nobjection which is the reason why I listen to him. But to plunge into\na trial-within-a-trial would be easiest\nway, but I have to accord the\ndefence their right to be heard in this court.\n. . .\nThere is an objection and I will deal with it tomorrow\nmorning. If either of you have any authorities to support your\nproposition\nyou can raise it with me tomorrow.â\n[8]\tMy understanding of the position emerging from a discussion that\nmust have lasted more than an hour is that the respondent objected\nto\nthe admissibility of the statement and pointing out as well as the\nplea proceedings; the state wanted to resolve the issue by\nway of a\ntrial within a trial; the respondent had no objection to proceeding\nwith a trial within a trial but the judge\na quo\ninsisted that\nthere was an objection by the respondent to proceeding with a trial\nwithin a trial.\n[9]\tIn the light of the judge\na quo\nâs attitude, one would\nhave thought that the argument was going to be whether the\nadmissibility of the statement and pointing out\nand the plea\nproceedings should be determined by way of a trial within a trial.\nHowever, the next day the judge\na quo\nopened the proceedings\nas follows:\nâ\nSince the objection is taken by Mr Wagenaar I will\ngive him the first opportunity to address the court. I understand\nthat he will\nbe citing various authorities as well.\nIf I may crystallise very briefly from yesterday. The\nstate contended that it would conduct the trial-within-a-trial,\nregarding the\nstatement made by the accused, as well as the pointing\nout as one component and then to deal with the plea proceeding.\nWhereas on\nthe other hand Mr Wagenaarâs objection, if the court\nunderstand it correctly, was simply that a trial within a trial\nshould be\na single exercise bringing the two components the first,\nthat is the statement made by the accused and pointing out, together\nwith\nthe plea proceedings, because the defence regards that as one\nprocess.\nThis brings to the point that there are two different\npositions taken by the two sides in this matter. Therefore in\nfairness to the\naccused, in the interest of justice, the court will\ndeal with this aspect in some detail to listen to argument.â\n[10]\tUnfortunately, the statement intended to crystallise what had\nhappened the previous day could only have served to confuse the\nissue\nfurther. The state never contended that the statement and the plea\nproceedings should be dealt with in different compartments.\nIt\naccepted that the question whether the confession and the statements\nby the respondent during the plea proceedings were made voluntarily\nshould be dealt with in one trial within a trial. Any legal argument\nin respect of the plea proceedings could be dealt with afterwards.\nWhen the state learned that there were other objections to the plea\nproceedings based on speculative facts it tentatively suggested\nthat\nâperhaps in the light thereof, it would be feasible to have a\nseparate trial within a trial for the plea proceedings.â It\ndid not\nindicate that it was averse to one trial within a trial to determine\nall relevant facts relating to the admissibility of\nthe statement and\nthe plea proceedings.\n[11]\tThe respondent was also not under the impression that the state\ncontended that the statement and plea proceedings had to be\ndealt\nwith separately. Wagenaar commenced his argument as follows:\nâ\n[I]n my learned colleagueâs address to the court\nabout what the next process will be, he . . . indicated that there is\na confession,\na statement appearing to be a confession, certain\npointing outs and then a plea of guilty in the lower court. . . .\nthat in itself\nindicates, . . . that it involves one process. With\nrespect MâLord I agree with my learned colleague that these\nentities involve\none process.â\n[12]\tIn these circumstances there must have been utter confusion in\nthe minds of the legal respresentatives as to what it was the\njudge\na\nquo\nwanted to hear argument about.\n[13]\tWagenaar nevertheless proceeded to address the court. His\naddress lasted more than a day and covers 106 pages of the record.\nSurprisingly, in the light of his earlier attitude, he argued that if\nthe admissibility of the s 119 proceedings is contested\non the\nbasis of duress the matter must be dealt with by means of a trial\nwithin a trial but if it is contested on the basis of a\nviolation of\nthe accusedâs fundamental human rights one first had to deal with\nthe latter question. If there had been such a violation\nthere was no\nneed for a trial within a trial, so he submitted. He then proceeded\nto deal with the question whether there had been\na violation of the\nrespondentâs fundamental human rights. In this regard he submitted\nby reference to the record of the s 119\nplea proceedings, which\ndoes not purport to be a verbatim record, that the respondent had not\nbeen advised of his right to further\nparticulars before he was\nrequired to plead; that he was not advised of his right to remain\nsilent during the pleading process; and,\nwhat he considered to be\nâthe most crucial infringementâ, that the magistrate failed to\ninvestigate âthe whole aspect of legal\nrepresentationâ.\n[14]\tAt this stage of the proceedings the judge\na quo\nsaid:\nâ\n[Y]ou have alluded to 35(3) but I also want you to\nlook at 35(1) and 35(2). Iâm not going to identify the relevant . .\n. paragraphs\nof 35(1) and 35(2) for you, I think during the lunch\nadjournment you could go through it because prior to the moment of\nthe accusedâs\nplea he was an arrested person, he was a detained\nperson, and I would like you to address me on any aspects of any of\nhis rights\nwere infringed . . .â\nThe judge\na quo\nwas thus saying to Wagenaar that he had\naddressed him on the rights of an accused during a trial but that he\nshould check whether\nthere had not also been violations of the\naccusedâs rights in terms of s 35(1) and (2) of the\nConstitution. These sections\ndeal with the rights of an arrested\nperson and a detained person respectively.\n[15]\tAfter an adjournment Wagenaar, having been prompted to do so by\nthe court\na quo\n, proceeded to argue that the respondentâs\nfundamental rights in terms of s 35(1) and 35(2) had been\nbreached. He once again\nstressed that, before entering into a trial\nwithin a trial, one should first determine whether there had been an\ninfringement of\nthe accusedâs fundamental rights. If there had been\nsuch an infringement there was no need to have a trial within a\ntrial. âA\ntrial within a trial deals with the requirements of\nsection 217. Was it freely and voluntary, while he was at his sober\nsensesâ\nhe submitted. He then proceeded to draw factual inferences\nfrom documents forming part of the bail record. In this regard he\nstated\nâwe are dealing with documents and what I am arguing now can\nbe determined from documentsâ.\n[16]\tAt the end of Wagenaarâs argument the court\na quo\nsummarised it as follows:\nâ\nSo you basically say to the court that on the basis\nof the legal argument, on the documentation before the court the\nevidence that\nthe state intents to tender, by way of a\ntrial-within-a-trial regarding the confession as well as the pointing\nout and the plea ought\nnot to be admitted.â\n[17]\tMosing submitted that even where there was an allegation of a\nbreach of fundamental rights in respect of evidence obtained by\nthe\nstate, it was incumbent on the court\na quo\nto establish: (a)\nwhether the evidence had indeed been obtained as a result of a breach\nof fundamental rights of the accused; and\n(b) whether the admission\nof such evidence would render the trial unfair or would be\ndetrimental to the administration of justice.\nThat, so he submitted,\ncould only be done by reference to all the relevant facts and\ncircumstances.\n[18]\tIn his heads of argument in the court\na quo\nMosing\nsubmitted:\nâ\nThe state should be allowed opportunity to rebut or\nreply before the court makes a ruling on the admissibility of the\nevidenceâ\n.\nThe court\na quo\nreacted to this submission as follows:\nâ\nCOURT\n: At this stage the\ncourt is not engaged firstly on the admissibility of evidence. . . .\n. . .\nMR MOSING\n: MâLord that is\nthe way I have understood the effect of the objection.\nCOURT:\nYou have constantly\nand continuously harped on the issue of the trial within a trial. The\ntrial within a trial that determines the\nadmissibility of the\nevidence, this submission of yours is totally misleading, it is a\nmis-statement. One does not expect counsel\nof your standing from the\ndirector of public prosecutionâs office to make such a submission\nbecause you have constantly harped\non a trial within a trial. The\npurpose of a trial within a trial is to determine the admissibility\nof evidence which is in the form\nof a confession, is that correct?\nMR MOSING\n: MâLord also . .\n. (intervenes).\nCOURT\n: This court at this\nstage is engaged in determining whether there has been an\ninfringement of the accusedâs rights or not. If such\ninfringement\nhad occurred what are the consequences thereof and what its impact on\nthe trial within a trial. It seems either deliberately\nyou have\nmisunderstood the position and this submission is extremely\nmisleading and if it is the intent to mislead the court then\nI\ncertainly take exception.\nMR MOSING\n: No it is not the\nintent to mislead the court.\nCOURT\n: Well the other point I\nwant to take with you,\nâ\nThe state should be allowed opportunity to rebut or\nreply.â\n. . .\nMR MOSING\n: Yes MâLord, on\nlegal grounds I have . . . (intervenes).\nCOURT\n: You have made\nsubmissions.\nMR MOSING\n: On the procedure\nyes.\nCOURT\n: On the arguments that\nwere raised by â well let us put it this way, an objection was\nraised by Mr Wagenaar, he supported his objections\nby way of certain\ncontentions followed with submissions backed by authorities. Have you\nbeen given a fair and an equal opportunity\nto rebut the fact in\nargument?\nMR MOSING\n: Yes indeed my\nlord.\nCOURT\n: Let us be very clearly\nunderstood here. Do you have any further submissions?\nMR MOSING\n: No further\nsubmissions MâLord.â\n[19]\tThe crititicism of Mosing was totally unwarranted. He made a\nvaliant but unsuccessful effort to persuade the judge\na quo\nof\nan elementary proposition, namely, that a factual issue cannot be\ndecided by way of argument. If anything he is to be commended\nfor the\nmanner in which he dealt with this criticism and other unwarranted\ncriticisms levelled against him by the judge\na quo\n.\n[20]\tThe statement by the judge\na quo\nthat the court was not\ndealing with the admissibility of evidence is perhaps the most\nbewildering aspect of the whole saga. In his\njudgment, after some\nfour days of argument, the judge\na quo\nsaid that he was of the\nview that the admissibility of statements by an accused had to be\ndealt with independently from allegations\nof any infringement or\nviolation of his constitutional rights. He considered it to be\naxiomatic that once an infringement or infraction\nof the accusedâs\nrights under section 35(1), 35(2) and (3) of the Constitution had\nbeen raised by way of an objection during the\ncourse of a trial, the\ncourt by virtue of section 38 read with section 8(1) and (2) was\nbound to determine that issue first. He expressed\nthe view that a\nchaotic situation would arise if the determination of a breach of\nconstitutional rights were conflated with the determination\nof the\nadmissibility of a confession and pointing out at a trial within a\ntrial and said:\nâ\nFirst and foremost, the accused has a right to know\nif his constitutional rights were violated and any evidence that was\nprocured\nin violation of his right is to be excluded or not under\nsection 35(5). That constitutional imperative has precedence over a\ntrial\nwithin a trial as contemplated within the ambit of section 217\nof the Criminal Code.â\nReferring to Mosingâs submission that the court should not decide\nthe issue without first hearing evidence and establishing the\nfacts\nhe held:\nâ\nIn the absence of any procedure rules, once an\nobjection to the admissibility of evidence is raised on the basis of\na violation of\nconstitutional right whilst being an arrestee,\ndetainee or an accused, then the trial judge has a discretion to deal\nwith the objection\nby adjudicating on the fundamental rights issues\nraised.â\n. . .\nâ\nTherefore, the objection raised by Mr Wagenaar, upon\nthe prosecutionâs announcement to proceed with the trial within the\ntrial,\nhas merit and needed to be considered first rather than having\nthe rights issue determined within a trial within a trial.â\n[21]\tThis statement by the judge\na quo\nis of interest for two\nreasons: First, having criticised Mosing for dealing with the issue\nas one of admissibility he now recognised\nthat he was dealing with a\nquestion of admissibility. Second, the judge\na quo\nstill did\nnot grasp the trite proposition that he was faced with a factual\ndispute, the resolution of which required the hearing\nof evidence.\n[22]\tThe judge\na quo\nproceeded to refer to the fact that the\nbail record  formed part of the record of the trial and said:\nâ\nMr Mosing, on behalf of the State, was in a position\nto have assailed or even elucidated on any of the evidence contained\nin those\ndocuments by raising a counter objection and/or applying to\ntender evidence either by way of affidavits or orally from the police\nofficers concerned as well as from the prosecutor and the magistrate\nin the lower court. The prosecution elected not to launch a\nfull\nscale counter-attack and was quite content in rebutting by way of\nargument.â\nHow the judge\na quo\ncould have said this, having stated,\nshortly before, that Mosing argued that the court should not decide\nthe issue without first\nhearing evidence and establishing the facts,\nis difficult to comprehend. The reference to a counter objection is\nin itself cause\nfor further bewilderment.\n[23]\tReferring to s 35(3)(f), (h) and (g) the judge\na quo\nconcluded:\nâ\nThus, the right to legal representation and the right\nto silence form the bedrock to universally accepted values and our\ndemocracy\nnot only subscribes but enshrines these values in the\nConstitution.â\nIn respect of the s 119 plea proceedings he held that in the\nabsence of any recordal in the record of those proceedings that\nthe\nrespondent was informed of his right to remain silent the only\nreasonable and probable inference was that the magistrate failed\nto\ninform him of his right to remain silent during the proceedings. In\ndoing so he treated factual statements in documents forming\npart of\nthe bail record as evidence and drew factual inferences from those\ndocuments.\n[24]\tThe judge\na quo\nfollowed the same approach in respect of\nthe confession. The fact that the âWaarskuwingsverklaringâ was\nmade one day after the\nrespondent had been arrested and detained was\nconsidered by him to be the âmost disquietening and disturbingâ\naspect of the case.\nHe stated that the accused was according to that\ndocument informed of his rights in terms of the Constitution at 17h25\nie âafter\nthe pointing out which took place between 14h17 and\n15h40â. Ignoring the statements to the contrary in the other\ndocuments he concluded:\nâ\nThe only reasonable and probable inference that can\nbe drawn is that the accused was made to point out and confess first\nwithout having\nbeen informed of his rights and thereafter an attempt\nwas made by the police to regularise the process by duly informing\nhim of his\nsection 35(1) and 35(2) rights.'\n[25]\tOne of the two pages of the annexure and two of the six pages of\nthe âwaarskuwingsverklaringâ do not bear the signature,\ninitials\nor thumbprints of the respondent. Without having heard evidence in\nthis regard the judge\na quo\nsaid: âThe reasonable possible\ninference is that these pages were inserted at some stage without the\npossible knowledge of the\naccused. Inferentially it is indicative of\nregularising the process\nex post facto\n.â\n[26]\tThe judge\na quo\nconcluded that the plea of guilty in the\nlower court and the confession and pointing out had been obtained in\nviolation of the respondentâs\nfundamental rights and that to admit\nevidence thereof would render the trial unfair and would be\ndetrimental to the administration\nof justice. He accordingly ruled\nthat the evidence be excluded in terms of s 35(5) of the\nConstitution.\n[27]\tAfter the court\na quo\nâs ruling Mosing once again\naddressed the court. He stated that there might have been a\nmisunderstanding. He said that he had understood\nthe position to be\nthat the court was dealing with the procedure to be followed and that\nit had been his intention to lead evidence\non the aspects mentioned\nby the court\na quo\nin its judgment. He stated that it was\npossible for the state to elaborate on the documents referred to by\nthe judge\na quo\nby way of further evidence and submitted that\nthe state should be allowed to present the evidence of inter alia\nViljoen and the investigating\nofficer. Once again he tried to\npersuade the court\na quo\nthat the factual dispute between the\nparties could only be resolved by way of evidence. At one stage,\nduring an interchange between\nMosing and the judge\na quo\n, the\njudge\na quo\nreacting to a statement that the court\na quo\nnever indicated that the state could present\nviva voce\nevidence, the judge\na quo\nsaid:\nâ\n[T]he court is not here to be counsel, to advise the\nparties. The court indicated it would listen to argument legal\nargument, factual\nargument, it was prepared to do that.â\n[28]\tThe court\na quo\neventually dismissed the stateâs\napplication. It held that the application by the state was an attempt\nto proceed with a trial\nwithin a trial through the back door and that\nto allow the state to lead the evidence after a ruling had been given\nwould be subverting\nthe respondentâs right to a fair trial. Mosing\nthen closed the stateâs case whereupon the respondent was\nacquitted.\n[29]\tThe only manner by which the state can appeal against the\njudgment by the court\na quo\nis by way of the reservation of\nquestions of law for the consideration of this court in terms of\ns 319 of the Act. The state\napplied to the court\na quo\nfor the reservation of several questions but the application was\ndismissed. One of the questions was: âIs\nS v De Vries\n1989\n(1) SA 228\nAD authority for and/or is there a constitutional\ninjunction for the proposition that objections based on infringement\nof s 35(1)(a),\n(b), (c) and 35(3)(h) and (j) rights be\ndetermined first and independently from those contained in s 217\nof Act 51 of 1977 (i.e.\nvoluntariness etc.).â The judge\na quo\nconsidered this to be the core question to which all the other\nquestions were intrinsically related. He held that the crucial\nquestion\nwas whether evidence of the confession and pointing out\nshould be excluded because of a violation of fundamental rights. He\nreasoned\nthat whether there had been such a violation âwas\nessentially a factual inquiry based on the record, which constituted\nevidence,\nthat was placed before the Court by the prosecutorâ.\nThus, he said âthe exclusion of evidence in the form of an\naccusedâs confession\nand pointing out statement was a question of\nfact rather than a question of lawâ. He concluded: âThat being\nso, in my considered\nopinion, the possibility of that evidence being\naltered is so remote that it will be an unreasonable exercise of the\ndiscretion to\nallow the catena of questions that the applicant seeks\nto reserve. The other questions which are also sought to be reserved\nare so\nintrinsically intertwined that they do not warrant\nconsideration.â In his view the respondent was âseeking to create\na right\nof appeal on the facts against the respondentâs acquittalâ.\n[30]\tThe judge\na quo\nwas quite correct in holding that whether\nthere had been a violation of fundamental rights was essentially a\nfactual enquiry but\nthat was not the question which he was asked to\nreserve. He never dealt with the question which he considered to be\nthe core question.\n[31]\tAs stated above a subsequent application to this court for the\nreservation of questions of law was referred to us for argument\nand\nthe parties were advised that they should be prepared to address the\ncourt on the merits.\n[32]\tDuring argument before us the questions that the state wanted to\nbe reserved were reformulated and reduced to the following\nthree\nquestions:\n1\tWas the judge\na quo\nentitled to make factual findings on the\nbasis of inferences drawn from documents forming part of the record\nof the bail proceedings\nand to rule against the admissibility of\nevidence without affording the parties a proper opportunity to adduce\nevidence in respect\nof the relevant factual issues.\n2\tWas the judge\na quo\ncorrect in holding that when the\nadmissibility of a confession is challenged on the basis of an\nalleged violation of fundamental\nrights disputed by the State the\nmatter cannot and should not be resolved by way of a trial within a\ntrial but should be dealt with\nbefore embarking on a trial within a\ntrial in order to determine whether the confession had been made\nfreely and voluntarily.\n3\tDoes the failure to inform an accused of his right to remain silent\nduring\ns 119\nand\n121\n(1) of the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of\n1977\nconstitute a violation of the accusedâs fundamental rights\nrendering the accusedâs answers\nipso facto\ninadmissible at\nhis trial.\nThe parties addressed us on whether these questions should be\nreserved as well as on the merits of the appeal. I shall now deal\nwith\nboth these issues.\nQuestion 1\nWas the judge\na quo\nentitled to make factual\nfindings on the basis of inferences drawn from documents forming part\nof the record of the bail proceedings\nand to rule against the\nadmissibility of evidence without affording the parties a proper\nopportunity to adduce evidence in respect\nof the relevant factual\nissues.\n[33]\tIt does not follow from the fact that the record of the bail\nproceedings forms part of the record of the trial that evidence\nadduced during the bail proceedings must be treated as if that\nevidence had been adduced and received at the trial. The record of\nthe bail proceedings remains what it is, namely a record of what\ntranspired during the bail application.\n[34]\tThe judge\na quo\nrelied on statements made in documents\nhanded up during the bail application. These statements constituted\nhearsay evidence which\nhad not been admitted at the trial. He,\ntherefore, erred in doing so. In any event, that the judge\na quo\nwas not entitled to make factual findings without affording the\nparties a proper opportunity to adduce evidence in respect of the\nrelevant factual issues is so self evident that nothing further needs\nto be said in this regard.\nQuestion 2\nWas the judge\na quo\ncorrect in holding that\nwhen the admissibility of a confession is challenged on the basis of\nan alleged violation of fundamental\nrights disputed by the State the\nmatter cannot and should not be resolved by way of a trial within a\ntrial but should be dealt with\nbefore embarking on a trial within a\ntrial in order to determine whether the confession had been made\nfreely and voluntarily.\n[35]\tIn terms of s 35(1)(a),(b) and (c) of the Constitution a\nperson arrested for allegedly having committed an offence has\nthe\nright to remain silent, the right to be informed promptly of the\nright to remain silent and of the consequences of not remaining\nsilent and the right not to be compelled to make any confession or\nadmission that can be used in evidence against him. In terms of\ns 35(2)(b) and (c) a detained person has the right to choose and\nconsult with a legal practitioner, the right to be informed\nof this\nright promptly and the right to have a legal practitioner assigned to\nhim by the state and at state expense if substantial\njustice would\notherwise result and the right to be informed of this right promptly.\n[36]\tEvidence obtained in a manner that violates any of those rights\nmust, in terms of s 35(5), be excluded if the admission\nof that\nevidence would render the trial unfair or be detrimental to the\nadministration of justice.\n[37]\tIt follows that if the admissibility of a confession is\ncontested on the basis of a violation of any of those rights two\nquestions\narise. The one is whether the alleged violation occurred\nand the other is whether the admission of the confession would, as a\nresult\nof the violation, render the trial unfair or be detrimental to\nthe administration of justice. Whether that would be the case is a\nfactual issue which has to be decided upon the facts of each case. In\nthis regard Kriegler J said in\nKey v Attorney-General, Cape\nProvincial Division, and Another\n[1996] ZACC 25\n;\n1996 (4) SA 187\n(CC) at 196B:\nâ\nAt times fairness might require that evidence\nunconstitutionally obtained be excluded. But there will also be times\nwhen fairness\nwill require that evidence, albeit obtained\nunconstitutionally, nevertheless be admitted.â\n[38]\tIn the present case the facts were not common cause and the\ndispute in this regard had to be resolved before a ruling could\nbe\ngiven as to the admissibility of the confession. In order to resolve\nthe dispute the parties had to be given an opportunity to\nadduce such\nevidence as they wished to adduce in respect of the factual issues.\nIn these circumstances the judge\na quo\nâs view that the\nfactual dispute could not be resolved by way of a trial within a\ntrial but nevertheless had to be decided there\nand then makes no\nsense.\n[39]\tThe issue arose during the course of a criminal trial and had to\nbe dealt with in terms of the provisions of the\nCriminal Procedure\nAct which\nprescribes the manner in which evidence is to be adduced.\nThere was, therefore, at that stage, only one way to resolve the\nfactual\ndispute and that was by way of a trial within a trial. A\ntrial within a trial is, as the phrase indicates, a trial held while\nthe\nmain trial is in progress in order to determine a factual issue\nseparately from the main issues. Such a procedure is not unfair to\nan\naccused. On the contrary, it is a procedure that evolved in the\ninterests of justice and in fairness to the accused. In\nR v Wong\nKam-ming\n[1980] AC 247\n(PC) at 261B-C Lord Hailsham of St\nMarylebone said:\n'... (A)ny civilised system of criminal jurisprudence\nmust accord to the judiciary some means of excluding confessions or\nadmissions\n obtained by improper methods. This is not only because of\nthe potential unreliability of such statements, but also, and perhaps\nmainly, because in a civilised society it is vital that persons in\ncustody or charged with offences should not be subjected to\nill-treatment\nor improper pressure in order to extract confessions.\nIt is therefore of very great importance that the courts should\ncontinue to\ninsist that before extra-judicial statements can be\nadmitted in evidence the prosecution must be made to prove beyond\nreasonable\ndoubt that the statement was not obtained in a manner\nwhich should be reprobated and was therefore in the truest sense\nvoluntary.\nFor this reason it is necessary that the defendant should\nbe able and feel free either by his own testimony or by other means\nto\nchallenge the voluntary character of the tendered statement.'\nIn\nS v De Vries\n1989 (1) SA 228\n(A) at 233H-I Nicholas AJA\nafter having referred to this passage said:\nâ\nIt is accordingly essential that the issue of\nvoluntariness should be kept clearly distinct from the issue of\nguilt. This is achieved\nby insulating the inquiry into voluntariness\nin a compartment separate from the main trial. . . . In South Africa\n(the enquiry) is\nmade at a so-called âtrial within a trialâ.\nWhere therefore the question of admissibility of a confession is\nclearly raised,\nan accused person has the right to have that question\ntried as a separate and distinct issue. At such trial, the accused\ncan go into\nthe witness-box on the issue of voluntariness without\nbeing exposed to general cross-examination on the issue of guilt.\n(See\nR v Dunga\n1934 AD\n223\nat 226.)â\n[40]\tThe considerations which require that a trial within a trial be\nheld to determine whether a confession had been made voluntarily\napply with equal force when the admissibility of a confession is\ndisputed on the ground that it had been obtained in violation of\nother fundamental rights of the accused and when the relevant facts\nare not common cause between the parties.\n[41]\tApart from considering it inappropriate to resolve the issue as\nto whether there had been a breach of the appellantâs fundamental\nrights to be informed of his right to legal representation and to\nremain silent, by way of a trial within a trial, the judge\na quo\nalso considered it inappropriate to determine these issues together\nwith the issue as to whether the appellant acted freely and\nvoluntarily.\nHe held that these issues, being constitutional issues,\nhad to be decided separately from any other issues. Why he thought\nthat challenges\nto the admissibility of a confession on\nconstitutional grounds could not be dealt with at the same time that\nother challenges to\nits admissibility were being dealt with is not\nclear to me. I can think of no reason why all the factual issues\nrelating to the admissibility\nof a confession should not be dealt\nwith at one trial within a trial. As far as I know that is the common\npractice in the courts\nof first instance. In any event the judge\na\nquo\nwould seem not to have realised that to compel a person to\nmake an admission or to plead guilty is an even more serious\nviolation\nof a constitutional right than a failure to inform a person\nof his right to remain silent or to be legally represented.\n[42]\tFor these reasons the judge\na quo\nerred in holding that\nwhen the admissibility of a confession and pointing out is challenged\non the basis of an alleged violation\nof fundamental rights disputed\nby the State the matter cannot and should not be resolved by way of a\ntrial within a trial. He erred,\nfurthermore, in holding that the\ndispute should be dealt with before embarking on a trial within a\ntrial in order to determine whether\nthe confession and pointing out\nhad been made freely and voluntarily.\nQuestion 3\nDoes the failure to inform an accused of his right to remain\nsilent during (the proceedings in terms of)\ns 119\nand\ns 121\n(1) of the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\nconstitute a violation\nof the accusedâs fundamental rights rendering the accusedâs\nanswers\nipso facto\ninadmissible at his trial.\n[43]\nIn terms of\ns 35(3)(h)\nan accused has the right to a\nfair trial which includes the right to remain silent (not a right to\nbe informed of the right to remain\nsilent). The right is clearly one\nthat can be waived. For waiver knowledge is required. It is for this\nreason that accused should\nbe informed of their right to remain\nsilent at a trial so that an informed decision can be made as to\nwhether to remain silent or\nnot. A failure to so inform an accused\nmay result in the trial being unfair (\nDirector of Public\nProsecutions, Natal v Magidela and Another\n2000 (1) SACR 458\n(SCA) at para 18). But that can only be the case if the accused is\nunaware of his right to remain silent. The respondent never contended\nthat that was the case. It follows that the court\na quo\nerred\nin holding that the respondentâs right to remain silent during his\ntrial had been violated.\n[44]\tFor these reasons the three questions referred to are reserved\nand are decided in favour of the state.\n[45]\tThe question that now arises is to what relief the appellant is\nentitled. In terms of\ns 322(4)\nread with s 324 of the Act\nthis court having found in favour of the applicant has a discretion\nto order that proceedings in\nrespect of the same offence in respect\nof which the respondent was acquitted may again be instituted either\non the original charge,\nsuitably amended where necessary or upon any\nother charge as if the respondent had not previously been arraigned,\ntried and acquitted;\nprovided that no judge or assessor before whom\nthe original trial took place shall take part in such proceedings.\n(See\nS v Basson\n[2003] 3 All SA 51\n(SCA) at para 4 and 5).\n[46] \tWagenaar, who also appeared before us, submitted that we should\nnot exercise our discretion in favour of a trial\nde novo\nin\nthat (1) the respondent had been detained in prison for a period of\none year before his acquittal; (2) a trial\nde novo\nwould\nafford the state an opportunity to supplement its case; (3) more than\n3 years have elapsed since the respondentâs arrest\nand an accused\nhas a right to have his trial commenced and concluded without\nunreasonable delay. I shall deal with each of these\nsubmissions in\nturn.\n[47]\tThe respondent spent a year in prison before the trial commenced\nbut it was not contended that this was attributable to any\nfault on\nthe part of the state.\n[48]\tIt is true that the state will be given an opportunity to\nsupplement its case but it was wrongly deprived of that opportunity\nat the instance of the respondent (although only after having been\nprompted to do so by the court\na quo\n). In these circumstances\nit is not unfair to now give the state an opportunity to do so.\n[49]\tIt is regrettable that proceedings\nde novo\nwill only be\ninstituted almost four years after the commission of the crime but it\nis not the applicant who is to blame for the delay.\nThe delay was\nbrought about by the untenable arguments advanced by the respondent\nand adopted by the court\na quo\n. There is, furthermore, no\nreason to fear that the respondent would by prejudiced in his defence\nby the delay.\n[50]\tThe respondent has, therefore, not advanced any valid reason why\nwe should refuse to exercise our discretion in favour of a\ntrial\nde\nnovo\n. There are on the other hand cogent reasons why we should so\nexercise our discretion. The appellant was charged with the\ncommission\nof a very serious crime but the state was not allowed a\nproper opportunity to prosecute him. A refusal to order that a trial\nde novo\nmay be instituted in the face of a confession and a\nplea of guilty, the admissibility of which the state was not allowed\nto prove,\nwould be unfair to the prosecuting authority, would be\ndetrimental to the administration of justice and will in fact bring\nthe administration\nof justice in disrepute.\n[51]\tFor these reasons, the questions of law having been reserved and\nhaving been decided in favour of the applicant, the following\norder\nis made:\nProceedings in respect of the same offence in respect of which the\nrespondent was acquitted may again be instituted either on the\noriginal charge, suitably amended where necessary or upon any other\ncharge as if the respondent had not previously been arraigned,\ntried\nand acquitted; provided that no judge or assessor before whom the\noriginal trial took place shall take part in such proceedings.\n__________________\nP E STREICHER\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nNAVSA\nJA)\nVAN\nHEERDEN JA\n)\nERASMUS AJA)\tCONCUR\nPONNAN AJA)",

    "facts": "The respondent, Pieter Nicolaas Jacobus Viljoen, was charged with murdering his wife. He initially pleaded guilty in magistrate proceedings under sections 119 and 121 of the Criminal Procedure Act, but later entered a not‑guilty plea at trial in the Transvaal Provincial Division. During bail proceedings a number of documents were produced – a confession, notices of rights and a \"Waarskuwingsverklaring\" – which were not admitted as evidence at the trial. The trial judge concluded that the confession, the pointing‑out and the s 119 plea proceedings violated the respondent’s constitutional rights under section 35 and excluded the evidence, resulting in an acquittal.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised three legal questions: (1) Whether the trial judge could make factual findings from bail‑record documents and exclude evidence without giving the parties an opportunity to adduce evidence; (2) Whether a confession whose admissibility is challenged on constitutional grounds must be resolved before any trial‑within‑a‑trial; and (3) Whether the failure to inform the accused of his right to remain silent during s 119/121 proceedings constitutes a constitutional violation that renders his answers inadmissible.",
    "principles": "Sections 35(1)–(3) of the Constitution protect the right to remain silent and the right to legal representation; evidence obtained in breach of those rights must be excluded under s 35(5) if its admission would render the trial unfair. Hearsay evidence not admitted at trial cannot be relied upon. Determinations of voluntariness and constitutional breaches are factual inquiries that may be resolved by a trial‑within‑a‑trial, as established in Key v Attorney‑General, R v Wong and S v De Vries. Procedural fairness requires that parties be given the opportunity to present evidence on factual disputes.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court found that the trial judge erred by relying on hearsay from the bail record, by refusing the parties the chance to present evidence on the factual issues, and by incorrectly holding that constitutional questions preclude a trial‑within‑a‑trial. The Court also held that the failure to inform the accused of his right to remain silent did not, by itself, amount to a violation warranting exclusion of his statements. Consequently, the three reserved questions were decided in favour of the State.",
    "conclusion": "The Court reserved the questions of law for the appellant and ordered that proceedings for the same offence may be instituted anew, either on the original charge or an amended charge, as if the respondent had not previously been arraigned, tried or acquitted, provided that none of the judges or assessors from the original trial sit in the new proceedings."
