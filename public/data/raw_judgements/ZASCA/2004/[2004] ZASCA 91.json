Rival contentions were advanced on behalf of the\nbuilding contractor, Club Refrigeration CC (‘Club Refrigeration’),\nwho was the successful applicant in the court\na quo\nand is the respondent\non appeal; and on behalf of the liquidators of the employer, Fisher Foods SA\n(Pty) Ltd (‘Fisher Foods’).\nThe liquidators were cited jointly in\nthe court\na quo\nas the first respondent and are the appellants in the\nappeal. Because of the arguments advanced before this court, the facts will\nhave\nto be set out in some detail.\n[2]\tFisher Foods intended constructing a\nfactory in Kempton Park. To that end, it called for tenders. Club Refrigeration\nCC submitted\nsuch a tender dated 5 October 2001. The tender was for the\nconstruction of the factory and the supply of certain items of equipment\nwhich\nformed part of the factory but which remained movable. It contained the\nfollowing clauses which are relevant for present\npurposes:\n‘\nPRICES:\nFixed price for all items as\nspecified\t\tR10 991 000.00.\nPAYMENT TERMS\nInterim progress\npayments during the site work schedule to up to 90% of the contract price\n10%\non completion and before commercial use.\nACCEPTANCE\nThe price is\nfixed for a period of 28 days from the date of quotation.\nAll items of\nequipment remain the property of Club Refrigeration CC until they are paid for\nin full.\nCONTRACT TERMS\nAs per JBCC principle building agreement,\ncode 2101, July 2000.’\nThe reference to the ‘JBCC principle\nbuilding agreement’ was to the July 2000 version of the Principal Building\nAgreement\nprepared by the Joint Building Contracts Committee\nInc.\n[3]\tFisher Foods responded to the tender by sending a document to\nthe applicant dated 15 November 2001. The document was entitled\n‘Order’ and it contained inter alia the following\nprovisions:\n‘This order is to confirm our acceptance of the Fixed Price\nTender dated 15 10 2001...\nA deposit of thirty per cent of the agreed price\n(R3,297,300.00, Three million Two Hundred and Ninety Seven Thousand Three\nHundred\nRand) will be paid on receipt of your confirmation of the fixed price\nand is also subject to the following:\n•\tReceipt of an agreed and signed copy of the JBCC building agreement code\n2101 published July 2000 and the relevant Bank guarantee\npertaining to this\nagreement. All further payments will be in accordance with the JCBB building\nagreement...’\nClub Refrigeration thereafter submitted a\nsigned copy of the JBCC agreement to Fisher Foods.\n[4]\tThe building works\nundertaken by Fisher Foods were financed by the Industrial Development\nCorporation of South Africa Limited\n(‘the IDC’). The IDC was joined\nas the second respondent in the court\na quo\n. It registered a general\nnotarial bond over the movable assets of Fisher Foods to secure the loan and\nsubsequently perfected the\nbond shortly before Fisher Foods was\nliquidated.\n[5]\tThe project was completed by Club Refrigeration, who\nsubmitted a claim to Fisher Foods for the outstanding amount payable in terms\nof\nthe contract. Fisher Foods was liquidated and the liquidators were appointed\nbefore any payment was made by Fisher Foods in respect\nof the claim. The claim\ncomprised composite amounts for goods and labour.\n[6]\tThe present matter\nconcerns movable goods included in the claim. Club Refrigeration and the IDC\nmade competing claims to these\ngoods. It is important to emphasize, for reasons\nwhich will become apparent, that Club Refrigeration’s claim was based on\nits\nownership of the goods; it was not for payment of the claim in terms of the\ncontract. The liquidators at no stage contended that\nthe goods had become the\nproperty of Fisher Foods by\naccessio\nand expressly admitted that they\nwere movables. A third party, Afgri Operations Limited, wished to purchase the\ngoods. Ultimately,\na tripartite contract was concluded between Club\nRefrigeration, the liquidators and the IDC relating to the disposal of the goods\n(referred to as the ‘sale assets’) which contained the following\nrelevant terms:\n‘2.\tRECORDAL\n2.1\tThe assets referred to in annex\n“A” hereto (“the sale assets”) are in the  \tpossession\nof the joint provisional\nliquidators at the premises of FISHER \tFOODS SOUTH\nAFRICA (PTY) LIMITED (in liquidation) at 17 POMONA \tROAD, AVIATION PARK, KEMPTON\nPARK.\n2.2\tA general notarial covering bond was registered by FISHER FOODS\nSOUTH \tAFRICA (PTY) LIMITED (“Fisher Foods”) in favour\nof the IDC\nover the \tmovable assets of Fisher Foods under bond number BN45130/2002\n(“the \tGNB”).\n2.3\tIDC contends that:\n2.3.1\tthe sale assets\nfall under the GNB;\n2.3.2\tit has perfected its security in terms of the\nGNB.\n2.4\tClub Refrigeration contends that it has reserved rights of ownership\nin the \tsale assets pursuant to the sale thereof by Club\nRefrigeration to Fisher\n\tFoods.\n2.5\tAFGRI OPERATIONS LIMITED (“Afgri”) wishes to purchase\nthe sale assets \tfrom the joint provisional liquidators for\na purchase price of\nR1,280,000.00 \t(one million two hundred and eighty thousand rands)\nplus\nVAT (“the purchase \tprice”).\n3.\tTHE SALE ASSETS\n3.1\tIDC and\nClub Refrigeration hereby agree that the joint provisional liquidators \tare\nentitled to sell the sale assets to Afgri\nfor the purchase price which shall \tbe\nheld by the joint provisional liquidators in an interest bearing account and\n\tpaid to IDC\nand/or Club Refrigeration depending on which of them is found to\n\tbe entitled thereto (whether in whole or in part) having regard\nto the \n\tcontentions of each of them respectively as set out in 2.3 and 2.4\nabove.\n3.2\tThe determination as to which of IDC or Club Refrigeration is\nentitled to the \twhole or portion of the purchase price shall be\ndetermined by a\ncourt of \tcompetent jurisdiction unless the method of determination is otherwise\nagreed \tin writing by IDC and Club\nRefrigeration.\n...\n3.5\tThe joint\nprovisional liquidators give no acknowledgement or undertaking to \teither IDC or\nClub Refrigeration with regard to their\nclaims as set out in 2.3 \tand 2.4 above\nand will deal with the proceeds of the purchase price in terms \tof the\nliquidation and distribution\naccount relating to Fisher Foods South \tAfrica\n(Pty) Limited (in liquidation) in due course, unless otherwise determined \tin\naccordance\nwith clause 3.2 above.’\n[7]\tThe goods were then sold to\nAfgri for R1,28 million. Club Refrigeration commenced motion proceedings in the\ncourt\na quo\nin which it claimed a declaratory order that on the date of\nthe commencement of the winding up of Fisher Foods, it was the owner\nof the\ngoods; and it further sought an order that the liquidators be directed to pay\nthe proceeds of the sale of the goods, i.e.\nR1,28 million, to it. The basis of\nClub Refrigeration’s claim as set out in the founding affidavit was that\nit had sold the\ngoods to Fisher Foods in terms of a contract in which it\nreserved ownership in them until paid. The liquidators opposed the application\non the basis that there was no reservation of ownership clause but that if there\nwere, s 84(1) of the Insolvency Act had the effect\nof transferring the ownership\nin the goods to them, subject to a hypothec in favour of Club Refrigeration. The\nIDC did not participate\nin the proceedings. In argument before the court\na\nquo\n, counsel for Club Refrigeration changed tack and submitted that the\ngoods had not been sold to Fisher Foods, but had been supplied\nin terms of a\ncontract of\nlocatio conductio operis\n; and that s 84(1) was accordingly\nnot applicable. The court\na quo\n(Botha J) granted the relief sought by\nClub Refrigeration and the present appeal is with the leave of that\ncourt.\n[8]\tBefore dealing with the four submissions made by counsel for\nthe liquidators, it would be desirable to record that in argument\nbefore this\ncourt it was common cause that the contract between the appellant and Fisher\nFoods was indeed a contract of\nlocatio conductio operis\n, and that s 84(1)\nof the Insolvency Act ─ limited, as it is, to instalment sale transactions\n─ was accordingly not applicable.\n[9]\tThe first submission made by\ncounsel for the liquidators was that the contract between Club Refrigeration and\nFisher Foods contained\nno reservation of ownership clause inasmuch as, said\ncounsel, the order placed by Fisher Foods constituted a counter offer which\nwas\naccepted by Club Refrigeration. That meant, said counsel, that the terms of the\nJBCC agreement alone governed the contract between\nparties. Counsel relied in\nparticular on clause 1.8 of the JBCC agreement, which reads:\n‘This\nagreement is the entire contract between the parties regarding the matters\naddressed in this agreement. No representations,\nterms, conditions or warranties\nnot contained in this agreement shall be binding on the parties. No agreement or\naddendum varying,\nadding to, deleting or cancelling this agreement shall be\neffective unless reduced to writing and signed by the\nparties.’\n[10]\tThe argument is untenable. The tender was\nincorporated in the JBCC agreement signed on behalf of Club Refrigeration and\nsent\nto Fisher Foods, as required in the order placed by Fisher Foods on Club\nRefrigeration. Clause 2 of that agreement provides:\n‘2.0\tOFFER\nACCEPTANCE AND PERFORMANCE\n2.1\tThe objective of this agreement is the\nexecution of and payment for the works \tfor which there has been an offer by the\ncontractor\nand an acceptance thereof \tby the employer.\n2.2\tIn pursuance of\nsuch an objective the parties undertake to carry out \ttheir reciprocal\nobligations in terms of this agreement.’\n‘Agreement’ is\ndefined as meaning ‘this JBCC Principal Building Agreement and other\ncontract documents which together\nform the contract between the employer and\ncontractor’; and ‘contract documents’ are, in turn, defined as\nmeaning\n‘this document, the contract drawings, the ... lump sum document\nand such other documents as are identified in the schedule’.\nIn the\nschedule, under the heading ‘Contract documents marked and annexed\nhereto’ the word ‘yes’ has been\nfilled in opposite ‘lump\nsum document’. The relevant part of the definition of ‘lump sum\ndocument’ in clause\n1 is ‘the document providing the lump sum amount\npriced by the contractor to reflect the contract sum’. That document\nmust\nhave been Club Refrigeration’s tender, as counsel representing the\nliquidators was constrained to concede.\n[11]\tThe second argument\nadvanced by counsel representing the liquidators was that because the contract\nbetween Club Refrigeration\nand Fisher Foods was a lump sum contract, unless\nthere is a mechanism for ascertaining which portion of the contract price\npertained\nto particular movable assets to be delivered in terms of the\nagreement, it will be impossible to determine whether payment for individual\nitems had been made; and there is no such mechanism. In my view, there\nis.\n[12]\tThe order placed by Fisher Foods made specific provision for\npayment in terms of the JBCC agreement. Clause 31 of the JBCC agreement\nprovides\nfor interim payments to be made to the contractor. Clause 31.4 provides that the\nvalue certified in an interim payment certificate\nshall separately\ninclude:\n’31.4.1\tA reasonable estimate of the value of the work\nexecuted ...\n31.4.2\t\tA reasonable estimate of the value of materials and\ngoods in terms of \t\t31.6...’\n(It is not necessary for present purposes\nto have regard to clause 31.6 or to consider the submission by counsel\nrepresenting the\nliquidators that the court\na quo\nwas incorrect in\nconsidering that the movable goods at issue in these proceedings would fall to\nbe certified under clause 31.4.2.)\nClause 31.9 provides that the employer shall\npay to the contractor the amount certified within seven calendar days of the\ndate of\nissue of the payment certificate. Clause 31.7 provides that materials\nand goods paid for in terms of clause 31.9 shall become the\nproperty of the\nemployer. This is the mechanism by which it can be determined which part of the\nprice has been allocated for specific\ngoods and whether particular goods have\nbeen paid for. Clause 31.7 dovetails easily with the reservation of ownership\nprovisions\nin Club Refrigeration’s tender: The latter provides that until\ngoods are paid for, ownership remains vested in Club Refrigeration;\nand the\nformer provides that once payment has been made for goods (whether they have\nbeen incorporated in the works or not and therefore\nirrespective of whether\naccessio\napplies), ownership in them will pass to the employer i.e.\nFisher Foods.\n[13]\tThe liquidators have at no stage suggested that Club\nRefrigeration has been paid for the goods. They bear the onus of proof on\nthis\npoint. The specific allegation in the founding affidavit that Club Refrigeration\nhas not been paid, has not been contradicted.\nFurthermore, the tripartite\nagreement can only have been entered into on the basis that Club Refrigeration\nhad not been paid for\nthe goods in question; for otherwise the provisions of\nClause 31.7 of the JBCC agreement would have provided a complete answer to\nClub\nRefrigeration’s claim that it was the owner of the goods.\n[14]\tThe\nthird submission by counsel for the liquidators was that because the value of\nthe goods was not specified in any payment\ncertificate, whether interim or\nfinal, Club Refrigeration was not entitled to payment in respect of those goods\nin terms of the JBCC\nagreement forming part of its contract with Fisher Foods.\nBut that is irrelevant. Club Refrigeration does not seek payment for the\ngoods\nin terms of the JBCC agreement. It seeks to enforce its right to payment of the\nproceeds of the sale of the goods in terms\nof the tripartite agreement because\nit was the owner of the goods when insolvency supervened.\n[15]\tCounsel\nrepresenting the liquidators submitted that the tripartite agreement does not\nmean that if Club Refrigeration succeeded\nin proving that its contract with\nFisher Foods contained a reservation of ownership clause in its favour, it would\nbe entitled to\nthe proceeds of the sale of the goods. In my view, that is\nprecisely what the tripartite agreement means. In terms of clause 3.1,\nthe\nliquidators undertook to pay the proceeds of the sale of the goods to IDC and/or\nClub Refrigeration ‘depending on which\nof them is found to be entitled\nthereto (whether in whole or in part) having regard to the contentions of each\nof them’. The\ncontention of Club Refrigeration set out in clause 2.4 was\nthat it had reserved the right of ownership in the goods. It is true that\nClub\nRefrigeration contended that it had sold the goods to Fisher Foods, whereas it\nhad not; but that makes no difference. The essence\nof Club Refrigeration’s\nclaim was that it had retained ownership of the goods because of its contract\nwith Fisher Foods. In\nclause 3.5, the liquidators undertook to deal with the\nproceeds of the purchase price in terms of the liquidation and distribution\naccount in due course ‘unless otherwise determined in accordance with\nclause 3.2’. Clause 3.2 envisaged a determination\nbetween the competing\nclaims of the IDC and Club Refrigeration by a court. The determination has been\nmade in favour of Club Refrigeration\nand it will be confirmed on appeal.\n[16]\tCounsel representing the liquidators, in submitting that the\ntripartite agreement should not be given its plain meaning, pointed\nout that\nwhen liquidation supervened the contract between Club Refrigeration and Fisher\nFoods was executory or incomplete; and submitted\nthat it cannot be established\nwhether the liquidators decided not to carry on with the execution of the\ncontract, and thereby repudiated\nit, much less whether Club Refrigeration\naccepted any such repudiation and cancelled the contract. But all of this is\nirrelevant.\nClub Refrigeration’s claim to the proceeds of the sale of the\ngoods is based on the fact that it owned them. It has made no\nclaim in these\nproceedings to participate in the proceeds of the liquidation of Fisher Foods.\nIn entering into the tripartite agreement\nthe liquidators correctly recognised\nthat if Club Refrigeration was the owner of the goods, the proceeds of the sale\nof the goods\ncould never form part of the assets of Fisher Foods and would have\nto be paid over to Club Refrigeration.\n[17]\tTo sum up: Club Refrigeration\nreserved ownership in the goods supplied by it to Fisher Foods until it was\npaid. The agreement\nbetween Club Refrigeration and Fisher Foods was a lump sum\nagreement but because of the interim certificate provisions it contained,\nit can\nbe determined that Club Refrigeration was not paid for certain movable goods\nsupplied by it. Club Refrigeration agreed with\nthe liquidators of Fisher Foods\nthat these goods could be sold to a third party and the liquidators undertook\nthat if Club Refrigeration\nproved in a court of law that it had been the owner\nof the goods, they would pay the proceeds of the sale to Club Refrigeration.\nClub Refrigeration has proved this and is accordingly entitled to\npayment.\n[18]\tThe appeal is dismissed, with costs.\n______________\nT D CLOETE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nConcur: Scott JA\nMthiyane JA\nErasmus AJA\nJafta\nAJA",

    "facts": "Fisher Foods sought to construct a factory in Kempton Park and invited tenders. Club Refrigeration CC submitted a tender dated 5 October 2001 offering a fixed lump‑sum price of R10,991,000 and a reservation of ownership clause stating that all items of equipment would remain its property until paid in full. Fisher Foods accepted the tender on 15 November 2001, conditioned on the signing of the JBCC Principal Building Agreement and a bank guarantee. The project was financed by the IDC, which secured its loan with a general notarial bond over Fisher Foods' movable assets. Club Refrigeration completed the works, but before Fisher Foods could pay the outstanding amount, Fisher Foods went into liquidation. The liquidators, together with the IDC, entered into a tripartite agreement with Club Refrigeration to sell the movable goods to a third party (Afgri Operations Ltd) for R1.28 million, pending determination of ownership rights.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised (1) whether the reservation of ownership clause in a locatio conductio operis (lump‑sum building) contract remained effective despite the employer’s insolvency; (2) whether section 84(1) of the Insolvency Act, which transfers ownership in instalment sale transactions, applied to this contract; and (3) who was entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the movable goods – the liquidators/IDC or Club Refrigeration.",
    "principles": "The court applied the principle that section 84(1) of the Insolvency Act is limited to instalment sale arrangements and does not affect contracts of locatio conductio operis. Under the JBCC agreement, clause 31.7 provides that ownership of materials and goods passes to the employer once payment is made, while clause 31.4 allows the contractor to certify the value of specific goods for interim payment. A reservation of title clause is effective in a lump‑sum contract where the contractor can demonstrate that payment for the specific goods has not been made. The burden of proving payment lies with the liquidators.",
    "application": "The court found that the contract between Club Refrigeration and Fisher Foods was indeed a locatio conductio operis. The tender and the JBCC agreement incorporated the reservation of ownership clause, and the interim payment mechanism under clause 31.4/31.7 enabled the court to determine that Club Refrigeration had not been paid for the movable goods. Consequently, ownership of the goods remained with Club Refrigeration at the time of liquidation. The tripartite agreement expressly required the liquidators to pay the sale proceeds to whichever party was proven to own the goods; having established ownership, Club Refrigeration was entitled to the R1.28 million.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The court affirmed the lower court’s judgment that Club Refrigeration retained ownership of the movable goods and was therefore entitled to the proceeds of their sale. Costs were awarded to Club Refrigeration."
