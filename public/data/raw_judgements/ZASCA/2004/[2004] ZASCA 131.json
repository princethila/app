    "facts": "The appellant, J Z Brink, signed a credit application on behalf of a company and, in doing so, also provided a personal guarantee (suretyship). The dispute arose over whether the personal guarantee was enforceable against the appellant, given that the guarantee was presented in a corporate credit context.",
    "issues": "The primary issue was whether the defence of iustus error applied to protect the appellant from personal liability arising from the suretyship, and whether the signatory’s personal guarantee could be deemed binding on the company without the appellant’s explicit personal assent.",
    "principles": "The court considered the doctrine of iustus error, which shields a party from liability where a mistake of law or fact makes the contract voidable, and established principles of contract law concerning the authority to bind a company and the validity of personal suretyship when the guarantor’s consent is not clearly expressed.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that the personal suretyship was included without the appellant’s clear, informed consent and therefore fell within the ambit of iustus error. Consequently, the personal guarantee could not be enforced against the appellant, and the company could not be held liable for the personal element of the guarantee.",
    "conclusion": "The defence of iustus error was upheld, resulting in the dismissal of the claim against the appellant. The court ordered the respondent’s claim to be struck out, as reflected in paragraph 13 of the judgment."
