It\nholds the trade marks of the group. A local member of the group is The South\nAfrican Breweries Ltd.\nIt produces and sells beer and uses a series of Carling\nBlack Label trade marks under licence from\nSabmark.\n[3]\nIt is common cause that\nthe name mark ‘Carling Black\nLabel’\n[4]\nhas not been infringed\nand the case concerns two marks which consist of a representation of Black Label\nstickers on the neck and\nbody of a beer\nbottle.\n[5]\nThe discussion will be\nlimited to one of these because it is not in dispute that what applies to the\none applies to the other.\n[3]\tThe label (see the annexure to the judgment)\non the neck contains the words ‘Carling’ and ‘enjoyed by men\naround\nthe world’, all in black uppercase type on a red background between\ntwo golden lines. The sticker for the body of the bottle\nis much larger and is\noblong. The background is red. There are also two gold lines, the upper one\ncontaining the phrase ‘America’s\nlusty, lively beer’ and the\nlower one ‘Brewed in South Africa’, all in black upper case. In a\nparallelogram with\na black background the words ‘Carling Black Label\nBeer’ appear – ‘Carling’ and ‘beer’ in\nred\ntypeface and ‘Black Label’ in white script.\n[4]\tThe appellant is\na close corporation and the alter ego of Mr JB Nurse. He graduated in journalism\nand politics at Rhodes University\nand holds a postgraduate diploma in enterprise\nmanagement. He has a special interest in the effect of trade marks and branding\non\nsociety. The appellant, he says, is the result of the thought, research and\ninput of a collective of graduates and students from\nRhodes. ‘They’\nare ‘conscientious objectors to niche-market selfhood and mass-market\nmediocrity’ who ‘grew\nup to be brand atheists’. In order to\nbring this point home, the appellant markets clothing – mainly, it would\nseem,\nT-shirts – using well-known logos and trade marks ‘back\non’ themselves. Nurse calls it ‘ideological jujitsu’\nin which\nthe weight of a brand is used against itself.\n[5]\tIn relation to the Black\nLabel neck and body mark, the jujitsu grip consists of what may be characterised\nas a caricature of the\nsaid trade mark used on T-shirts shown as an annexure. It\nemploys the general lay-out and colours of the registered mark. However,\nthe\nmessage is different. The words ‘Black Label’ were replaced with\n‘Black Labour’ and ‘Carling Beer’\nwith ‘White\nGuilt’. The laudatory part on the label was replaced by\n‘Africa’s lusty, lively exploitation\nsince 1652’ and ‘No\nregard given worldwide’.\nThe litigation\n[6]\tIn the court\nbelow the trademark owner applied for an interdict based on s 34(1)(c).\nInitially the appellant raised the constitutionality\nof the provision but later\nabandoned it. (As will appear later, anti-dilution provisions are common in\nmajor democracies that hold\nfreedom of expression in high regard.) Cleaver J\nfound against the appellant. He apparently accepted the submission that the\nmessage\nconveyed by the T-shirts was that SAB has in the past exploited and\ncontinues to exploit black labour and is guilty of racial discrimination\nand\nthat the words conjure up this country’s racist past by falsely\nattributing to SAB the lusty and lively exploitation of\nblack labour since 1652,\nthe year during which the Dutch settled in the Cape. This message, he held,\nestablished that the appellant’s\nuse of its caricature of the Black Label\ntrade mark would be likely to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the\ndistinctive\ncharacter or repute of the trade marks in question. Freedom of\nexpression, the learned judge held, did not justify the actions of\nthe appellant\nbecause the appellant deliberately exploited the marks for commercial gain (it\nis an admitted fact that it will not\nbe able to sell its T-shirts without using\ncaricatures of well-known marks) and its lampooning or parodying was not a\nharmless clean\npun which merely parodies or pokes fun but bordered on hate\nspeech. He accordingly held that the appellant’s conduct was covered\nby s\n34(1)(c) and issued an interdict. (I shall revert to its terms in due course.)\n[7]\tCleaver J granted the necessary leave to appeal to this court. We\ngranted the Freedom of Expression Institute (‘FXI’)\nleave to\nintervene as\namicus curiae\nand it was duly represented by counsel. As\nwill become apparent, the issues before us on appeal were limited. In\nparticular, it should\nbe noted, the constitutionality of s 34(1)(c) was accepted\nby all.\nThe approach to trademark infringement\n[8]\tConcern is\nexpressed from time to time about the pervasiveness of trade marks, the fact\nthat trademark owners tend to be voracious\nand that trademark protection is not\nalways kept within its legitimate bounds. Nurse, in his affidavit, raises this\nas a justification\nfor attacking well-known marks. He says, for instance, that\n‘they’ (presumably he and his colleagues) are doing their\nbit to\npromote freedom of expression in a world where commercial expression and debate\nis being crowded out in the name of the protection\nof a brand. He also believes\nthat brands tend to control ideas and concepts. Some of this, but not all, is\nhyperbole.\n[6]\n[9]\tProf David Vaver,\nfor one, has pointed out that intellectual property cannot be treated as an\nabsolute value. Its value should\nbe weighed up against a range of values of at\nleast equal importance such as the ‘right of people to imitate others, to\nwork,\ncompete, talk, and write freely, and to nurture common\ncultures.’\n[7]\nThis court, too,\non occasion emphasised that intellectual property rights should be confined\nwithin their legitimate \nboundaries.\n[8]\nIf so confined, the\nconcerns expressed can be accommodated considerably.\n[10]\tOn the other hand,\nand in spite of  some judicial resistance in certain\nquarters,\n[9]\ntrade marks are property,\nalbeit intangible or incorporeal. The fact that property is intangible does not\nmake it of a lower order.\n[10]\nOur\nlaw has always recognised incorporeals as a class of things in spite of\ntheoretical objections thereto.\n[11]\nAlso, simply because, as the appellant has it, trademark protection and branding\nare the result and part of a ‘capitalistic’\neconomy does not mean\nthat trade marks may be disregarded by those who do not believe in such an\neconomy.\n[11]\tBut then again, intellectual property rights have no special\nstatus. The Constitution does not accord them special protection\nand they are\nnot immune to constitutional challenge. Even if constitutional, their\nenforcement must be constitutionally\njustifiable.\n[12]\nThe problem, as\nwill appear later, is that the question of how far guarantees of freedom of the\nmedia and expression affect intellectual\nproperty rights, is, except for the\nUSA, somewhat virgin\nterritory.\n[13]\nAnti-dilution\nand trademark infringement\n[12]\tIn\nBeecham Group plc v Triomed (Pty)\nLtd\n[14]\nwe pointed out that the\nfunction of a trade mark, in terms of the definition in the Act, is to indicate\nthe origin of the goods or\nservices.  In a footnote we quoted the European Court\nof Justice where it held that the essential function of the trade mark is to\nguarantee the identity of the origin of the marked product to the consumer or\nend user by enabling him, without any possibility of\nconfusion, to distinguish\nthe product or service from others which have another origin.\n[15]\n[13]\nBeecham\nalso pointed\nout that the protection granted to a trade mark by s 34(1) and its secondary\ncommercial functions extend beyond the\n‘badge of origin’ concept. \nSection 34(1)(c) in particular is not concerned with either origin or confusion.\nIt protects\nthe economic value of a trade mark, more particularly its reputation\nand its advertising value or selling\npower.\n[16]\nAs summed up by Tony\nMartino:\n[17]\n‘A trademark\nis a “creative ‘silent salesman’” stimulating sales by\ncreating goodwill and assuring buyers\nthat all goods bearing the same mark have\nthe same quality. “The mark actually\nsells\nthe goods”; the\nmore distinctive the mark, the greater its selling\npower.’\n[18]\n[14]\tThe\nanti-dilution doctrine can be traced to German jurisprudence but was first\nformulated with a measure of precision by  Frank\nI\nScheckter.\n[19]\nWhat Scheckter\nprincipally had in mind was dilution by means of blurring of a trade mark when\nused on non-competing goods. He gave\nthe example of the blurring of Rolls-Royce\nif the mark were to be used for restaurants, cafeterias, pants or candy. A\nmodern German\nexample is the use of the trade mark Dimple for whiskey in\nrelation to cosmetics.\n[20]\n[15]\tThe instant case is, however, not concerned with blurring but rather\nwith tarnishment. FW Mostert\n[21]\nquotes another German case to illustrate: the owner of the well-known perfume\n‘4711’ was able to interdict a sewer company\nfrom using the number\non a malodorous tank truck even though the number only formed part of its\ntelephone number. Courts in different\njurisdictions have come to similar\nconclusions on similar facts in this regard. For instance, the use of the\nAmerican Express charge\ncard and the slogan ‘Don’t leave home\nwithout it’ in relation to condoms was not acceptable to a US\ncourt.\n[22]\nIn Germany, the Federal\nSupreme Court found that the use of the confectionary trade mark Mars and its\nslogan that it will liven you\nup in relation to a gag item consisting of a\ncondom, tarnished Mars.\n[23]\nAnd in\nEngland an attempt to register Visa as a trade mark, also in relation to\ncondoms, was dismissed on the same\nground.\n[24]\n[16]\tIn the USA some\nstates adopted anti-dilution statutes, the first being Massachusetts in\n1949.\n[25]\nThe problem is that these\nlaws are not in identical terms.  As far a the federal position is concerned,\nCongress in 1995 amended\ns 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (the Lanham Act) to\nprovide a\nremedy for the dilution of famous\nmarks.\n[26]\nThat amendment, the\nFederal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), provides that –\n‘the owner\nof a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon\nsuch terms as the court deems reasonable,\nto an injunction against another\nperson's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins\nafter the mark has\nbecome famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality\nof the mark, and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this\nsubsection.’\nFDTA describes the factors that determine whether a mark\nis ‘distinctive and famous,’ and defines ‘dilution’\nas\n‘the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and\ndistinguish goods or services.’ It sets out a number\nof specific defences\nnamely fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial\nadvertising or promotion to identify\nthe competing goods or services of the\nowner of the famous mark; non-commercial use of a mark; and all forms of news\nreporting and\nnews commentary.\n[17]\tA European Community\ndirective\n[27]\nprovides in relation\nto trademark infringement, inter alia, as follows in art\n5:\n‘2. Any Member State may also provide that the\nproprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent\nfrom using in the course of trade any sign which is identical with, or similar\nto, the trade mark in relation to goods or services\nwhich are not similar to\nthose for which the trade mark is registered, where the latter has a reputation\nin the Member State and\nwhere use of that sign without due cause takes unfair\nadvantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute\nof\nthe trade mark.’\n‘5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not affect\nprovisions in any Member State relating to the protection against the use of a\nsign other\nthan for the purposes of distinguishing goods or services, where use\nof that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or\nis detrimental to,\nthe distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark.’\n[18]\tThis\nled to a White Paper on the ‘Reform of Trade Mark Law’, 1990 in the\nUnited Kingdom. The subsequent UK Trade\nMarks Act 1994 (ch 26) deals with the\nissue in s 10(3):\n‘A person infringes a registered trade mark if he\nuses in the course of trade a sign which –\n(a)\tis identical with or similar to the trade mark, and\n(b)\t is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for\nwhich the trade mark is registered,\nwhere the trade mark has a\nreputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign, being without due\ncause, takes unfair advantage\nof, or is detrimental to, the distinctive\ncharacter or the repute of the trade mark.’\n(According to the\n‘Memorandum on the Objects of the Draft Trade Marks Bill’ an object\nof our current Act, was to harmonise\nour law with that of the European\nCommunity, taking into account the said White\nPaper.)\n[28]\n[19]\tAlthough\nreliance will be placed in the course of this judgment on foreign case law it\nmust be understood that it is done principally\nin order to illustrate or to\ncompare. The different statutory setting of all these cases must always be kept\nin mind.  It is also\nnot suggested that the outcome in those cases would\nnecessarily have been the same had the case been decided under our legislation\nand in our social context.\nInterpreting s 34(1)(c)\n[20]\tThis\nprovision has arisen but parenthetically in our case\nlaw.\n[29]\nAt first blush its meaning\nis clear. In order to establish infringement, the owner of the trade mark must\nestablish:\n(a)\tthe unauthorized use by the defendant of a mark\n(b)\tin the course of trade\n(c)\tin relation to any goods or services\n(d)\tthe mark must be identical or similar to a registered trade mark,\n(e)\tthe trade mark must be well known in the Republic, and\n(f)\tthe use of the defendant’s mark would be likely to take unfair\nadvantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character\nor the repute of\nthe registered trade mark.\nAs mentioned, the defendant’s\nuse need not be in relation to\nsimilar\ngoods or services and the\nliability is not dependent on confusion or deception.\n[21]\tNothing as far as\ninterpretation is concerned turns on integers (a) to (e), but (f) on the other\nhand requires some elucidation.\nIt must, obviously, be interpreted in the light\nof the Constitution and its application must be such that it does not unduly\nrestrict\na party’s freedom of\nexpression.\n[30]\nThis requires a\nweighing-up of the freedom of expression and the trademark owner’s rights\nof property and freedom of trade,\noccupation or profession.\n[22]\tIn the\nordinary course of events acts proscribed by the provision will not impinge on a\ndefendant’s freedom of expression\nbut since there are instances where it\nmay, some limitation should be found or implied in the provision or in its\napplication insofar\nas it may be required by a balancing of divergent rights and\ninterests. The express terms of s 34(1)(c) do place important limitations\non its\nscope. First, it provides protection to well-known marks\nonly.\n[31]\nSecond, the prohibited use\nmust be ‘in the course of trade’. This accords for instance with the\nposition in the USA\n[32]\nand the EC.\nAnd then, significantly, the use must be in relation to goods or\nservices.\n[33]\nInteger (f) contains\nan important limitation namely that a defendant may not take ‘unfair\nadvantage’ of the distinctive\ncharacter or repute of the trade mark\n– according to Mostert something akin to misappropriation or unjust\nenrichment.\n[34]\nThis allows for a\nproper balancing of freedoms, rights and interests.\n[23]\tThe word\n‘detrimental’ is not qualified in express terms. However, it is\ninconceivable that\nany\ndetriment could suffice and it is implicit that\ndetriment, in order to be actionable, has to be unfair in the sense that the\nrelief\nsought may not unfairly or unduly encroach on the rights of others\n– including the freedom of expression. There is another\nqualification: The\nlaw, as a general proposition, concerns itself with matters of substance only\nand, accordingly, insubstantial\nprejudice to the trademark owner is not\nenough.\n[35]\nSince neither freedom of\nexpression nor trademark rights are absolute, it will be necessary to consider\nhow they should be balanced.\n[36]\nBefore doing that it is necessary to consider whether the appellant has\notherwise infringed the trade marks in issue.\nInfringement\n[24]\tIt\nis common cause that integers (a) to (e) have been established and all that\nremains is whether the use by the appellant of\nits Black Labour White Guilt mark\nwould be likely to take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the\ndistinctive character or\nthe repute of the Black Label mark. That depends,\namongst other things, on its message, which is a matter of interpretation\nthrough\nthe eyes not only of the typical purchaser of such T-shirt but also\nthrough the eyes of those who are perforce exposed to the purchaser’s\nattire.\n[25]\tSabmark submitted that the message conveyed is that since time\nimmemorial SAB has exploited and still is exploiting black labour\nand that it\nhas or should have a feeling of guilt and that SAB worldwide could not care\nless. That is more or less in accordance\nwith the finding of the court below.\nCounsel for both the appellant and for FXI had some difficulty in explaining\nwhat the message\nwas. Initially appellant’s counsel asked us to ignore\nNurse’s evidence that the intention was to satirise the mark and\nto find\nthat the T-shirt says nothing about SAB but says something in general about\nwhites having exploited black labour. In reply\nhe retracted and adopted\nFXI’s submission which was that it is a complex message which criticises\nthe methods used by SAB to\nmarket its beer by targeting black workers. It should\nbe emphasised that the appellant accepts that it has no ground for attacking\nthe\nemployment practices of SAB. Nowhere on the papers is any case made out of the\nexploitation of black labour. On the contrary,\nin a radio interview shortly\nafter proceedings were instituted, Nurse said that ‘it’s obviously\nnot a statement about\nSAB and their labour practices’.  What Nurse\nintended is not the issue, it is what he in fact said or did. I have only\nreferred\nto this evidence in order to indicate that the appellant does not rely\non a defence akin to truth and public interest or fair comment\nin the law of\ndefamation.\n[37]\n[26]\tI find the\ninterpretation contended for by counsel for the appellant and for FXI strained\nto say the least and that the interpretation\ncontended for by Sabmark to be\nevidently the correct one. That leads to the next question namely whether a\nT-shirt with such a message\nis substantially detrimental to the repute of the\nmarks (I shall return to deal with ‘unfairly’ in due course).\nSabmark\nsubmits that the impression created and left in the mind of the public\nthat SAB has always been and still is guilty of exploiting\nits black labour\nwill, in the light of the history of the country, in all likelihood be seriously\ndamaging to its trade marks. Appellant’s\ncounsel did not attempt to meet\nthe point head-on because it could not be met. It would be fair to pose the\nquestion whether the\nmessage is not likely to create in the mind of consumers a\nparticularly unwholesome, unsavoury, or degrading association with\nSabmark’s\nmarks.\n[38]\nThe\nanswer must be yes. Otherwise put, will anyone who has seen the\nappellant’s T-shirt  be able thereafter to disassociate\nit from\nSabmark’s trade marks?\n[39]\nThe\nanswer must be no.\n[27]\tThe appellant attempted to find the answer to the\nquestion of detriment to repute elsewhere. It contends that SAB has not\nestablished\nthat there has been a loss of sales as a result of the\nappellant’s T-shirt sales but on the other hand it accepts that s 34(1)(c)\ndoes not require proof of actual loss but only the likelihood of\nloss.\n[40]\nIt then contends that\nbecause the appellant is a small concern with relatively limited sales there can\nbe no detriment to the trade\nmarks but counsel simultaneously recognised that\nthe size of an infringing operation is never relevant in determining\ninfringement.\nThere was also a refrain about the need to establish irreparable\nharm for a permanent interdict. Quite a novel proposition.\n[28]\tI therefore\nfind that the message on the T-shirt is materially detrimental to the repute of\nthe trade marks concerned. This leaves\nfor consideration the freedom of\nexpression justification.\nFreedom of\nexpression\n[41]\n[29]\tOne\nshould recognise that in latter-day societies one-liners, sound bytes and SMS\nmessages have become the favourite method of\ncommunication, replacing political,\nreligious and social monographs and tracts. T-shirts fall in the same class and\nprovide a powerful\nmedium for making socio-political comments. As PJ\nO’Rourke once remarked somewhat sardonically –\n‘If Martin\nLuther were a modern ecologist, he would have to nail ninety-five T-shirts to\nthe church door at\nWittenberg.’\n[42]\n[30]\tIt is\nimportant to note what s 34(1)(c) does not forbid and the extent to which it\ndoes not impinge on freedom of expression.\nThe appellant is free to use its\ncaricature in the course of trade subject to a proviso: it may not use it in\nrelation to goods or\nservices.  The appellant may use it in relation to goods or\nservices by placing the caricature on T-shirts, flags or whatever provided\nit is\nnot so used in the course of trade. That is more or less why Canadian courts\nhave found that the caricature of an employer’s\ntrade marks by a trade\nunion during a labour dispute does not amount to trademark\ninfringement.\n[43]\nThe appellant may\ndeclaim the message about black labour and white guilt from rooftops, pulpits\nand political platforms; and it may\nplace the same words (without appropriating\nthe registered mark’s repute) on T-shirts, and sell them. In other words,\nits freedom\nof  expression is hardly affected. A Canadian court has held that\nfreedom of expression is not at all affected if the appellant is\nable to say\nwhat it wants to say in another\nmanner.\n[44]\nUS courts have also held\nthat trade marks need not yield to First Amendment rights under circumstances\nwhere adequate alternative\navenues of communication\nexist.\n[45]\nWhether these statements\nare correct in absolute terms one need not decide since it suffices to say that\nthe availability of adequate\nalternative avenues is a relevant factor to\nconsider in this context.\n[31]\tReturning to the fact that trade marks are\nproperty: Some courts have held that the freedom of expression does not entitle\na\nparty to damage private\nproperty.\n[46]\nNo-one would suggest\nthat painting graffiti on private property (or even public property) is not an\nabuse of free speech. Why should\nit be different simply because the property is\na trade mark? That is not to suggest that puns and the like are not countenanced\nor\nthat trademark owners’ over-sensitivity should be humoured. However,\ncourts are in general not amused by sex- and drug-related\n‘parodies’, even if they are clever or funny, simply because the\nprejudice to the trade mark tends to outweigh freedom\nof\nexpression.\n[47]\nOn the same\nprinciple, unfair or unjustified racial slurs on a trademark owner (even if not\nhate speech or approximating it) should\nin general not be countenanced, more so\nin a society such as ours. The whole point about reputation is that, like\nsanity, it operates\nas a working assumption – to question it is, in\nitself, to devalue it.\n[48]\n[32]\tAnother factor to be taken into account is the predatory intent of the\ndefendant.\n[49]\nT-shirts are\nprimarily a marketable commodity and not only a communication medium. It is not\nthe appellant’s case that  they\nwere used in this case otherwise than in\nthe course of trade. It is also not the appellant’s case that the mark was\nnot used\nin relation to goods. On the contrary, the appellant is in the business\nof marketing clothing. Using well-known marks for the marketing\nof its goods is\nthe whole basis of the appellant’s commercial existence.\n[33]\tPurely\nderisory ‘parody’ of a mark should also not be entitled to\nprotection.\n[50]\nIn this regard\ndefamation principles may be of assistance and matters such as truth, public\ninterest and fair comment may play a\nrole in determining whether the use of a\ncaricature is justified. That is a reason why the nature of the message conveyed\nby the\nT-shirt is important.\nParody\n[34]\tAppellant and FXI submitted that the message was a\nparody of Sabmark’s trade marks and, as such, entitled to freedom of\nexpression protection. In this regard much reliance was placed on American\njurisprudence, more often than not on copyright cases.\nIt is necessary to place\nall this in a proper perspective.\n[35]\tThe leading case on copyright parody\nin the USA is the judgment of the Supreme Court in\nCampbell v Acuff-Rose\nMusic Inc\n.\n[51]\nIt concerned the\nquestion whether a song which parodied Roy Orbison's song, ‘Oh, Pretty\nWoman,’ may be a fair use within\nthe meaning of the US Copyright\nAct.\n[52]\nThe ‘fair use’\nof a copyright work for purposes of criticism or comment is in terms of the\nstatute not infringing use.\nTo determine whether parody falls within the meaning\nof ‘criticism’ the court defined ‘parody’ and it did\nso\nin these terms:\n‘The germ of parody lies in the definition of the Greek parodeia,\nquoted in Judge Nelson's Court of Appeals dissent, as \"a song\nsung alongside\nanother.\" 972 F.2d, at 1440, quoting 7\nEncyclopaedia Britannica\n768 (15th\ned. 1975). Modern dictionaries accordingly describe a parody as a \"literary or\nartistic work that imitates the characteristic\nstyle of an author or a work for\ncomic effect or ridicule,\" or as a \"composition in prose or verse in which the\ncharacteristic turns\nof thought and phrase in an author or class of authors are\nimitated in such a way as to make them appear ridiculous.\"  For the purposes\nof\ncopyright law, the nub of the definitions, and the heart of any parodist's claim\nto quote from existing material, is the use of\nsome elements of a prior author's\ncomposition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that\nauthor's works. If, on\nthe contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on\nthe substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged infringer\nmerely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up something\nfresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's\nwork diminishes\naccordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its\ncommerciality, loom larger. Parody\nneeds to mimic an original to make its point,\nand so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective\nvictims')\nimagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so\nrequires justification for the very act of\nborrowing.’\n[53]\n[36]\tA finding that an allegedly infringing work is a parody does, however,\nnot conclusively establish that its use of the senior\nwork was fair. In order to\ndetermine whether ‘use’ constitutes fair use all relevant factors\nhave to be taken into account,\nincluding those specifically listed in the US\nstatute. One such factor is the purpose and character of the use. For example,\nas\nCampbell\nmakes clear, the use of a copyright work to advertise a\nproduct, even in parody, is treated with less indulgence than the sale of\nthe\nparody itself. (In Canada, on the other hand, parody is not regarded as fair use\nof a copyright work\n[54]\nand there is\nno indication that the position in the UK is any different.) Satire, on the\nother hand, differs from parody since it\ndoes not comment on the senior work and\ncan, therefore, not be considered to be a comment or criticism of the copyright\nwork.\n[55]\nEven then, as a literary\ncritic said  –\n‘a satirical intention, however sincerely felt, does not supersede the\nrequirements of ordinary\ndecency.’\n[56]\nMr Nurse, who should know, ironically enough, described his use as satire and\nnot as parody. Mr Welz, the editor of Noseweek who filed\nan affidavit in support\nof Nurse, was able to give a number of examples of true parody of trade marks as\nused in his publication.\n[57]\nAnd as\ncounsel for FXI accepted during argument, some of the appellant’s other\ncaricatures can be classified as parody and\nothers not.\n[37]\tAs in the case\nof copyright infringement, parody cannot\nper se\nbe a defence against\ntrademark infringement in terms of s 34(1)(c). It is nevertheless a factor like\nthe other factors mentioned\nabove that has to be considered in determining\nwhether a defendant’s use of a mark contrary to the provisions of s\n34(1)(c)\nis constitutionally\nprotected.\n[58]\nA good example of\nfair parody is to be found in the judgment of the Paris Tribunal de Grand\nInstance in\nGreenpeace France v\nEsso\n.\n[59]\nGreenpeace used,\ninstead of the trade mark ESSO, the mark E$$O in a context in which it\ncriticised Esso’s ecological record.\nThe court found that to be\npermissible because Greenpeace should be able to, in its writings or on its\ninternet site, denounce, as\nit considers appropriate to the goal pursued, the\nenvironmental impacts and human health risks caused by certain of Esso’s\nindustrial activities. The court pointed out that this freedom is not absolute\nand it can be subject to the restrictions necessary\nfor the protection of the\nrights of others. Although the mark E$$O refers to Esso’s trademark,\nGreenpeace did not aim to promote\nits products or service commercially but used\nE$$O for polemical purposes. This underscores the view that parody in France is\nnot\na\nper se\ntrade mark defence but that the exception of parody appears\nto be allowed in relation to trade marks provided,\ninter alia\n, that the\nparody was not made for commercial purposes and does not overstep the limits of\nparody.\n[60]\n[38]\tAnother\nillustration is the recent decision in\nMattel Inc v Walking Mountain\nProductions\n.\n[61]\nThe defendant\nproduced artistic photographs which parodied the lifestyle represented by Barbie\ndolls. The court dismissed the dilution\nclaim on the ground that tarnishment\ncaused merely by an editorial or artistic parody which satirizes\nplaintiff’s product or\nits image is not actionable under an anti-dilution\nstatute because of the free speech protection provided by the First\nAmendment.\n[62]\n[39]\tOn the other hand, in\nMutual of Omaha Insurance Co v\nNovak\n,\n[63]\nthe defendant, who\nwas protesting nuclear proliferation, used the trade mark of an insurance\ncompany to make his point on T-shirts\nand coffee mugs. This use was found not to\nbe parody because the defendant was not commenting on the plaintiff’s\ntrade mark\nor business. In\nAnheuser-Busch Inc v Balducci\nPublications\n[64]\nthe defendant\nplaced a fake advertisement, which it thought humorous, in which the\nplaintiff’s beer Michelob was represented\nas an oily product. The intended\nmessage concerned an oil spill which had no connection with Michelob and water\npollution in general.\nNo other justification was proffered for the damaging\nimplication that Michelob contained oil. In balancing the trademark\nowner’s\nrights against that protected under the First Amendment, the court\nfound that the First Amendment defence had to yield to Michelob’s\nrights.\n[40]\tGerman law appears to be similar. According to Nicola Dagg and\nEmma Alanko\n[65]\n–\n‘German legal protection against dilution is subject to the condition\nthat it is \"without due cause\". In applying this provision,\nGerman courts\nattempt to strike a balance between the interests of the trade mark owner and -\nmost usually - the constitutionally\nprotected right to free expression. In\nstriking this balance, German courts have considered:\n1.\tUse of the slogan \"Bild Dir keine Meinung\" (do not form your own opinion),\nwhich alluded to the advertising slogan \"Bild Dir Deine\nMeinung\" (form your own\nopinion) of the well-known tabloid paper\nBild\n(which is also the German\nword for \"picture\" and \"to form\"). This was held to be a critical expression\nwith regard to the quality\nof the\nBild\nnewspaper, which did not amount to\nan infringement.\n2.\tUse of the word Mordoro (Mord = murder) in a mock advertisement for Marlboro\ncigarettes which was included in a non-smokers calendar.\nThis was held not to\ninfringe the Marlboro trade mark because it was protected by the constitutional\nright to freedom of expression.\nOn the other hand, the use of\nthe expression Deutsche Pest was held to be an infringement of the mark Deutsche\nPost because it did\nnot contain a specific criticism of the German post office,\nbut merely amounted to a mindless denigration of the post office.’\n[41]\tIt follows from this analysis that the appellant’s reliance on\nparody as a defence is misconceived. The appellant is using\nthe reputation of\nSabmark’s well-known trade mark, which has been established at\nconsiderable expense over a lengthy period\nof time, in the course of trade in\nrelation to goods to the detriment of the repute of the mark without any\njustification. Such use\nand detriment is unfair and constitutes an infringement\nof the said provision. The appellant’s reliance on the freedom of\nexpression\nis misplaced. It did not exercise its freedom, it abused\nit.\nOrder\n[42]\tThe order issued by the court below was formulated\nin terms too wide. It does not limit the interdict to use in the course of\ntrade\nor on use in relation to goods or services as required by s 34(1)(c). It\nincluded the trade mark ‘Carling Black Label’\nwithin its scope\nalthough not infringed by the appellant. Restraining not only the appellant but\nalso its servants and agents was\nunnecessary and extending the order beyond the\ninfringing mark to ‘any other mark’ was wrong. However, these\naspects\nwere not issues in the appeal and do not affect costs of appeal. The\nappeal stands to be dismissed subject to the indicated changes\nto the\norder.\n[42]\tThe following order issues:\n(a)\tSave as indicated in para (b), the appeal is dismissed with costs,\nincluding the costs of two counsel.\n(b)\tThe order of the court below is amended to read:\n‘The respondent is interdicted from infringing registered trade marks\n91/9236 and 91/9237 of the applicant by using in the course\nof trade and in\nrelation to goods or services the mark depicted in annexure A7.

    "facts": "The appeal concerned a claim of trademark infringement by dilution (tarnishment) under s 34(1)(c) of the Trade Marks Act 194 of 1993. Sabmark, a Dutch subsidiary of the SAB group, owns the well‑known \"Carling Black Label\" mark used on beer bottles. Laugh It Off Promotions CC produced T‑shirts that caricatured the label, replacing \"Black Label\" with \"Black Labour\" and \"Carling Beer\" with \"White Guilt\", and added slogans suggesting Sabmark exploits black labour. The lower court granted an interdict against the appellant, holding that the use was likely to be detrimental to the mark’s repute and not protected by freedom of expression. The appellant appealed, with the Freedom of Expression Institute intervening.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the appellant’s use of the caricature infringes s 34(1)(c) by taking unfair advantage of, or being detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the well‑known \"Carling Black Label\" mark. 2. Whether the appellant’s freedom of expression under s 16(1) of the Constitution can justify the alleged infringement. 3. Whether the provision s 34(1)(c) is constitutionally valid (accepted by the parties).",
    "principles": "The court examined the elements of s 34(1)(c): an unauthorized use in the course of trade of a mark identical or similar to a well‑known mark, where the use is likely to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the mark’s character or repute. It emphasized that the provision must be interpreted in light of constitutional rights, requiring a balancing test between trademark owners’ property rights and freedom of expression. The court discussed anti‑dilution doctrine (tarnishment vs. blurring), the limited scope of parody as a defence, and noted that commercial use that harms a well‑known mark is not protected merely because the expression is satirical. Precedents from South Africa, the UK, the US, Canada, and Germany were referenced to illustrate that trademark rights are not absolute and that freedom of expression does not override them when the use is commercial and detrimental.",
    "application": "The court found that all preliminary elements (unauthorised use, course of trade, similarity, well‑known mark) were satisfied. It concluded that the T‑shirt message was materially detrimental to Sabmark’s repute, portraying the company as exploiting black labour, and that the appellant was exploiting the mark’s reputation for commercial gain. The parody argument failed because the use was commercial, not purely artistic, and no sufficient alternative avenue for expression was required. Balancing the interests, the court held that the infringement outweighed the limited freedom of expression claim, as the detriment to the mark was substantial and the public interest in protecting a well‑known trademark prevailed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The interdict was amended to restrain the respondent from using the specific marks 91/9236 and 91/9237 in the course of trade and in relation to goods or services, and the respondent was ordered to pay the costs of the application, including the costs of two counsel."
