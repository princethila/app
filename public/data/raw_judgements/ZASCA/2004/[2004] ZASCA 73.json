An appeal to\nthe High Court (Pretoria) in respect of each conviction only, not having\nmet\nwith any success, the appeal now serves before this Court with the leave of the\ncourt\na quo\n.\n[2]\tBoth offences were allegedly committed on 24\nOctober 2002 on the N4, a public road.  The state alleged that the appellant\noperated\na bus with registration letters and numbers CWV 330 GP in circumstances\nwhere the permissible maximum axle mass load of the vehicle\nof\n10 200 kg was exceeded in contravention of regulation 234 in that the\nactual mass load was 12 020 kg (Charge 1) and\nthat the permissible vehicle mass\nof the vehicle of 16 700 kg was exceeded in contravention of regulation 236 in\nthat the actual\nmass was 18 260 kg (Charge 2).\n[3]\tAt the commencement of\nthe trial, a document (Exhibit A) was adduced on behalf of the appellant in\nwhich the following formal\nadmissions in terms of\nsection 220\nof the\nCriminal\nProcedure Act 51 of 1977\n, were recorded:\n'1\tOn 25 October 2002 the accused operated a bus with licence number \tCWV\n330 GP on the N4 a public road in the district of Middleburg.\n2\tThe bus was a Mercedes Benz Passenger Coach issued with a \troadworthy\ncertificate authorising the bus to carry 45 passengers \texcluding\nthe driver and\nfitted with pneumatic tyres.\n3\tThe information plate of the bus reflected the following \tinformation\nGross axle mass (front):  6 500 kg\nGross axle mass (rear):  20 500 kg\nGross vehicle mass:  27 000 kg.\n4\tThe notice in terms of\nregulation 245\nreflected the following \tinformation:\n45 seated passengers\n0 standing passengers.\n5\tIt is common cause that the State complied with the provisions of\n\tdetermining the mass of the axles as well as the vehicle, in\nterms of the\nNational Road Traffic Act, 1996\n[Act 93 of 1996] and Regulations, \tsubject to\nparagraph 8.\n6\tIt is common cause that the accused complied with the provisions of \tthe\nNational Road Traffic Act, 1996\nand Regulations, subject to \tparagraph 8.\n7\tThe mass of the front axle according to the mass-measuring bridge \twas 6 240\nkg, the rear axle 12 020 kg and the total mass 18\n260 kg, \twhich is accepted as\ncorrect.\n8\tThe dispute to be determined by the Court is, whether in law, the mass \tof a\nbus (passenger vehicle) must be determined by applying\nthe \tprescribed statutory\nmass as determined in regulation 232 or the \tpermissible maximum masses in terms\nof regulation 234 to regulation\n\t237 by means of determining the actual mass on\na mass-measuring \tbridge.\n9\tIn the premises, the accused also dispute[s]\nmens rea\nin relation to\nthe \targument in paragraph 8.’\n[4]\tSection 75 of the Act empowers the Minister to make regulations\ninter\nalia\nregarding:\n(i)\tThe maximum mass, laden or unladen, of any vehicle ... and the maximum mass\nof any vehicle or any part thereof supported by the\nroad or any specified area\nthereof, when any such vehicle is operated on a public road (ss d);\n(ii)\tThe regulation of the operation and control of any vehicle on a public\nroad, its construction ..., mass ..., body and load and\nthe conditions on which\nit may be used (ss m);\n(iii)\tThe protection of any public road, the mass, tyres and load of any vehicle\nin relation to any specified bridge or ferry,...\n(ss o);\n(iv)\tThe determination of the number of passengers for the transport of which a\ncertain class of motor vehicle is adapted and the\nnumber which may be\ntransported, the general safety, comfort and convenience of passengers carried\non or by such motor vehicle ...\n(ss s);  and\n(v)\tThe additional duties for operators of specified classes of motor vehicles\nor operators engaged in activities which require additional\nsafety measures for\nthe protection of the public (ss z).\n[5]\tRegulation 232 headed ‘Mass of person and\nluggage for determining mass of load’, to the extent here relevant\nreads:\n‘For the purposes of establishing the maximum mass of persons and\nluggage which may be conveyed on a motor vehicle –\n(a)\tthe mass of a person together with his or her personal effects shall,\nsubject to\nthe provisions of regulation 231 be taken as 63 kg; and\n(b)\tin the case of a motor vehicle which is fitted with –\n(i)\ta luggage compartment, the mass of luggage shall be calculated at the\nrate of 100 kg per cubic metre; or\n(ii)\ta roof rack, the mass of luggage shall be calculated at the rate of 75\nkg per square metre of area of the roof rack:'\n[6]\tRegulation 234 headed 'Permissible maximum axle massload of\nvehicle', reads:\n‘1\tNo person shall operate on an public road a minibus, bus, tractor or\ngoods vehicle if the permissible maximum axle massload\nof such vehicle is\nexceeded.\n2\tThe permissible maximum axle massload of a vehicle shall be the least of the\nmass limits determined by –\n(a)\tRegulation 238 (1) in respect of a vehicle fitted with pneumatic tyres\n...\n(b)\tRegulation 239 (1) (a) (ii);\nand\n(c)\tRegulation 240 (a), (b) and (c).’\nRegulation 236 headed\n'Permissible maximum vehicle mass', reads:\n‘1\tNo person shall operate on a public road a minibus, bus, tractor or\ngoods vehicle if the permissible maximum vehicle mass\nof such vehicle is\nexceeded.\n2\tThe permissible maximum vehicle mass of a vehicle shall be the least of the\nmass limits determined by –\n(a)\tthe sum of all the permissible maximum axle massloads and \taxle unit\nmassloads of the vehicle as contemplated in \tregulations\n234 and 235;\n(b)\tregulation 239 (1) (a) (i);\n(c)\tregulation 239 (2);\n(d)\tregulation 239 (3);  and\n(e)\tregulation 241:\nProvided that the permissible maximum vehicle mass of such\nvehicle shall not \texceed 56 000 kilograms.’\n[7]\tIt was\nsubmitted on behalf of the appellant that for the purpose of determining whether\nthose regulations have been contravened\nregulation 232 requires it to be assumed\nthat each passenger on the vehicle at the relevant time weighs no more than 63\nkg, and that\nthe luggage on the vehicle weighs no more than 100 kg per cubic\nmetre of luggage space. The effect of the submission is that regulations\n234 and\n236 will not be contravened if the vehicle is carrying no more than the\npermissible number of passengers (in this case 45)\nirrespective of the actual\nmassload on the axles and the actual mass of the vehicle.\n[8]\tI do not\nagree.  Regulation 232 does not purport to lay down a standard for determining\nthe actual mass of a vehicle, or the actual\nmassload on its axles.  In terms it\npurports only to prescribe a norm for establishing the 'maximum mass of persons\nand luggage'\nthat may be conveyed on a vehicle.  Whether the maximum permissible\nmass of the vehicle or the massload on the axles has been exceeded\nis a question\nof fact, which regulation 232 does not purport to determine.  The purpose of\nregulation 232 is instead to provide a\nnorm for determining whether a vehicle,\nonce it is loaded, will ordinarily fall within certain standards that are\nprovided for in\nthe regulations.\n[9]\tFinally, it was argued on behalf of\nthe appellant that he lacked\nmens rea\n.  The statutory contravention was\nadmitted by him.  No further evidence was adduced by the appellant.  Regulations\n245 (1) (b) (vii)\nand (viii) prohibit the operation on a public road of a\nmini-bus, bus or goods vehicle unless the permissible maximum vehicle mass\nreferred to in regulation 236 and the permissible maximum axle massload referred\nto in regulation 234, expressed in kilograms, is\ndisplayed in a conspicuous\nplace on the vehicle in question.  The appellant, who was a bus operator, should\nhave known, in each instance,\nthe permissible maximum vehicle mass, as also, the\npermissible axle massload permitted by the regulations for a vehicle of the type\ndriven by him.  To suggest in those circumstances, as happened in this case,\nthat the State had failed to establish the requisite\nmens rea\non the part\nof the appellant is wholly untenable.  The trial court as also the court\na\nquo\nquite correctly rejected that argument as being devoid of any substance.\nIn that, neither can be faulted.\n[10]\tIt follows that the appeal must\nfail and in the result it is dismissed\nV M  PONNAN\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nCONCURRING:\nNUGENT  JA\nERASMUS  AJA\n[1]\nPromulgated by the Minister of\nTransport under\nsection 75\nof the\nNational Road Traffic Act 93 of 1996\nin\nGovernment Gazette no R225, GG no 20963 of 17 March 2000.",

    "facts": "The appellant, Cronjé, was convicted in the Magistrates' Court of two contraventions of the National Road Traffic Regulations 234 and 236 after allegedly operating a bus (registration CWV 330 GP) on the N4 on 24 October 2002. The State alleged the bus exceeded the permissible axle massload of 10 200 kg (actual 12 020 kg) and the permissible vehicle mass of 16 700 kg (actual 18 260 kg). The appellant made formal admissions under section 220 of the Criminal Procedure Act, including the measured masses and that the dispute concerned the proper interpretation of Regulation 232 versus the permissible maximum masses in Regulations 234 and 236. The matter was appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal after an unsuccessful High Court appeal.",
    "issues": "The court had to determine (1) whether Regulation 232 sets the standard for ascertaining the actual mass or mass load of a vehicle, or merely provides a norm for calculating the maximum allowable mass of persons and luggage; (2) whether the appellant had the requisite mens rea for the statutory offences, given the statutory requirements to know the permissible maximum masses; and (3) whether the appellant's arguments on the interpretation of the regulations could excuse the conviction.",
    "principles": "Regulation 232 prescribes a standard weight for persons (63 kg) and a method for calculating luggage weight, but does not define the actual mass of a vehicle or its axle loads. Determination of whether the permissible maximum axle massload (Regulation 234) or vehicle mass (Regulation 236) has been exceeded is a factual question. Section 75 of the National Road Traffic Act empowers the Minister to make regulations concerning maximum masses, and Regulations 234 and 236 require operators to know these limits. The legal requirement of mens rea is satisfied where a bus operator should be aware of the applicable maximum masses.",
    "application": "The Court applied the principle that Regulation 232 cannot be used to substitute for actual measured mass. Consequently, the appellant’s contention that the bus complied with the statutory limits based on the assumed passenger weight was rejected. The Court further held that the appellant, as a professional bus operator, was on notice of the maximum permissible masses and therefore possessed the necessary mens rea. The State had met its burden of proof on both the factual over‑loading and the mental element.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The convictions for contraventions of Regulations 234 and 236 were upheld, and the appellant’s arguments on both the interpretation of Regulation 232 and lack of mens rea were rejected."
