Compensation is payable to the owner for the loss of the\nproperty in an amount that, if it cannot be agreed upon,\nis to be\ndetermined by the High Court.\n[3]\tA local authority â or at least one to which the Municipal\nOrdinance (Cape) No 20 of 1974 applies â does not have the power\nto\nexpropriate property except with the prior approval of the provincial\nPremier.\n1\nApproval may be sought from the Premier only after the local\nauthority has exhausted a prescribed procedure. First, it must\nresolve\nby special resolution to expropriate the property.\n2\nThen it must serve on the owner and on the Registrar of Deeds what is\nreferred to as a âpreliminary noticeâ, in which the owner\nis\ninformed of the local authorityâs intention, and is informed that\nany objections to the proposed expropriation may be lodged\nwith the\nTown Clerk within thirty days of the service of the notice.\n3\nUpon expiry of that period the local authority must transmit to the\nPremier any objections lodged by the owner, together with its\ncomments and a copy of the preliminary notice, and must seek the\nPremierâs approval for the proposal.\n4\nIf the Premier approves the expropriation the local authority may\nproceed to expropriate the property in accordance with the Act\n(by\nserving a notice of expropriation on the owner). If the Premier does\nnot approve the local authority must serve a notice on the\nowner and\non the Registrar of Deeds withdrawing its preliminary notice.\n5\n[4]\tIn the present case the appellant â which is a local authority\nthat is subject to the Ordinance â wishes to expropriate a\nfarm\nportion that is owned by the respondent for the purpose of\naccommodating the expansion of an existing informal residential\nsettlement.\nOn 3 May 1999 it decided â by special resolution â to\nexpropriate the property. A preliminary notice was served on the\nrespondent\nand on the Registrar of Deeds in the requisite form, and\nthe respondent was also informed that he would be offered\ncompensation in\nthe sum of R60 000. The respondent lodged an\nobjection to the proposed expropriation on three grounds. He said\nthat he was himself\nplanning to develop the property for medium and\nlow cost housing and that preliminary plans to that end had been\nestablished; he\nquestioned the adequacy of the compensation that was\nto be offered; and he questioned whether the expropriation was truly\nin the\npublic interest.\n[5]\tAbout three months later the respondent received from the\nappellant what purported to be a notice of expropriation together\nwith\na cheque for R60 000. Apparently the appellant had\noverlooked the fact that it had no authority to expropriate without\nthe Premierâs\napproval. When that was brought to its attention by\nthe respondentâs attorney the notice of expropriation was withdrawn\nand the\ncheque was returned.\n[6]\tThe appellant then sought the Premierâs approval. Discussions\nand correspondence ensued but none of that is material to the\nissues\nthat arise in this appeal. It is sufficient to say that before the\nPremier had either approved or disapproved the proposal\n(he had still\nnot done so when the present proceedings were commenced) the\nrespondentâs attorney wrote to the appellant alleging\nthat its\ndecision to expropriate the property (taken by the special resolution\nof 3 May 1999) was unlawful because the respondent\nhad not been given\nprior notice of the appellantâs intention nor an opportunity to\nmake representations before it was taken. The\nappellant was called\nupon to withdraw its preliminary notice, which the appellant declined\nto do, whereupon the respondent applied\nto the Eastern Cape High\nCourt for an order reviewing and setting aside the decision and the\nresultant preliminary notice on the\ngrounds foreshadowed in the\nletter. The application succeeded in the court\na quo\n(Jones J)\nand this appeal is with the leave of that court.\n[7]\tIt has for long been a principle of our law â the common law at\none time being its source\n6\nâ that\nâ\nwhen a statute empowers a public official or body to\ngive a decision prejudicially affecting an individual in his liberty\nor property\nor existing rights,\n7\nthe latter has a right to be heard before the decision is taken (or\nin some instances thereafter â see\nChikaneâs\ncase\n8\nâ¦at 379G), unless the statute expressly or by implication indicates\nthe contrary.â\n9\n[8]\tWhen the Constitution assumed sovereignty the principle was\ninevitably subsumed in constitutional principles regulating the\nexercise\nof public power. For as pointed out in\nPharmaceutical\nManufacturers Association of SA: In re Ex parte President of the\nRepublic of South Africa\n[2000] ZACC 1\n;\n2000 (2) SA 674\n(CC) para 45:\nâ\nIt shifted constitutionalism, and with it all aspects\nof public law, from the realm of common law to the prescripts of a\nwritten constitution\nwhich is the supreme law. That is not to say\nthat the principles of common law have ceased to be material to the\ndevelopment of public\nlaw. These well-established principles will\ncontinue to inform the content of administrative law and other\naspects of public law,\nand will contribute to their future\ndevelopment.  But there has been a fundamental change â¦ Whereas\npreviously constitutional law\nformed part of and was developed\nconsistently with the common law, the roles have been reversed.â\n[9]\tThe principle to which I have adverted is thus inherent in s 33\nof the Constitution (read, at the time that is now relevant,\nwith\nItem 23(b) of Schedule 6), which guarantees, amongst other things,\nthe right to administrative action that is procedurally fair.\nSeen in\nthat context the principle affords a right to be heard in the\ncircumstances that I have described but any purported statutory\nexclusion of that right will necessarily be invalid if it results in\nadministrative action that is procedurally unfair.\n[10]\tThe respondent has not as yet been deprived of his property. It\nis not disputed that ample opportunity has been afforded to\nhim to be\nheard before that will occur, if it occurs at all, bearing in mind\nthat the power to deprive him of his property does not\nlie with the\nlocal authority but with the Premier, and that the Ordinance makes\nexpress provision for the respondent to be heard\nbefore that power is\nexercised. We are thus not called upon to reconsider the question\nwhether, in general, expropriation must be\npreceded by an opportunity\nfor the owner to be heard.\n10\nThe argument before us was rather that the respondent was entitled\nto be heard before the appellantâs decision was taken, because\nthe\neffect of its decision (once conveyed in the preliminary notice) was\nto restrict the use of the property. For once a preliminary\nnotice\nhas been served on an owner and the Registrar of Deeds then the\nOrdinance provides in s 123(4) that\nâ\n(i)\tsuch owner shall not alienate, dispose of, let or\nin any other manner deal with the immovable property concerned unless\nand until\nsuch notice is withdrawn;\nthe Registrar of Deeds shall not register transfer of\n\tthe immovable property concerned to any person except the\n\tmunicipality unless\nand until such notice is withdrawn, and\nany person who demolishes, damages, alters or in any\n\tother manner impairs the immovable property concerned shall be\n\tguilty of an\noffence.â\n[11]\tThere is no suggestion that these restrictions have had any\npractical effect in the present case. It is not suggested that the\nrespondent would have dealt with his property in some way that has\nnow been prevented. Rather, it was submitted on his behalf that\nthe\nrespondent is prejudicially affected by the fact alone that the\nrestrictions exist. Assuming that to be so the question that\nthen\narises is whether the Ordinance validly excludes the right to a\nhearing before those restrictions take effect.\n[12]\tWhether the Ordinance, properly construed, excludes the right to\na prior hearing by necessary implication (for it does not do\nso in\nterms) must necessarily be informed by whether such an exclusion\nwould be procedurally fair in the circumstances (and thus\nconsistent\nwith s 33 of the Constitution),\n11\nbearing in mind that if it is possible to do so a court will avoid\nconstruing legislation into constitutional invalidity.\n12\n[13]\tThe reason that the Ordinance subjects the property to\nrestrictions once the owner has been informed of the intention to\nexpropriate\nis plain enough to see. It is to maintain the\nstatus\nquo\nuntil the Premier has approved or disapproved expropriation.\nIt is to avoid the expropriation meanwhile being frustrated or\nsubverted.\n(A similar restriction that arises in the process for land\nrestitution was said in\nTransvaal Agricultural Union v Minister of\nLand Affairs\n[1996] ZACC 22\n;\n1997 (2) SA 621\n(CC) para 36 to serve a legitimate\npurpose.)\n[14]\tEven when pressed to do so, the respondentâs counsel could not\ntell us in what manner the temporary preservation of the\nstatus\nquo\nwithout a prior hearing operated unfairly upon the owner of\nproperty that was marked for expropriation. Nor can I see how it\nmight\noperate unfairly. (I have already drawn attention to the fact\nthat it had no adverse effect in the present case.) Its effect will\nbe felt only by an owner who would otherwise have acted to alter the\nstatus quo;\nyet it is in precisely such a case that the\nOrdinance and the public interest requires that he be prevented from\ndoing so. It is not\nthe preservation of the\nstatus quo\nitself\nthat prejudices the owner but rather the fact that he might be\ndispossessed of his property, but he has a full opportunity\nto be\nheard before that occurs. The learned judge in the court\na quo\nstated that the respondent was prejudiced procedurally by the\nfailure to hold a hearing before the resolution was taken and the\nnotice\nwas issued but did not expand on why that was so. It also\nneeds to be borne in mind that it is open to the owner in an\nappropriate\ncase (it is difficult to envisage one) to make\nrepresentations to the local authority to withdraw its notice and to\nrescind its resolution\nif, unbeknown to the local authority when the\ndecision was made, there was good reason not to expropriate, and more\nimportantly,\nnot to restrict the use of the property while the merits\nof expropriation were being considered. But once the local authority\nhas\nmarked the property for expropriation I can see no reason why the\nfailure to afford the owner an opportunity to be heard before the\nstatus quo\nis temporarily preserved will operate against him\nunfairly.\n[15]\tClearly the Ordinance does not envisage a hearing before the\nlocal authorityâs decision is taken â that the owner is invited\nto object only after the decision is made necessarily means that no\nobjection before then is contemplated â and this construction\nis\nnot in conflict with the Constitution. In those circumstances the\nappellantâs decision and the consequent preliminary notice\nwere\nlawful and the application ought to have failed.\n[16]\tThe appeal is upheld with costs. The order of the court\na quo\nis set aside and the following order is substituted:\nâThe application is dismissed with costsâ.\n___________________\nR W NUGENT\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nMPATI AP)\nNAVSA JA)\nCLOETE JA)\tCONCUR\nCOMRIE\nAJA\n)\n1\nThe Ordinance refers to the Administrator but in terms of Item\n\t3(2)(b)(ii) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the Republic of\n\tSouth Africa 1996 that is to be construed as referring to the\n\tPremier of the relevant province.\n2\nSection 123(3).\n3\nSection 123(4).\n4\nSection 123(5).\n5\nSection 123(6) of the Ordinance.\n6\nSouth African Roads Board v Johannesburg City Council\n1991\n\t(4) SA 1 (A) 10 G-I\n7\nThe principle was extended in\nTraub, infra,\nto cases in which\n\tan affected person had a legitimate expectation of being heard.\n8\nCabinet for the Territory of South West Africa v Chikane\n1989\n\t(1) SA 349\n(A).\n9\nAdministrator, Transvaal v Traub\n[1989] ZASCA 90\n;\n1989 (4) SA 731\n(A) 748G-H. \n\tSee too\nSouth African Roads Board v Johannesburg City Council\n1991 (4) SA 1\n(A) 10 G-I;\nTransvaal Agricultural Union v\n\tMinister of Land Affairs\n[1996] ZACC 22\n;\n1997 (2) SA 621\n(CC) para 25.\n10\nCf\nPretoria City Council v Modimola\n1966 (3) SA 250\n(A), but\n\tsee MD Southwood\nThe Compulsory Acquisition of Rights by\n\tExpropriation, Ways of Necessity, Prescription, Labour Tenancy and\n\tRestitution\n52-3.\n11\nCf\nTransvaal Agricultural Union v Minister of Land Affairs\n[1996] ZACC 22\n;\n1997\n\t(2) SA 621\n(CC) paras 30 and 31.\n12\nOlitzki Property Holdings v State Tender Board\n2001 (3) SA\n\t1247\n(SCA) para 20;\nNational Director of Public Prosecutions v\n\tMohamed NO\n2003 (4) SA 1\n(CC) para 35;\nZondi v Members of\n\tthe Executive Council for Traditional and Local Government Affairs\n,\n\tunreported Constitutional Court Case 73/03 dated 15 October 2004\n\tpara 102.",

    "facts": "The Buffalo City Municipality, a local authority bound by the Municipal Ordinance (Cape) No 20 of 1974, resolved by special resolution on 3 May 1999 to expropriate a portion of a farm owned by Willy Gauss for the expansion of an informal settlement. A preliminary notice was served on Gauss and the Registrar of Deeds, informing him of the intention to expropriate and offering compensation of R60,000. Gauss lodged objections on three grounds: his own development plans, the adequacy of the compensation, and the public interest of the expropriation. The municipality incorrectly issued a notice of expropriation and a cheque before obtaining the Premier’s approval, later withdrawing them when the error was highlighted. The municipality then sought the Premier’s approval, but before any decision was made, Gauss’s attorney claimed the preliminary notice was unlawful because Gauss had not been given a prior hearing, leading to an application to set aside the notice, which succeeded in the High Court.",
    "issues": "Whether the Municipal Ordinance requires that an owner be given a hearing before the municipality issues a preliminary notice of expropriation, and whether the Ordinance’s restriction on dealing with the property without a prior hearing is constitutionally valid under the right to procedural fairness in section 33 of the Constitution.",
    "principles": "The judgment reaffirmed the common‑law principle that a person affected by a statutory decision affecting his property has a right to be heard before that decision is taken, unless the statute expressly excludes it. This principle is now enshrined in section 33 of the Constitution, guaranteeing procedural fairness in administrative action. The Expropriation Act 63 of 1975 and its extension to local authorities via section 5 were interpreted, as were the specific provisions of the Municipal Ordinance concerning preliminary notices and the restriction on alienating the property pending the Premier’s approval. The court considered the necessity of preserving the status quo and the fact that any adverse effect on the owner would arise only if he attempted to alter the property before the Premier’s decision.",
    "application": "The court examined the purpose of the preliminary notice – to maintain the status quo while the Premier’s approval is pending – and concluded that the Ordinance does not contemplate a hearing before the municipality’s decision to expropriate is made. The restriction on dealing with the property is not unfair because it merely prevents actions that could frustrate the expropriation process and does not, in this case, cause any actual prejudice to the owner. Consequently, the Ordinance does not unconstitutionally exclude the right to a prior hearing, and the municipality’s issuance of the preliminary notice was lawful.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The High Court’s order setting aside the preliminary notice was overturned, and the application to review and set aside the notice was dismissed with costs."
