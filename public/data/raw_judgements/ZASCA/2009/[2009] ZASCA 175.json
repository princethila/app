Leave was granted\non the limited issue of the correctness of\r\nthe remedy afforded to Mr Jan Maake, the fourth respondent, which was\r\nreinstatement\nwith retrospective effect to the time of dismissal.\n[2]\tRegrettably, as will become\r\nevident, this case has had a long and gruelling journey. Counsel for\r\nthe appellant urged us to give\ndue consideration to what he described\r\nas systemic failures. We should all be concerned about the long\r\ndelays in finalising especially\nlabour matters. This is an aspect to\r\nwhich we will revert later in this judgment.\n[3]\tMr Maake was employed by Shoprite\r\nCheckers (Pty) Ltd (Shoprite), a national supermarket chain, in 1972.\r\nAt the material time,\nhe worked for Shoprite as a controller in its\r\ndelicatessen at its Silverton shop. Mr Maakeâs problems leading to\r\nthe litigation\nwhich culminated in the present appeal, started during\r\nthe last quarter of 2000 when, without authority, he consumed food\r\nbelonging\nto Shoprite. The consumption of the food in the\r\ndelicatessen was captured on a surveillance camera and led to\r\ndisciplinary proceedings\nagainst him during November 2000.\n[4]\tAt the disciplinary enquiry Mr\r\nMaake was charged with three instances of misconduct, namely, of\r\neating (on three separate occasions)\nShopriteâs food without\r\nauthorisation, in areas where doing so was prohibited. It is common\r\ncause that Shopriteâs rules prohibited\neating in most of the areas\r\nin the store, including the delicatessen. He was found guilty on all\r\ncounts and his services were terminated\nby Shoprite on 2 December\r\n2000. By this time he had been employed by Shoprite for nearly 30\r\nyears.\n[5]\tIt is unchallenged that, at the\r\ntime of the commission of the offences by Mr Maake, shrinkage at\r\nShopriteâs Silverton store\nwas becoming an increasing problem. The\r\nprecise nature of the shrinkage is not known.\n1\nWe do know that shrinkage at the store had increased from 1.5 per\r\ncent to 4 per cent â the norm for such stores is 1.5 per cent.\nThis\r\nled to the installation of cameras within the store, in an attempt to\r\nidentify those responsible for the shrinkage.\n[6]\tIt is undisputed that, during the\r\nperiod 14 September 2000 â 21 October 2000, the camera\r\ncaptured Mr Maake in the delicatessen\neating items of food. On at\r\nleast two occasions Mr Maake was consuming food that clearly belonged\r\nto Shoprite. The video clips\nshow Mr Maake, on each occasion, taking\r\nan item, first from a table and then off a plate, before consuming\r\nit. Neither the nature\nof the food, nor its value, was established.\n[7]\tMr Maake did not appeal his\r\ndismissal internally.\n[8]\tThe Retail and Allied Workers\r\nUnion (RAWU), of which Mr Maake was a member, referred the matter, on\r\nhis behalf, to the Commission\nfor Conciliation, Mediation and\r\nArbitration (the CCMA) in terms of the Labour Relations Act 66 of\r\n1995 (the LRA), initially for\nconciliation and later for arbitration.\n[9]\tOn 3 April 2001, Commissioner\r\nMathee found that Shoprite had not acted substantively or\r\nprocedurally fairly and ordered Mr Maakeâs\nretrospective\r\nreinstatement to the date of his dismissal.\n[10]\tOn 10 May 2001, Shoprite,\r\ndissatisfied that it had to reinstate Mr Maake, launched a\r\nreview application in the Labour\nCourt in terms of s 145 of the\r\nAct. The Labour Court (Waglay J) handed down its judgment and made\r\nthe following order on 10\nMay 2002:\nâ\nIn the result I am\r\nsatisfied that [Ms Mathee] did in fact commit gross misconduct in\r\nrelation to her duties as arbitrator and the\naward is therefore\r\nliable to be reviewed and set aside.â\nIt took almost a year for this review\r\nprocess to run its course.\n[11]\tThe matter was referred back to\r\nthe CCMA for arbitration afresh. The Commissioner involved in the new\r\narbitration was the second\nrespondent, Commissioner Mbha. Arbitration\r\ncommenced on 13 September 2002 and was finalised on 7 August\r\n2003 â a period\nof almost 11 months. The Commissioner found that Mr\r\nMaake had breached the rule referred to above. He held, however, that\r\ndismissal\nwas not peremptory. He considered, in relation to the\r\noffence in question, that discipline in the workplace had to be\r\nprogressively\nimposed. He took into account Mr Maakeâs clean\r\nlong service record and in the totality of the circumstances held\r\nthat dismissal\nwas too harsh a sanction.\n[12]\tCommissioner Mbha held that Mr\r\nMaake should be given a âsevereâ final written warning, valid for\r\nsix months. Shoprite was\nordered to reinstate Mr Maake. The\r\nreinstatement would take effect from the date of the award and not\r\nfrom the time of dismissal.\n[13]\tThat award was once again taken\r\non review by Shoprite in terms of s 145 of the Act. Shoprite, it\r\nappears, was intent on\nsecuring Mr Maakeâs dismissal. It complained\r\nthat the Commissioner had failed to take into account that\r\nreinstatement would set\na precedent amongst its other employees who\r\nwould, as a consequence, be left with the impression that\r\nunauthorised consumption\nattracted only the sanction of a written\r\nwarning. Shoprite contended that this would lead to inconsistency in\r\napplying discipline\nâ several people had already been dismissed for\r\nthe same offence. It was also submitted that reinstatement would mean\r\nthat Shoprite\nwould be required to continue employing dishonest\r\npeople.\n[14]\tMr Maake, in turn, launched a\r\ncounter application, challenging the finding that he was guilty of\r\nmisconduct and, in addition,\ncomplained about the terms of his\r\nreinstatement and the sanction imposed. During the disciplinary\r\nproceedings Mr Maake had denied\nthat he was the person on the video\r\nclips. During the arbitration proceedings however, Mr Maake\r\nultimately admitted that he was\nthat person. His case then was that\r\nhe had authority to taste food prepared in the delicatessen and was\r\ntherefore only doing his\njob rather than being guilty of misconduct.\r\nIn his counter application he reverted to his earlier denial that he\r\nwas the person\nwho featured in the video clips consuming food. It is\r\nsafe to say that Mr Maake was not contrite.\n[15]\tThe second review application,\r\nonce again, came before Waglay J who encountered problems with the\r\nrecord of the second arbitration.\nHis judgment reflects that there\r\nwas no transcript available. During the hearing before Waglay J, a\r\ntranscript of Commissioner\nMbhaâs handwritten notes was provided\r\nand the parties were agreed that they were a fair reflection of the\r\narbitration proceedings\nand were prepared to have the matter decided\r\non that basis.\n[16]\tOn 13 August 2004, Waglay J,\r\nprobably to the distress of both parties, stated the following in his\r\njudgment:\nâ\nIn this matter having\r\nregard to the summary of evidence I am satisfied that the decision of\r\n[Commissioner Mbha] was not one open\nto be reviewed. However, I am\r\nmindful of the fact that there is discontent on the part of both\r\nparties. Because of the unhappiness\ncompounded by the absence of a\r\nproper record I believe that the best course to follow is to refer\r\nthe matter backâ¦for [it] to\nbe arbitrated afresh before a\r\n[different] Commisioner.â\nYet again, Waglay J ordered that the\r\nmatter be referred back to the CCMA for arbitration before a\r\ndifferent Commissioner. Like the\nfirst, the second review had also\r\ntaken almost one year to be finalised.\n[17]\tShoprite, with the leave of the\r\nLabour Court granted on 18 July 2005,\n2\nappealed that order to the LAC, contending, inter alia, that Waglay J\r\nshould have decided the matter on the transcript presented\nto him. Mr\r\nMaake and his union, both noted a cross-appeal, maintaining that a\r\nreinstatement order retrospective to the time of\ndismissal was\r\njustified.\n[18]\tThe matter was heard by the LAC\r\non 15 September 2006, more than a year after leave was granted.\r\nJudgment was handed down on\n21 December 2007, more than 15\r\nmonths later. Zondo JP, writing for a unanimous court, said the\r\nfollowing about the Labour\nCourtâs approach to the matter (set out\r\nin para 16 above):\nâ\nIf that orderâ¦was\r\ngiven effect to, the new commissionerâ¦would have been the third\r\ncommissioner and the parties and the witnesses\nwho had already\r\ntestified in the previous two arbitrationsâ¦would be called to\r\ntestify and those [who] had given evidence in the\ndisciplinary\r\nhearing would have [been] subjected to cross-examination for the\r\nfourth time on the same events.â\n[19]\tThe learned Judge-President went\r\non to record the following:\nâ\nThe order of the\r\nLabour Court in the second review application was issued on 13\nth\nAugust 2004. That would have been over three and a half years since\r\nthe fourth respondentâs dismissal. What would happen if some\n\nimportant witnesses who had given evidence in the earlier two\r\narbitrations were, for some or other reason, no longer available\nto\r\ngive evidence? What would happen if the unavailability of some or\r\nother important witness who had testified in the earlier arbitrations\n\nled to a result which could not have ensued if he had been available\r\nand had given evidence? Of course, the result could well be\na\r\nmiscarriage of justice.â\n[20]\tThe LAC decided the appeal by\r\nShoprite and the cross-appeal by Mr Maake. It held that the\r\nfinding by Commissioner Mbha\nthat dismissal was not warranted was\r\nunassailable. In respect of Mr Maakeâs submission that a final\r\nwarning as a sanction was\nunjustified, Zondo JP rightly disagreed.\n[21]\tThe LAC held that Commissioner\r\nMbha erred in not ordering retrospective reinstatement. It found that\r\ndenying Mr Maake the benefit\nof reinstatement up to the time of\r\ndismissal would, in the light of the sanction of a final warning, be\r\ntoo punitive. The LAC took\ninto consideration the period of more than\r\ntwo and a half years that had passed from the time of Mr Maakeâs\r\ndismissal up to the\ntime of Commissioner Mbhaâs award and that he\r\nhad been without remuneration for that period. The LAC found that\r\nCommissioner\nMbhaâs failure to order retrospective reinstatement\r\nwas not justifiable, nor reasonable nor rational. In arriving at this\r\ndecision\nthe court took into account Mr Maakeâs length of service,\r\nhis clean disciplinary record and the âindignityâ of the\r\npreceding\ntwo and a half years without income. Zondo JP accepted that\r\nshrinkage was a problem for Shoprite but concluded that, in the\r\ntotality\nof the circumstances, it was unreasonable to deny Mr Maake\r\nthe benefit of his salary for the period between his dismissal and\r\nCommissioner\nMbhaâs award.\n[22]\tIn the result, on 21 December\r\n2007 the LAC made the following order:\nâ\n1.\tThe appeal is\r\ndismissed and the cross-appeal is upheld in part.\n2.\tEach party is to pay\r\nits own costs in regard to the appeal and cross-appeal.\n3.\tThe order of the\r\nLabour Court is set aside and replaced with the following order:\nâ\n(a)\tThe review\r\napplication is dismissed.\n(b)\tThere is to be no\r\norder as to costs.\n(c)\tThe counter-review\r\napplication is granted in part.\n(d)\tThe commissionerâs\r\ndecision not to make the operation of the order of reinstatement\r\n\tretrospective to the date of dismissal\nis hereby reviewed and set\r\naside.\n(e)\tThere is to be no\r\norder as to costs.\n(f)\tThe commissionerâs\r\narbitration award is amended by the addition of the following order\r\nthereto:\nâ(i)\tThe order\r\nreinstating the applicant is to operate with retrospective effect to\r\n\t\tthe date of the applicantâs dismissal.â\nâ\n[23]\tIt is against that order that\r\nShoprite sought leave to appeal from this court. In granting leave\r\nthis court stated:\nâ\nThe appeal is limited\r\nto the correctness or otherwise of the remedy that was allowed to [Mr\r\nMaake].â\nPut differently, the question is\r\nwhether the LAC ought to have substituted the award by Commissioner\r\nMbha in the terms set out in\nthe preceding paragraph.\n[24]\tAs was stated in\nSidumo\r\nv Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd\n2008 (2)\r\nSA 24 (CC) para 55, the starting point in an enquiry such as the\r\npresent is the Constitution. Everyone â employees\nand employers\r\nalike â has a right to fair labour practices (s 23(1)). The primary\r\npurpose of the\nLabour Relations Act\n('LRA') is to give effect to the\r\nfundamental rights conferred by\ns 23.\n[25]\tIn deciding how commissioners\r\nshould approach the task of determining the fairness of a dismissal,\r\nit is important to bear\nin mind that security of employment is a core\r\nvalue of the Constitution which has been given effect to by the LRA.\n3\nThus whilst the decision to dismiss belongs to the employer, the\r\ndetermination of its fairness does not.\n4\nThe statutory scheme requires a commissioner to determine whether a\r\ndisputed dismissal was fair.\n[26]\tNo appeal lies against a decision\r\nof a commissioner. The only remedy available to a party in a matter\r\nsuch as the present one\nis to institute review proceedings in the\r\nLabour Court. Section 158(1)(\ng\n)\r\nconfers on the Labour Court the power to review the performance or\r\npurported performance of any function provided for in the LRA\non any\r\ngrounds that are permissible in law. That power, whilst fairly wide,\r\nis subject to s 145, which to the extent here relevant,\nprovides:\n'(1)\tAny party to a\ndispute\nwho alleges a defect in any arbitration proceedings under the\r\nauspices of the Commission may apply to the Labour Court for an order\n\nsetting aside the arbitration award â\n(a)\twithin six weeks of\r\nthe date that the award was\nserved\non the applicant, ...\n. . .\n(2)\tA defect referred to\r\nin subsection (1), means â\n(\na\n)\tthat\r\nthe commissionerâ\n(i)\tcommitted misconduct\r\nin relation to the duties of the commissioner as an \tarbitrator;\n(ii)\tcommitted a gross\r\nirregularity in the conduct of the arbitration proceedings; or\n(iii)\texceeded the\r\ncommissioner's powers; or\n(\nb\n)\tthat\r\nan award has been improperly obtained.'\nThe general powers of review of the\r\nLabour Court under s 158(1)(\ng\n)\r\nare therefore circumscribed by the provisions of s 145(2) which\r\nprescribe the grounds upon which arbitral awards of CCMA\r\ncommissioners\nmay be reviewed. It follows that a party who wishes to\r\nchallenge an arbitral award under s 145(2) can only do so on one or\r\nmore\nof the grounds envisaged in that section.\n[27]\tSection 145 is now suffused by\r\nthe constitutional standard of reasonableness, the question to be\r\nasked being: 'Is the decision\nreached by the commissioner one that a\r\nreasonable decision-maker could not reach?'\n5\nApplying that standard will give effect not only to the\r\nconstitutional right to fair labour practices, but also the right to\r\nadministrative\naction which is lawful, reasonable and procedurally\r\nfair.\n6\n[28]\tThere may well be a fine line\r\nbetween a review and an appeal, particularly where â as here â\r\nthe standard of review almost\ninevitably involves a consideration of\r\nthe merits. However, whilst at times it may be difficult to draw the\r\nline, the distinction\nmust not be blurred.\n7\nThe drafters of the LRA were clearly alive to the distinction. They\r\naccordingly sought to introduce a cheap, accessible, quick\nand\r\ninformal alternative dispute resolution process. In doing so, appeals\r\nwere specifically excluded. They said:\n'In order for this\r\nalternative process to be credible and legitimate and to achieve the\r\npurposes of the legislation, it must be\ncheap, accessible, quick and\r\ninformal. These are the characteristics of arbitration, whose\r\nbenefits over court adjudication have\nbeen shown in a number of\r\ninternational studies. The absence of an appeal from the arbitrator's\r\naward speeds up the process and\nfrees it from the legalism that\r\naccompanies appeal proceedings. It is tempting to provide for appeals\r\nbecause dismissal is a very\nserious matter, particularly given the\r\nlack of prospects of alternative employment in the present economic\r\nclimate. However, this\ntemptation must be resisted as appeals lead to\r\nrecords, lengthy proceedings, lawyers, legalism, inordinate delays\r\nand high costs.\nAppeals have a negative impact on reinstatement as a\r\nremedy, they undermine the basic purpose of the legislation and they\r\nmake\nthe system too expensive for individuals and small business.\r\nWithout reinstatement as a primary remedy, the draft Bill's\r\nprohibition\nof strikes in support of dismissal disputes loses its\r\nlegitimacy.\nPrior to the\r\nestablishment of the present LAC, it was argued that an appeal\r\nstructure would provide the consistency required to\ndevelop coherent\r\nguidelines on what constitutes acceptable industrial relations\r\npractice. This has not been the case. The LAC's\njudgments lack\r\nconsistency and have had little impact in ensuring consistency in\r\njudgments of the industrial court. The draft Bill\nnow regulates\r\nunfair dismissal in express and detailed terms and provides a Code of\r\nGood Practice to be taken into account by adjudicators.\nThis will go\r\na long way towards generating a consistent jurisprudence concerning\r\nunfair dismissal despite the absence of appeals.'\n8\n[29]\tReturning to the facts of this\r\ncase. In our view, the LAC appears in this particular instance to\r\nhave misconceived the nature\nof its function. The LAC concluded that\r\nWaglay J ought to have finalised the review application instead of\r\nsetting aside the arbitral\naward and remitting the matter to the CCMA\r\nfor a hearing\nde novo.\nOrdinarily, in those circumstances the LAC ought itself to have\r\nremitted the matter to the Labour Court for finalisation. It chose\n\ninstead to finalise the matter itself. Given the inordinate length of\r\ntime that had passed since the dismissal, one would hesitate\nto\r\ncriticise the approach of the LAC.\n[30]\tIn following this approach\r\nhowever, it effectively stepped into the shoes of the Labour Court\r\nand was thus exercising, not\nits traditional appeal powers, but\r\nrather the fairly circumscribed s 145(2) review powers of the Labour\r\nCourt. Its warrant for\ninterference with the award of the arbitrator\r\nwas narrowly confined. Tellingly, Waglay J stated in his judgment\r\nthat [w]hen consideration\nis given to the limited record, the\r\nfindings of the [arbitrator] cannot be faultedâ. This âlimited\r\nrecordâ was ultimately\nthe record on which the matter was decided\r\nby the LAC. Given the decision-making powers conferred upon the\r\narbitrator and having\nregard to the reasoning of the commissioner, it\r\ncannot be said that his conclusion was one that a reasonable\r\ndecision-maker could\nnot reach.\n[31]\tSince the decision in\nSidumo\nduring the first half of 2008 numerous cases have been decided in\r\nlabour courts based on the reasonableness test formulated therein.\n9\nA multitude of arbitrations would no doubt have occurred from that\r\ntime, with commissioners discharging their duties and obligations\nin\r\nterms of the\nLabour Relations Act in\nthe manner carefully and\r\ncomprehensively spelt out by the Constitutional Court in that\r\ndecision. Courts should strive to ensure\na cohesive and consistent\r\njurisprudence which promotes the rule of law. Workers and employers\r\nalike are entitled to certainty in\nthe law as they strive to regulate\r\ntheir relationship in an environment that is often prone to disquiet\r\nand tension.\n[32]\tThere was, in any event, a\r\nfurther limitation on the powers of interference by the LAC.\nSection\r\n193(1)(\na\n)\r\nprovides that if the arbitrator finds that the dismissal is unfair,\r\nhe or she may order the employer to reinstate the employee\nfrom any\r\ndate not earlier than the date of dismissal. Those words clearly\r\nconfer a discretion upon the arbitrator to order reinstatement\nwhich\r\nis not retrospective to the date of dismissal. The LAC in\nNUMSA\r\nv Fibre Flair CC t/a Kango Canopies\n10\nheld that the test for\r\ninterference in a discretion exercised in terms of\ns 193(1)(a)\nis\r\nthat formulated in\nEx Parte\r\nNeethling.\n11\nIt has not been shown in\r\nthis matter that the arbitrator exercised his discretion capriciously\r\nor upon a wrong principle or upon\nany other ground justifying\r\ninterference.\n[33]\tIt is true that the systemic\r\nfailures referred to by Shopriteâs counsel made life difficult for\r\nboth parties. The delays\nin no way serve to detract from the\r\ncorrectness of Commissioner Mbhaâs reasoning. Nor do they bring the\r\nmatter within the terms\nof\ns 145(2)\nof the LRA. It remains eminently\r\nreasonable. It should also be borne in mind that, by the time the\r\nmatter came before the LAC,\nfurther systemic delays had impacted on\r\nboth employer and employee. The answer is to eliminate systemic\r\nfailure rather than punish\neither employers or employees\r\nunjustifiably. By interfering with the decision of the arbitrator,\r\nthe LAC was therefore in effect\nsubstituting its discretion for that\r\nof the arbitrator. That it was not permitted to do.\n[34]\tIt follows that the appeal should\r\nsucceed. Before concluding it is, however, necessary to deal with one\r\nremaining aspect. It\nis the question of the delays in finalising this\r\nmatter. It is necessary to record that neither Mr Maake nor the union\r\nwere represented\nat the hearing of this appeal. Both filed notices to\r\nabide the decision of this court. A period of more than eight years\r\nhas passed\nsince Mr Maake was dismissed. The entire scheme of the LRA\r\nand its motivating philosophy are directed at cheap and easy access\r\nto dispute resolution procedures and courts. Speed of result was its\r\nclear intention. Labour matters invariably have serious implications\n\nfor both employers and employees. Dismissals affect the very survival\r\nof workers. It is untenable that employees, whatever the\nrights or\r\nwrongs of their conduct, be put through the rigours, hardships and\r\nuncertainties that accompany delays of the kind here\nencountered.

    "facts": "Mr Jan Maake had been employed by Shoprite Checkers since 1972 as a delicatessen controller. In late 2000 he was recorded on surveillance footage eating food belonging to the store without authority. The disciplinary enquiry in November 2000 found him guilty of three counts of misconduct and he was dismissed on 2 December 2000 after nearly 30 years of service. The Retail and Allied Workers Union referred the matter to the CCMA. Commissioner Mathee (April 2001) held that Shoprite had acted unfairly and ordered retrospective reinstatement. Shoprite sought a review under s145 in the Labour Court; the court set aside the award (May 2002). A fresh arbitration before Commissioner Mbha (Sept 2002‑Aug 2003) found misconduct but deemed dismissal too harsh, imposing a six‑month written warning and ordering reinstatement effective from the award date only. Shoprite applied for another review; the Labour Court (Waglay J) referred the case back to the CCMA for a de‑novo hearing before a different commissioner (Aug 2004). The Labour Appeal Court (LAC) heard the matter (Sept 2006‑Dec 2007) and ordered retrospective reinstatement with back pay, overturning the Labour Court decision. Shoprite appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The key legal issues were: (1) whether the Labour Appeal Court correctly exercised its powers by substituting the award to give retrospective reinstatement, contrary to the limited s145(2) grounds for review; (2) whether the Commissioner’s discretion under s193(1)(a) was exercised reasonably; (3) the proper application of the constitutional reasonableness test (Sidumo) to the review of an arbitral award; and (4) whether the extensive procedural delays justified a different remedy.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the constitutional right to fair labour practices (s23(1) Constitution) and the primary purpose of the Labour Relations Act to give effect to that right. It emphasised the distinction between an appeal and a review, noting that s145(2) limits review to misconduct, gross irregularity or excess of power by the arbitrator. The reasonableness standard from Sidumo v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd was applied to assess whether the arbitrator’s decision could be reached by a reasonable decision‑maker. Sections 145, 158(1)(g) and 193(1)(a) of the LRA were interpreted to constrain the LAC’s authority to interfere with an arbitrator’s discretion.",
    "application": "The Court found that the LAC had overstepped its statutory mandate by using its appellate function to substitute the award, effectively exercising a s145 review power that was not justified by any of the statutory grounds. The Commissioner’s decision to impose a written warning rather than dismissal was deemed reasonable given Maake’s long service and clean record. The Court held that the procedural delays, while regrettable, did not constitute a ground for overturning the arbitrator’s discretion. Consequently, the LAC’s order for retrospective reinstatement was set aside.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld Shoprite’s appeal. The order of the Labour Appeal Court was substituted: both the appeal and the cross‑appeal were dismissed, each party to bear its own costs, and the Labour Court’s order was set aside. The final order reflected that no reinstatement with retrospective effect was granted and that the matter was concluded without further costs."
