An action was brought\r\nagainst the appellant by\nthe Claasen Family Trust (the Trust) for the\r\nrecovery of damages alleged to have been sustained. The Trust alleged\r\nthat the appellantâs\nemployee had convinced it to invest an amount\r\nof R1 020 000 in an investment product known as âRMB\r\nGuaranteed Cashflow\nInvestmentâ (the product) by representing that\r\nthe capital amount invested in the product would be guaranteed and\r\nrefunded at\nthe end of the investment period. This however was not\r\nthe case. As it turned out, so it was alleged, the capital was placed\r\nat\nrisk and could not be repaid on maturity. The appellant settled\r\nthe claim by paying the Trust an amount of R585 686.56.\n[2]\tThe appellant, having settled\r\nthe claim, instituted action in the High Court, Pretoria against the\r\nfour respondents in the proceedings\nthat are the subject of this\r\nappeal, alleging that they were joint wrongdoers, and sought to\r\nrecover a contribution from one or\nmore of the respondents. The\r\nappellant pleaded that the first and second respondents had devised,\r\ndesigned and developed the product\nand had furthermore utilized the\r\nservices of the third and fourth respondents to promote and market it\r\nto members of the public,\nincluding its employees. The respondents\r\nare alleged to have caused the appellantâs employee to make false\r\nor incorrect representations\nabout the true nature and\r\ncharacteristics of the product to members of the public.\n[3]\tThe respondents excepted to\r\nthe appellantâs particulars of claim on the basis that no cause of\r\naction was disclosed. The court\nbelow upheld the exception. This\r\nappeal is before us with the leave of that court.\n[4]\tThe appellantâs claim is\r\nfounded upon s 2(12) read with s 2(6) of the Apportionment\r\nof Damages Act 34 of 1956, which\npermits a joint wrongdoer to recover\r\na contribution from another joint wrongdoer in certain circumstances.\r\nThis appeal turns on\nthe interpretation of s 2 of the Act and,\r\nin particular, it raises the question whether the appellant was\r\nobliged to give\nnotice in terms of s 2(2), or obtain leave of\r\nthe court in terms of s 2(4), as a precondition to instituting\r\naction against\nthe respondents. It is convenient at this stage to set\r\nout the relevant provisions of s 2.\n[5]\tSection 2(1) is a guiding\r\nprinciple to have a unitary action. It allows for an action to be\r\ninstituted against joint wrongdoers\nin the following terms:\n'(1)\tWhere it is\r\nalleged that two or more persons are jointly or severally liable in\r\ndelict to a third person (hereinafter referred\nto as the plaintiff)\r\nfor the same damage, such persons (hereinafter referred to as joint\r\nwrongdoers) may be sued in the same actionâ.\nSection 2(2) allows for joint\r\nwrongdoers who have not been sued in an action to be alerted to their\r\npotential liability, whether\nby the plaintiff or by a defendant, so\r\nas to enable them to intervene in the proceedings, in the following\r\nterms:\n(2)\tNotice of any\r\naction may at any time before the close of pleadings in that action\r\nbe given â\nby the plaintiff;\nby any joint\r\n\twrongdoer who is sued in that action,\nto any joint\r\nwrongdoer who is not sued in that action, and such joint wrongdoer\r\nmay thereupon intervene as a defendant in that actionâ.\n[6]\tThe Act recognises the\r\npotential prejudice to a joint wrongdoer who is not joined in an\r\naction and in this regard s 2(4)\nprovides a sanction if the\r\nnotice referred to in s 2(2) has not been given to a joint\r\nwrongdoer as follows:\n(4)(a)\tIf a joint\r\nwrongdoer is not sued in an action instituted against another joint\r\nwrongdoer and no notice is given to him in\nterms of paragraph (a) of\r\nsubsection (2), the plaintiff shall not thereafter sue him except\r\nwith the leave of the court on good\ncause shown as to why notice was\r\nnot given as aforesaid.\n(b)\tIf no notice is\r\nunder paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (2) given to a joint\r\nwrongdoer who is not sued by the plaintiff, no\nproceedings for a\r\ncontribution shall be instituted against him under subsection (6) or\r\n(7) by any joint wrongdoer except with the\nleave of the court on good\r\ncause shown as to why notice was not given to him under paragraph (b)\r\nof subsection (2)â.\n[7]\tProvision is made for a\r\ncontribution to be claimed by one joint wrongdoer against another, so\r\nfar as it is material to this\nappeal, by s 2(12) read with\r\ns 2(6). The relevant portion of s 2(12) provides as\r\nfollows:\nâ\n(12) If any joint\r\nwrongdoer agrees to pay to the plaintiff a sum of money in full\r\nsettlement of the plaintiffâs claim, the provisions\nof subsection\r\n(6) shall apply\nmutatis\r\nmutandis\nas if judgment had been given by a competent court against such joint\r\nwrongdoer â¦â.\nSection 2(6) in turn, provides as\r\nfollows:\nâ\nIf judgment is in\r\nany action given against any joint wrongdoer for the full amount of\r\nthe damage suffered by the plaintiff, the\nsaid joint wrongdoer may,\r\nif the judgment debt has been paid in full, subject to the provisions\r\nof paragraph (b) of subsection\n(4), recover from any joint wrongdoer\r\na contribution in respect of his responsibility for such damage of\r\nsuch amount as the court\nmay deem just and equitable having regard to\r\nthe degree in which that other joint wrongdoer was at fault in\r\nrelation to the damage\nsuffered by the plaintiff and to the damages\r\nawarded: â¦â.\n[8]\tAs appears from subsection\r\n(6), the right that is accorded to one joint wrongdoer to recover a\r\ncontribution from another is\nexpressly stated to be âsubject to the\r\nprovisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (4)â. The essence of the\r\nrespondentsâ exception\nwas that the appellant had not alleged that\r\nit had given them as defendants notice of the first action as\r\nrequired by s 2(2)\nof the Act, nor had it obtained leave of the\r\ncourt in terms of s 2(4), before the proceedings against them\r\nwere instituted.\nThey thus contended that the appellant was precluded\r\nfrom instituting the action.\n[9]\tBefore us counsel for the\r\nappellant disputed that construction of the relevant subsections.\r\nDirecting his argument to the phrase\n'where it is alleged' in s 2(1)\r\nhe contended that the appellant was not obliged to give notice to the\r\nrespondents of the Trustâs\naction, nor to have the leave of the\r\ncourt, since it had not been alleged in the Trustâs action that the\r\nrespondents were joint\nwrongdoers. In that regard he relied upon what\r\nwas said in\nBecker v\r\nKellerman\n,\n1\nwhich held that\nthe phrase âwhere it\r\nis allegedâ in s 2(1) must be interpreted as âwhere it is\r\nalleged in an actionâ.\n[10]\tIn that case Mashigo, an\r\nemployee of Becker had caused damage to Kellerman's motor vehicle in\r\na road accident. Kellerman sued\n Mashigo for damages caused in the\r\ncollision.  Thereafter and without notice or the leave of the court\r\nhe instituted a claim for\na contribution against Becker, who had not\r\ncaused the accident and was sued on the basis of vicarious liability.\r\n Becker raised\na special plea that Kellerman could not sue him\r\nbecause he had failed to give him notice in terms of s 2(2) or\r\nobtain the\nleave of the court in terms of s 2(4).\n[11]\tThe court dismissed the\r\nspecial plea. Much of the judgment in that case is taken up with the\r\nquestion whether a person who\nis vicariously liable for the conduct\r\nof another is a joint wrongdoer for the purposes of the Act. Having\r\nfound that such a person\nis indeed a joint wrongdoer, the court\r\nturned to the question\nâ\nwhether or not\r\nall joint wrongdoers who are in fact jointly or severally liable in\r\ndelict for the same damage, are joint wrongdoers\nfor the purposes of\r\nsubsections (2) and (4) of section (2)\nâ\n2\n(our translation).\nIt held that Becker was not such\r\na joint wrongdoer, with the result that Kellerman was entitled to sue\r\nhim without the leave of\nthe court, notwithstanding that Becker had\r\nnot been given notice of the earlier action.\n[12]\tThe reasoning of the court\r\nin\nBecker v Kellerman\n,\r\nas we understand it, was that âjoint wrongdoersâ as contemplated\r\nby the relevant subsections were confined to persons who\nhad been\r\nalleged to be joint wrongdoers in the initial action. Absent such an\r\nallegation in the course of the initial action, the\nperson who was\r\nsubsequently sued was not a âjoint wrongdoerâ and did not fall\r\nwithin the terms of subsection (4)(a). Because\nthere had been no\r\nallegation in the action against the employee that Becker was a joint\r\nwrongdoer, so the court held, he was not\na âjoint wrongdoerâ as\r\ncontemplated by subsection 4(a).\n3\n[13]\tThe court below sought to\r\ndistinguish\nBecker v\r\nKellerman\nbut we do\r\nnot think this case is materially distinguishable. Quite clearly the\r\ncircumstances in which the issue arose in that case\ndiffer from those\r\nof the present case. But if such an allegation is indeed a\r\nprerequisite to a person being a âjoint wrongdoerâ\nfor purposes\r\nof subsection 4(a) â as was found in\nBecker\r\nv Kellerman â\nthen\r\nit seems to us that that must apply as much to subsection 4(b). And\r\nif that is so, it is fatal to the respondentsâ case,\nbecause there\r\nis no suggestion that in the action by the Trust against the\r\nappellant it was alleged by anyone that the respondents\nwere joint\r\nwrongdoers (and the case was argued on the basis that no such\r\nallegation had been made).\n[14]\tBut we disagree with the\r\nconstruction that was placed upon the Act in that case. In our view\r\nthe court in\nBecker v\r\nKellerman\naccorded\r\nundue significance to the use of the word âallegedâ in s 2(1).\r\nTo the extent that the subsection defines âjoint\nwrongdoersâ, it\r\ndefines the term to mean âtwo or more persons [who are] jointly or\r\nseverally liable in delict to a third person\nfor the same damageâ.\n4\nWe do not think that the phrase âwhere it is allegedâ purports to\r\nsuggest that the term is confined to persons who have been\nalleged at\r\nsome time to be joint wrongdoers. The purpose of the phrase is no\r\nmore than procedural. Subsection (1) creates a procedural\nframework\r\nfor the initiation of the unitary process in which the respective\r\nrights and obligations of the plaintiff and all concurrent\nwrongdoers\r\nwill be determined. It could hardly have been phrased so as to refer\r\nto persons who are joint wrongdoers in fact when\nthe very question to\r\nbe determined in the proceedings that it authorises is whether or not\r\nthey are indeed âjoint wrongdoersâ.\nReferences to âjoint\r\nwrongdoersâ in the remaining subsections are at times a reference\r\nto persons who are alleged to be joint\nwrongdoers, and at other times\r\na reference to persons who are joint wrongdoers in fact, but that is\r\nagain dictated by the same\nprocedural reasons.\n5\nBut we cannot agree that the determination of whether a person is or\r\nis not a joint wrongdoer for purposes of those subsections\nis whether\r\nor not an allegation to that effect was made in the original action.\r\nThat construction seems to us not only to strain\nthe language but, as\r\npointed out by the court below, it would also lead to absurdities\r\nwhen applied to s 2 as a whole.\n[15]\tWe agree with the court\r\nbelow that the clear purpose of the Act is to avoid a multiplicity of\r\nactions arising from a single\nloss-causing event. The scheme of the\r\nAct contemplates a single determination of liability by multiple\r\nwrongdoers and the apportionment\nof liability amongst them in single\r\nproceedings. Thus a plaintiff who alleges that two or more persons\r\nare liable for the damage\nthat is in issue then he or she is\r\npermitted by s 2(1) to sue them all in the same action. A\r\ndefendant who alleges that another\nperson is also liable to the\r\nplaintiff is capable of joining him or her in the proceedings under\r\nRule 13 of the Uniform Rules.\nAnd if the plaintiff and the defendant\r\nchoose not to join that person in the action, then that person must\r\nat least be given the\nopportunity to intervene by being notified of\r\nthe action. The clear purpose of subsections 4(a) and (b) is to\r\nencourage the resolution\nof all claims in single proceedings by\r\nbarring further proceedings against parties who have not been given\r\nsuch notice (except\nwith the leave of the court).\n[16]\tThat seems to us to be the\r\nplain meaning of the language of the various subsections. The\r\nlanguage is also consistent with the\nmanner in which it was applied\r\nin\nSouth African\r\nRailways and Harbours v South African\nStevedore Services,\n6\nwhere the phrase âjoint wrongdoersâ was used within the context\r\nof the Act in different senses, and in\nWapnick\r\nv Durban City Garage\n,\n7\nas well as in\nLincoln v\nRamsaran\n.\n8\nBoth the latter cases dealt with applications to the court for leave\r\nto institute action for a contribution in terms of s 2(4)\nof the\r\nAct as no notice of the original action had been given to the persons\r\nsubsequently alleged to be joint wrongdoers. No allegation\nin either\r\nmatter had been made that the person from whom the apportionment was\r\nsought was a joint wrongdoer. The merits of each\napplication were\r\nconsidered and the court held that leave of the court had to be\r\nobtained before such wrongdoers could be sued\nregardless of the fact\r\nthat no allegation had been made in the original action that they\r\nwere joint wrongdoers. In the\nLincoln\ncase the application\r\nwas granted, whilst in\nWapnick\nleave was refused as\r\nthe applicant had failed to show good cause.\n[17]\tIn our view the finding in\nBecker v Kellerman\nthat the provisions of subsection 4 apply only to a person who has\r\nbeen alleged in the original proceedings to be a joint wrongdoer,\nis\r\ninconsistent with the scheme of the Act and undermines the object and\r\npurpose thereof. The conclusion is illogical and was in\nour\r\nrespectful view erroneous. It follows therefore that the reliance by\r\nthe appellant on\nBecker\r\nv Kellerman\nis\r\nmisplaced. In the absence of notification to the respondents of the\r\nearlier action, as required by subsection 2, and without\nthe leave of\r\nthe court, the appellant was precluded by subsection 4(b) from\r\ninstituting the present action. In those circumstances\nthe exception\r\nwas correctly upheld.\n[18]\tIn so far as the form of the\r\norder issued by the court below is concerned, it was accepted by\r\ncounsel for all the parties that\nthe appellant ought to have been\r\npermitted to amend its particulars of claim to remedy the defect if\r\nit is capable of doing so.\nThe order will be amended accordingly.\n[19]\tIn the result the following\r\norder is made:\n(a)\tSave as set out in paragraph\r\n(b) the appeal is dismissed with costs.\n(b)\tThe order of the court below\r\nis varied by the addition of the following sentence, the date\r\nreferred to being a reference to\nthe date upon which this order was\r\nsubstituted for the order of the court below:\n'The plaintiff is granted leave\r\nto amend its particulars of claim within 21 days of the date of this\r\norder.'\n___________________\nN Z MHLANTLA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\n__________________\nR.

    "facts": "The Claasen Family Trust invested R1,020,000 in an RMB Guaranteed Cashflow Investment on representations by an ABSA employee that the capital would be guaranteed. The investment failed and the capital was at risk. The Trust sued ABSA Brokers, which settled the claim for R585,686.56. ABSA then instituted proceedings against four respondents, alleging they designed the product and used the third and fourth respondents to market it, thereby causing the employee to make false representations to the public.",
    "issues": "The main issue was whether ABSA was required under section 2 of the Apportionment of Damages Act 34 of 1956 to give notice to the respondents pursuant to s2(2) or to obtain leave of the court under s2(4) before instituting a contribution claim against them. A subsidiary issue concerned the interpretation of the phrase “where it is alleged” in s2(1) and whether a party must be alleged as a joint wrongdoer in the original action to trigger the notice/leave requirements.",
    "principles": "Section 2 sets out a procedural framework for suing joint wrongdoers in a unitary action, requiring notice to undisclosed joint wrongdoers (s2(2)) and imposing a sanction (s2(4)) if notice is not given unless leave is obtained. The court examined the precedent Becker v Kellerman, which limited the notice requirement to parties previously alleged as joint wrongdoers, but rejected that narrow construction. It held that the phrase “where it is alleged” is merely procedural and that the purpose of the Act is to avoid multiple actions arising from the same loss, requiring notice or leave irrespective of prior allegation. Other cases (Railways v Stevedore Services, Wapnick v Durban City Garage, Lincoln v Ramsaran) were cited to support the broader interpretation.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that the respondents were joint wrongdoers within the meaning of the Act. ABSA had neither given the required notice under s2(2) nor obtained leave under s2(4) before commencing the contribution claim. Consequently, under s2(4)(b) the action was pre‑cluded, and the respondents’ exception was correctly upheld. The court nevertheless allowed ABSA leave to amend its particulars of claim to cure the defect.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The order of the lower court was varied to grant the plaintiff leave to amend its particulars of claim within 21 days of the date of the order."
