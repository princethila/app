The present respondent, Century City\nProperty Ownersâ Association,\na section 21 company, is the trade\nmark owner. There are also ancillary or alternative issues, namely\npassing-off and the question\nwhether the corporate name of the\nappellant, the alleged infringer, is undesirable in terms of the\nprovisions of\nsection 20\nof the\nClose Corporations Act 69 of 1984\n. \nThe court below (Davis J) granted all the relief sought by the\nAssociation and this appeal is with its leave.\n[2]\nCentury\nCity is a huge commercial and residential âdevelopmentâ on some\n300 hectares of land next to the N1, the main road leading\nnorthwards\nfrom Cape Town. It falls within the municipality of the City of Cape\nTown and, more particularly, the suburb Montague\nGardens. The\ndevelopment began in earnest in 1997 and, according to the\nAssociationâs founding affidavit, it was always the intention\nthat\nCentury City would be one development, independently functioning and\noperating, providing a cross pollination of services and\nindustries\nto the owners and tenants within Century City. The land was in due\ncourse enclosed and a business park, a mid to upper\nechelon housing\ndevelopment and office blocks were erected. A road, called Century\nCity Boulevard, was constructed which serves as\nthe main artery to\nthe development, and a theme park, Ratanga Junction, and the âfamousâ\nCanal Walk Shopping Centre were erected.\nThe trade mark registrations\n[3]\tThe Association, a non-profit home\nownersâ association, holds a number of trade marks in different\nclasses, some consisting\nof the name âCentury Cityâ and others of\ndevices (more correctly, word-and-device marks) containing this name\nmark and interlocking\nCs.\nThe\nAssociation did not apply for these trade marks â they were\nassigned to it by the developer of Century City.\nFor\na reason that can only be described as baffling the trade mark\nregistrations on which the Association relied in its notice of\nmotion\nappear for the first time at the end of the papers whereas other\nregistrations, on which no reliance was placed, were attached\nto the\nfounding papers.\n[4]\tThe argument in this court\nfocused on the infringement of the mark âCentury Cityâ registered\nunder registration number 1997/14283\nin class 42 (as it then existed)\nfor\nâ\nRetail,\nwholesale, marketing, distribution, hiring, leasing, mail order and\nmerchandising services of all kinds; providing of food\nand drink\nincluding bars, bottle stores and restaurants, snack bars,\ncafeterias, roadhouses, canteens, fast-food outlets; catering\nservices, cocktail lounge services; temporary accommodation, hotels,\nhotel management; motels, tourists hostels, accommodation bureaux\nand\nservices all for reserving accommodation at hotels, boarding houses\nand the like; arranging, hiring and providing facilities\nfor\nexpositions, exhibitions and the like; services ancillary to the\naforegoing.\nâ\n[\n5]\tThe\nremaining name marks that were the subject of the application are\nthese:\n1997/14280 CENTURY CITY in class 35\n\tin respect of\nâ\nadvertising\nand business services, including, but not restricted to township and\nresidential development, management services, organisation\nand\nconsultation, evaluation services, import and export services,\npromotion, publicity, business research, planningâ;\n1997/14281 CENTURY CITY in class 36\n\tin respect of\nâ\ninsurance;\nfinancial affairs; monetary affairs; real estate affairs, including\nproperty, township and residential development, real\nestate\nappraisal, estate agencies, real estate management, leasing of real\nestateâ; and\n1997/14282 CENTURY CITY in class 41\n\tin respect of\nâ\neducation;\nproviding of training; entertainment; including but not restricted to\nservices relating to cinemas, theme parks and casinos\nand the\nprovision of facilities therefor; sporting and cultural activities;\nservices ancillary to the aforementioned.â\n[6]\tThe device marks that were relied\non in the notice of motion are all for the same device. They cover\nthe same classes and have\nthe same specifications as the name marks.\nThe alleged infringing acts\n[7]\tThe\nTrade Marks Act 194 of 1993\nrecognizes three types of trade mark infringement. The first is the\nunauthorized use in the course of trade in relation to goods\nor\nservices in respect of which the trade mark is registered, of an\nidentical mark or of a mark so nearly resembling it as to be\nlikely\nto deceive or cause confusion\n(s 34(1)(a)).\nThe second is the\nunauthorized use of a mark, which is identical or similar to the\ntrade mark registered, in the course of trade\nin relation to goods or\nservices which are so similar to the goods or services in respect of\nwhich the trade mark is registered,\nthat in such use there exists the\nlikelihood of deception or confusion\n(s 34(1)(b)).\nThe third,\ncommonly referred to as dilution, does not figure in this case.\n[8]\tThe appellant (the respondent in\nthe court below), Century City Apartments Property Services CC, used\nthe name âCentury City\nApartmentsâ as its âbrandâ or business\nname. This is apparent from its promotional material and, for\ninstance, its entry in\nthe telephone directory. Its internet domain\nname is centurycityapartments.co.za. The Associationâs case was\nthat the use of the\ncorporate name, the brand name, and the domain\nname infringed all the mentioned name and device marks even though it\ndid not use\nany device mark or anything approximating one.\n[9]\tThe judgment of the court below\naccepted the submission without distinguishing between the name marks\nand the device marks and\nwithout considering the nature of the\nappellantâs services. And in spite of counselsâ assumption to the\ncontrary the court order,\nfor a reason not explained, incorporated\nonly the class 42 mark of the name marks mentioned although it\ncovered all the device marks.\nAssessment of trade mark\ninfringement\n[10]\tThe first issue to consider is\nthe identification of the allegedly infringing mark.  It is trite law\n(in spite of allegations\nto the contrary in the Associationâs\naffidavits and some submissions in the Associationâs heads of\nargument) that a person may\nuse a trade mark otherwise than as a\nbadge of origin and that the appellantâs use of the name Century\nCity in a descriptive manner\ncould not amount to infringement. See\nVerimark (Pty) Ltd v BMW AG;\nBMW AG v Verimark (Pty) Ltd\n2007 (6) SA 263\n(SCA), and\nCommercial\nAuto Glass (Pty) Ltd v BMW AG\n2007 (6) SA 637\n(SCA);\n[2007] 4 All SA 1331\n(SCA). The appellant did\nuse the name Century City in a descriptive manner in its advertising\nmaterial but its use of the name as\na brand, corporate or domain name\nis nothing but trade mark use and the faint argument to the contrary\nstands, accordingly, to be\nrejected.\n[11]\tThe second issue is whether the\nappellantâs use was in the course of trade and, related to that,\nwhether its services fell\nwithin the said classes as defined. Because\nthe appellant acted as an accommodation agent for reserving\naccommodation in Century\nCity its activities fell within class 42.\nThey also fell within class 36 to the extent that this class covered\nestate agencies, real\nestate management and leasing of real estate,\nand class 35 in relation to management services. There was no\nevidence that the appellant\nused the mark in connection with any\nservices covered by class 41 as defined above.  There was also no\nevidence or argument in relation\nto the question whether the\nappellantâs services were so similar to the services covered by\nthis class that there was a likelihood\nof deception or confusion\nduring use. This conclusion makes consideration of\ns 34(1)(b)\nunnecessary.\n[12]\tThe next issue is whether the\nmarks âCentury Cityâ and âCentury City Apartmentsâ are, in\nthe wording of\ns 34(1)(a)\nâidenticalâ. I think not. As the\nEuropean Court of Justice indicated,\nâ\n[t]he\ncriterion of identity of the sign and the trade mark must be\ninterpreted strictly. The very definition of identity implies that\nthe two elements compared should be the same in all respects\nâ\n.\n(\nLTJ\nDiffusion SA v Sadas Vertbaudet SA\n[2003] ETMR 83\n(European Trade Mark Reports) para 50.) This is,\nhowever, subject to the proviso that minute and wholly insignificant\ndifferences\nare not taken into account (\nReed\nExecutive Plc & Ors v Reed Business Information Ltd & Ors\n[2004] EWCA Civ 159\n;\n[2004]\nRPC 40\npara 29). In other words, the\nde\nminimis\nprinciple applies.\n[13]\tThat is not the end of the\ninquiry because if the appellantâs brand name were to be\nconfusingly similar to the registered mark\n(âbe likely to deceive\nor cause confusionâ) it infringes. I am satisfied that the\nappellantâs brand name, in spite of the addition\nof the word\nâapartmentsâ, is confusingly similar to Century City. The point\nis well illustrated by the facts in\nCompass\nPublishing BV v Compass Logistics Ltd\n[2004] EWHC 520\n(Ch). The registered mark was the word âCompassâ\nin relation, in simplified terms, to computer and computer related\nservices.\nThe defendant traded in the same fields under the name\nCompass Logistics. After pointing out that the two marks were not\nidentical\nin the light of\nLTJ\nDiffusion SA v Sadas Vertbaudet SA\nthe court proceeded to consider whether they were confusingly\nsimilar. Laddie J said this (paras 24-25):\nâ\nThe\nlikelihood of confusion must be appreciated globally, taking account\nof all relevant factors. It must be judged through the eyes\nof the\naverage consumer of the goods or services in question. That customer\nis to be taken to be reasonably well informed and reasonably\ncircumspect and observant, but he may have to rely upon an imperfect\npicture or recollection of the marks. The court should factor\nin the\nrecognition that the average consumer normally perceives a mark as a\nwhole and does not analyse its various details. The visual,\naural and\nconceptual similarities of the marks must be assessed by reference to\nthe overall impressions created by the marks bearing\nin mind their\ndistinctive and dominant components. Furthermore, if the association\nbetween the marks causes the public to wrongly\nbelieve that the\nrespective goods come from the same or economically linked\nundertakings, there is a likelihood of confusion.\nApplying\nthose considerations to the facts of this case, there can be little\ndoubt that a likelihood of confusion exists between the\nDefendant's\nuse of the sign or mark âCOMPASS LOGISTICS\" in relation to its\nbusiness consultancy services and the notional\nuse of the mark\nâCOMPASSâ used in relation to business consultancy services,\nincluding those in relation to which the Defendant\nspecialises. The\ndominant part of the Defendant's mark is the word âcompassâ. For\nmany customers, the word \"logistics\"\nwould add little of\nsignificance to it. It alludes to the type of area of consultancy in\nwhich the services are carried out.\nâ\n[14]\tThis means\nthat one has to assume reasonable notional use by a trade mark owner\nof the name Century City\nfor\npurposes of providing services for reserving and maintaining\naccommodation at apartments. The appellantâs use of Century City\nApartments would to my mind have given rise to the likelihood of\nconfusion. I therefore conclude that the appellantâs use of its\nbrand name infringed the mentioned trade mark registration. The same\napplies to the use of its domain name. This does not mean that\nthe\nregistration remained unimpeachable. I shall revert to this issue.\n[15]\tI do not agree with the high\ncourt that this conclusion applies to the appellantâs corporate\nname âCentury City Apartments\nProperty Services CCâ. It is in my\nview materially different from the trade mark Century City.  I can do\nno better than to refer\nto the facts in\n10\nRoyal Berkshire Polo Club Trade Mark\n[2001] RPC 643\nesp at 653. The question was whether this mark was\nconfusingly similar to the well-known Polo mark. The court held that\nit was not\nbecause it did not capture the distinctiveness of the\ntrade mark ownerâs mark; that the message of the mark came from the\nwords\nin combination; and that the word Polo functioned adjectivally\nin the context of the applicantâs mark. Adjectival use may be\ndistinctive\nfrom the use of a word as a noun. The same considerations\napply too in the present case to exclude the reasonable possibility\nof\nconfusion or deception.\n[16]\tThe next consideration is the\nquestion of infringement of the Associationâs device marks that\ncontain the words Century City.\nI have already disposed of the marks\nregistered in class 41, leaving the registrations in classes 35, 36\nand 42. The Associationâs\nargument in this regard was fairly\nsimple: since the device mark contains the words Century City any use\nof the words Century City\nwould infringe because they are, orally,\nconfusingly similar.\n[17]\tThe answer is not that\nstraightforward. To determine the likelihood of confusion the matter\nmust be approached globally. Different\ntypes of trade marks are used\ndifferently, something recognized by the definition of âuseâ in\nthe Act\n(s 2(2)).\n1\nanc\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote1sym\">\n1\nA device is by definition a âvisual representation or illustration\ncapable of being reproduced upon a surfaceâ\n(s 2\nâdeviceâ). The\nvalue (and distinctiveness) of such a mark depends heavily (and\nsometimes exclusively) on its visual impact. \nIn this respect it is\nnot much different from marks that consist of a colour or\nornamentation or are containers. If these marks are\ncombined with\nwords or names their oral value may, depending on the circumstances,\ncome to the fore. The same applies if they can\nbe referred to\ndescriptively. It may therefore be that the aural and/or conceptual\ndominant component of such a mark neutralises\nthe visual differences\nderiving from its graphic particularities (\nCervecerÃ­a\nModelo, SA de CV v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market\n(Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM)\n2005\nWL 366940). Jeremy Phillips suggests in a footnote that it depends\nvery much on the nature of the goods or services (\nTrade\nMark Law â A Practical Anatomy\n(2003)\nOUP paras 10.29-10.33).\nThe\nappellantâs services are provided mainly through advertisements and\ninternet sites. There is no evidence of oral use of the\ndevice marks\nin relation to the services involved. The likelihood of confusion\nappears to me in the circumstances of the case to\nbe negligible and\ncan be discounted. It follows from this that I am of the view that\nthe Association has failed to establish infringement\nof the remaining\ndevice marks.\n[\n18]\tThe\nappellant, in defence, relied on\ns 34(2)(b)\nof the Act which in\nessence provides that a registered trade mark is not infringed by the\nuse by any person of any bona fide description\nor indication of the\ngeographical origin of his services.\n2\nThis defence represents the other side of the coin of the requirement\nthat the infringing use has to be trade mark use. A bona fide\ndescription or indication of the geographical origin of an alleged\ninfringerâs services amounts to non-trade mark use and whether\none\nconsiders it as part of the trade mark ownerâs cause of action or\nas a defence does not make much difference. Since I have\nalready\nfound that the appellantâs use of its trade or brand name and the\ndomain name amounted to trade mark use, this defence\nhas to fail.\nThe counter-application â\ngeographical origin\n[\n19]\tThe\nappellant launched a counter-application for the expungement of the\nAssociationâs registrations by relying on\ns 10(2)(b)\nof the Act. It\nprovides that a mark may not be registered and a registered trade\nmark is liable to be removed from the register if\nit consists\nexclusively of a sign or an indication which may serve, in trade, to\ndesignate the geographical origin of the services.\n3\nThe factual basis of the argument was that Century City has become a\ngeographical location that designates the geographical origin\nof\nservices.\n[\n20]\tIt\nis necessary to consider the history of this provision more closely\nsince both sides relied on judgments in support of their\nrespective\narguments concerning its interpretation on the supposition that our\nlaw and, for instance, English law on trade marks\nhave always been\nthe same, and that general propositions in older trade mark cases are\nstill applicable under the present legislative\nregime.\n[\n21]\tThe\nPatents, Designs and\nTrade Marks Act (1883\n) 46 & 47 Vict c 57 did\nnot deal with trade marks with a geographical connotation. It did,\nhowever, list the matters which trade\nmarks had to consist of or\ncontain. Trade mark registrations then were limited to names of\nindividuals or firms represented in âsome\nparticular and\ndistinctive mannerâ, a signature, a distinctive device and the\nlike, as well as a âfancy word or words not in\ncommon useâ\n(s\n64(1)(c)).\nThe 1888 amendment added âan invented word or wordsâ\nto the list and replaced âfancy word or words not in common useâ\nwith\nâa word or words having no reference to the character or\nquality of the goods, and not being a geographical name.â The\nreasons\nfor these provisions were said to be that the vocabulary of\nthe English language is common property which belongs to all and that\nno one should be permitted to prevent other members of the community\nfrom using âfor purposes of descriptionâ a word that has\nreference to character or quality of goods and, one assumes,\ngeographical names (\nIn\nre Eastman Photographic Materials Co Ltd v The Controller-General of\nPatents, Designs and Trade-marks\n1898\nAC 571\n(HL) per Lord Herschell). Fry LJ referred to the perpetual\nstruggle to enclose and appropriate as private property certain\nlittle\nstrips of the great open common of the English language (\nIn\nre Dunnâs Trade-marks\n(1889)\n41 ChD 439).\nIt is apparent from the use of the phrase âfor\npurposes of descriptionâ that the concept of trade mark use had not\nyet been understood\nfully.\n[\n22]\tThe\nTrade Marks Act of 1905 (5 Edw VII c 15) was not much different\nalthough in regard to geographical names it prohibited the\nregistration of any name if it was âaccording to its ordinary\nsignification a geographical nameâ (s 9(4)). This was introduced\nto\novercome the objection to the registration of geographical names that\nwere not generally known. Courts nevertheless struggled\nwith its\napplication (T A Blanco White and Robin Jacob\nKerlyâs\nLaw of Trade Marks and Trade Names\n11 ed (1983) p 83). The Act was amended to create a two-part\nregister. The law was then consolidated in the Trade Marks Act of\n1939\n(1 & 2 Geo VI c 22). In relation to a registration in Part A\nof the register (s 9(1)), which dealt with inherently distinctive\nmarks, this Act was identical to the 1905 Act but in relation to\nmarks that were capable of becoming distinctive, which were\nregisterable\nin Part B, a similar limitation did not exist.\n[23]\tSouth African\nlegislation did not in all respects follow suit. The Patents,\nDesigns, Trade Marks and Copyright Act 9 of 1916\npermitted the\nregistration of âa distinctive word or words not reasonably\nrequired for use in the tradeâ and âany other distinctive\nmarkâ\n(s 99). The Act accordingly did not prohibit the registration of\ngeographical names\nper\nse\nand consequently any such name, which was distinctive and not\nreasonably required for use in the trade, could have been registered.\nIn addition, s 126 provided that a trade mark registration could not\ninterfere with the bona fide use by a person of his own place\nof\nbusiness. This Act was replaced by the Trade Marks Act 62 of 1963,\nand although it was largely based on the 1939 British Act it\nretained\nthe provisions of s 99 the 1916 Act but limited them to Part A\nregistrations. In other words, words not reasonably required\nfor use\nin the trade were capable of registration; there was no specific\nreference to geographical names; and s 46 was in this regard\nin the\nsame terms as the mentioned s 126.\n[\n24]\tThe\n1963 Act was materially amended by Act 46 of 1971.  It provided that\nin order to be registrable in part A of the register,\na trade mark\nhad to contain or consist of a âdistinctiveâ mark (s 10(1)).\nâDistinctiveâ was defined in s 12 to mean\nâ\nadapted,\nin relation to the goods or services in respect of which a trade mark\nis registered or proposed to be registered, to distinguish\ngoods or\nservices with which the proprietor of the trade mark is or may be\nconnected in the course of trade from goods or services\nin the case\nof which no such connection subsistsâ¦\nâ\nIn order to be registrable in part B\nof the register, a trade mark had to be capable of becoming\ndistinctive through use (s 11).\n[\n25]\tIt\nfollows from this historical analysis that reliance on English or\nAustralian (which followed the formerâs lead) cases dealing\nwith\nthe validity of a trade mark consisting of a word which is according\nto its ordinary signification a geographical name are of\nlittle if\nany value in interpreting our statutes. In this regard I refer\nparticularly to judgments such as\nYorkshire\nCopper Works Ldâs Application\n1953 (70) RPC 1\n(CA),\nMid Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd & Ors\n[1998] FCA 1616\nand\nRe Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford t/a\nOxford University Press v The Registrar of Trade Marks\n[1990] FCA 175.\nAs I have stated before in the context of laudatory\nmarks,\nâ\nIntellectual\nproperty laws and principles are not locked in a time capsule or a\nstraitjacket and judicial expositions should be read\nin context.\nâ\n(\nFirst\nNational Bank of SA Ltd v Barclays Bank plc\n2003 (4) SA 337 (SCA); [2003] 2 All SA 1\n(SCA) para 10).\n[\n26]\tA\nmajor shift in the approach to trade marks followed the adoption of\nthe European Unionâs directive on trade marks during 1988.\nThe\nUnited Kingdom was obliged to bring its laws into conformity with the\ndirective and did so by the passing of the Trademarks Act\nof 1994. As\nwas pointed out in\nInter\nLotto\n(UK) Ltd v Camelot Group plc\n[2003] EWCA Civ 1132\n, the 1994 UK Act is a hybrid with two main\nEuropean sources: the Directive, aimed at harmonization of the\nnational trademarks laws,\nand the Regulation, introducing the new\nCommunity trademark. Our country decided to follow this lead and\npassed the 1993 Act, which\nwas based on the bill that led to the\nadoption of the UK Act in 1994. Our law is now in many respects the\nsame as that of the UK\nand of the European Community.\n[\n27]\tThe\neffect of the English development was described by Arden LJ in these\nterms in\nDavid\nWest t/a Fastenders v Fuller Smith & Turner plc\n[2003]\nEWCA Civ 48\nat para 69:\nâ\nTo\na much greater degree, this case illustrates the break with our\ndomestic past brought about by the 1994 Act. The words [Extra Strong]\nfor which the first two initials [E.S] stand are merely laudatory\nwords, the mark [E.S.B.] consists purely of initials and the words\n[Extra Strong/Special Bitters] connoted by the initials are mere\ndescriptors. This concatenation of features would have made it\ndifficult\nfor this mark to survive the present attack under our\npre-1994 Act domestic law. If King Canute had been a trademark agent,\nthe waters\nof Community law, which Lord Denning depicted as rushing\nup our native shores, would surely have overwhelmed him by now.\nAs\nthe respondent submits, one has to start by forgetting the\npreconceptions of pre-1994 Act trade mark law.\nâ\n[\n28]\tAgainst\nthis background I proceed to consider the meaning of s 10(2)(b) and\nmore particularly the question as to when a mark consists\nexclusively\nof a sign or an indication which may serve, in trade, to designate\nthe geographical origin of the services. Its wording\nwas derived from\nart 3 of the European Directive, which also provides that t\nrade\nmarks\n'which consist exclusively of signs or\nindications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind,\nquality, quantity, intended purpose,\nvalue, geographical origin, or\nthe time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service,\nor other characteristics of the\ngoods' may not be registered or if\nregistered are liable to be declared invalid.\nIt\nshould be noted that this provision does not deal with what are\ncalled geographical indications such as Champagne which connotes\na\nsparkling wine with a particular geographical origin. These are\ncovered by s 42 under the heading âcertification trade marksâ.\n[\n29]\nSection\n10(2)(b) prohibits the registration of geographical names as trade\nmarks âsolely where they designate specified geographical\nlocations\nwhich are already famous, or are known for the category of goods or\nservices concerned, and which are therefore associated\nwith those\ngoods in the mind of the relevant class of personsâ. It also\nprohibits registration of geographical names that are likely\nto be\nused by undertakings. They ought to remain available as indications\nof the geographical origin of the category of relevant\ngoods or\nservices (\nPeek\n& Cloppenburg KG's Application\n[2006] ETMR 33\npara 34).\n[\n30]\tSection\n10(2)(b) must be read in context. It also deals on the same basis\nwith marks that may designate the kind, quality, quantity,\nintended\npurpose, value, or other characteristics of the goods or services. It\nis not concerned with distinctiveness or its loss.\nThat is dealt with\nin s 10(2)(a),\n4\nwhich in turn is the counterpart of s 9\n5\nto which it refers. The prohibition is not directed at protecting\ntrade mark use only but goes wider: it is sufficient if the name\nmay\nâdesignateâ the geographical origin of the goods or services.\n[31]\tIt\nhas been said that the provision serves a public interest permitting\nall to use such descriptive signs freely by preventing\nthem from\nbeing reserved to one undertaking alone because they have been\nregistered as trade marks (\nPeek\n& Cloppenburg\npara\n32)\n.\nIn addition\nâ\nit\nis in the public interest that they [the geographical names] remain\navailable, not least because they may be an indication of the\nquality\nand other characteristics of the categories of goods concerned, and\nmay also, in various ways, influence consumer tastes\nby, for\ninstance, associating the goods with a place that may give rise to a\nfavourable response.\nâ\n(\nWindsurfing\nChiemsee Produktions- und Vertriebs GmbH v Boots- und SegelzubehÃ¶r\nWalter Huber and Franz Attenberger\n[1999] ETMR 585\npara 26.)\n[32]\tCounsel debated the meaning of\nâexclusivelyâ\nin the context of the provision but there can be little doubt that it\nmeans that the prohibition is directed at\na mark that consists of a\ngeographical name without more. A device that includes a geographical\nname would not be hit nor would a\nname mark consisting of a\ngeographical name with something more be covered. I shall revert to\nthis issue. (Compare the reasoning\nin\nCambridge\nPlan AG v Moore\n1987 (4) SA 821 (D) 844D-H.) What this means is\nthat Gordonâs London Gin would be a permissible trade mark\nbut not\nâLondonâ in respect of gin.\n[\n33]\tThis\nleads to another aspect and that concerns the nature of the goods or\nservices. London has at least since the 18th Century\nhad an\nassociation with gin. But Bloemfontein does not have one and there\nappears to be no reason why the name Bloemfontein\nper\nse\ncannot be used as a trade mark for gin in the same way as Windhoek, a\nwell-known trade mark and the capital of Namibia, is used as\na trade\nmark for beer. The explanation is to be found in\nBellagio\nLLCâs Application\n[2006]\nETMR\n79.\nThe applicant sought to register the trade mark âBellagioâ in\nfour different classes namely class 25 for clothing; class 35 for\nretail services; class 41 for entertainment services; and class 42\nfor hotels and the like. The application was granted in respect\nof\nthe first two classes but refused in relation to the last two. The\nreasons, in summary, were these: Bellagio is a village on Lake\nComo\nin Northern Italy; it is a noted lakeside resort; the travelling\npublic would associate the name of the village with entertainment\nand\nhotels; and therefore the mark could not be registered in connection\nwith these services. However, the public would not necessarily\nassociate the village with clothing or retail services and in\nconnection with those services the prohibition did not apply.\n[\n34]\tIn\nPeek &\nCloppenburg\nthe applicant\nsought to register the name Cloppenburg in respect of retail\nservices. Cloppenburg is a small town in Germany and the\napplication\nfor registration was refused in the first instance on the ground that\nthe applicantâs services would have been supplied\nfrom that town,\nand to that end users would have perceived the town name as an\nindication of geographical origin. The court upheld\nthe appeal,\nholding that a sign's descriptiveness cannot be assessed other than\nby reference to the goods or services concerned,\non the one hand, and\nby reference to the understanding which the relevant persons have of\nit, on the other (para 38). It said:\nâ\nIn\nmaking that assessment the [trade mark] Office is bound to establish\nthat the geographical name is known to the relevant class\nof persons\nas the designation of a place. What is more, the name in question\nmust suggest a current association, in the mind of the\nrelevant class\nof persons, with the category of goods or services in question, or\nelse it must be reasonable to assume that such\na name may, in the\nview of those persons, designate the geographical origin of that\ncategory of goods or services.\nâ\nThe Century City marks\n[35]\tWith this in mind it is now\nnecessary to consider the facts that are relevant to the appellantâs\ncontention that âCentury\nCityâ\nconsists\nexclusively of a sign or an indication which may serve, in trade, to\ndesignate the geographical origin of the services covered\nby the\nAssociationâs registrations. The device marks can immediately be\ndiscounted from consideration on this aspect because, as\nsaid, they\ndo not consist âexclusivelyâ of what the appellant contends is a\ngeographical location, namely Century City. However,\nthe name marks\nhave to be considered in due course.\n[\n36]\tThe\nmain contention of the appellant was that although when the trade\nmark applications were made the name Century City had no\ngeographical\nsignificance â and that the trade marks were accordingly properly\nregistered â the name at the date of the counter-application\nhad\nbecome a place name and was therefore liable to be removed from the\nregister under s 10(2)(b).\n[\n37]\tI\nhave at the outset referred to Century City as a huge commercial and\nresidential âdevelopmentâ falling within the municipality\nof the\nCity of Cape Town and, more particularly, the suburb Montague\nGardens. I have also mentioned that it was always the intention\nthat\nCentury City would be one development, independently functioning and\noperating, providing a cross pollination of services and\nindustries\nto the owners and tenants within Century City. It would be, it was\nsaid in the founding affidavit, a city within a city,\npresenting a\nhigh value investment opportunity to the owners of property within\nthe development providing commercial, business, retail,\nresidential\nand leisure opportunities.\n[\n38]\tTo\ngive some indication of the extent of the development, promotional\nmaterial pre-dating 2008 indicates that Canal Walk, when\nopened in\n2000, was the largest shopping centre in Africa with 125 000 sq m\nretail and 9 600 sq m office space; and that in Century\nCity more\nthan 156 000 sq m office space had been sold, that more than 2 000\nhomes had been completed, and that by 2010 more than\n60 000 persons\nwould be working and living in Century City. It is unnecessary to\nprovide any further detail save to say that Century\nCity has become\nan important landmark.\n[39]\tAs stated earlier, t\nhe\nAssociation is a non-profit home ownersâ association. Its main\nactivity is to promote, advance and protect the communal interests\nof\nall the owners, lessees, occupiers and visitors to Century City, and\nto manage the common property. All owners and all new owners\nare\nobliged to become members of the association. It collects levies from\nits members and performs functions similar to those of\na body\ncorporate of a sectional title development. Its services are, in the\nmain, to supply access control, security, traffic and\nparking\ncontrol, provision of public transport within the development,\napproval of special events staged within Century City, development\ncontrol through the setting of design requirements and approval\nmechanisms, and landscaping. Finally, it is said that the Association\ncontrols the use of the trade marks by other entities. Many of these\nfunctions are entrusted to contractors.\n[\n40]\tThe\nAssociation itself describes Century City â maybe hyperbolically â\nas a city or a city within a city, and as a commercial\nhub,\ncomplementary to Cape Townâs central business district, and as a\nplace. There is a post office under the name Century City\nand public\nroad signs direct the public to Century City. The public, no doubt,\nrefers to it as a place or location. The businesses\nthat conduct\ntheir business there describe it as such. A person who intends to\ndine at Steers or Spur or whatever restaurant at Century\nCity will\ndescribe the restaurant with reference to its location; and the\nrestaurateur would do the same. Further examples abound\nin the\npapers. Most telling is Century City Service Station â a petrol\nstation.\n[\n41]\tThe\nAssociation had two arguments which were supposed to dispose of the\neffect of these facts. The first, which was more a statement\nthan an\nargument, was that s 10(2)(b) applies to historical place names only.\nNo reason was proffered why such a limitation should\nbe read into the\nprovision and I cannot conceive of any, especially where s 10\npresupposed that the prohibition under s 10(2)(b)\nmay kick in after\nthe date of registration of the trade mark. The second was that,\nsince Century City was both a place name and the\nname of a\ndevelopment, the provision could not be applicable. Davis J accepted\nthis argument and held that because the meaning of\nCentury City\nflowed directly from the development of a piece of land located in\nMontague Gardens it was inextricably linked to the\nparticular\ndevelopment; that the trade mark right emerged from the nature of the\ndevelopment rather than from âa dictionary meaningâ\nor a\ngeographical location; and since the name did not have an\nâexclusively geographical meaningâ it was not hit by the\nprovision.\n[42]\tI find it\ndifficult to accept these propositions.\nThe\ndifference between a geographical location and a development is more\napparent than real. In the present context the term refers\nto âan\narea of land with new buildings on itâ (\nConcise\nOxford English Dictionary\n10\ned 2002 sv âdevelopmentâ). More particularly, Century City is a\ngeographical area, fenced and gated and secured, like many\na township\nin this country, with a multitude of individual owners. It differs\nfrom a suburb or village in that roads and the like\ndo not belong to\na local authority but to an ownersâ association and that the\nAssociation provides some, but not all, of the services\nthat local\nauthorities usually supply. Whether it is a suburb in the dictionary\nsense of the word matters not.\n[\n43]\tEdinburgh,\nfor example, is inextricably linked to its burgh and was nothing but\npart of the development around the castle. The\nfact that the town\nâemergedâ from the castle does not mean that Edinburgh is not a\nplace. Most cities and towns in this country\nare inextricably linked\nand to have emerged from farm property, a mine or river but that does\nnot mean that they are not geographical\nlocations.\n[\n44]\tAs\nto the final point, the section does not require that the place name\nshould have an âexclusively geographical meaningâ.\nSome\ngeographical names are, for instance, also surnames â as was the\ncase in\nPeek &\nCloppenburg\nâ but that\ndoes not exclude the operation of the prohibition. As I have sought\nto explain earlier, the word âexclusivelyâ in\ns 10(2)(b) ensures\nthat a geographical name, which is part of a âcomplexâ trade mark\ndoes not fall within its purview (\nNordmilch\neG v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and\nDesigns) (OHIM)\n[2004] ETMR\n70\nparas 45 and 55) and not that the name may not have any other\nsignificance.\n[\n45]\tHaving\nconcluded that Century City has become the name of a geographical\nlocation the next matter to determine is whether it is\na sign or an\nindication which may serve, in trade, to designate the geographical\norigin of the services covered by the registrations.\nThere is nothing\nin the evidence to suggest that in relation to some of the services\ncovered by the class 35 registration, for instance\nbusiness\nservices relating to township and residential development and\nmanagement services, it may serve this purpose. On the other\nend of\nthe spectrum the evidence clearly establishes that the public\nperceives it and businesses regard it as a place where entertainment\nis offered by way at least of cinemas and a theme park. This means\nthat the class 41 registration\nmay\nserve, in trade, to designate the geographical origin of the services\nlisted.\n[\n46]\tConsidering\nthat there are probably hundreds of commercial enterprises that offer\nthe services mentioned on the class 42 registration\nlike\nretail\nmerchandising services and providing of food and drink, Century City\nmay serve,\nin trade, to designate the geographical origin of these services. As\nto class 36, it includes also services that are hit\nby s 10(2)(b),\nmore particularly, estate agencies, real estate management, and\nletting of real estate. There are many property owners\nin Century\nCity who wish or may in future wish to market their properties or\nhave them managed and may wish to engage estate agents\nfor this\npurpose. They might wish to use Century City as the name of the\nlocation with which they have a business connection in the\nsense that\nthat is where the origin of their services is located. The same would\napply to âmanagement servicesâ in class 35.\nIn fact, the\nAssociation alleged that\nâthrough\nits licensees and permitted users it has an extensive reputation in\nthe Century City trade marks in the field of residential\nand business\ndevelopments, selling and letting of real estate, and the provision\nof related servicesâ, which indicates that the\nname is required to\nindicate the geographical origin of these services.\nBlameworthy conduct\n[\n47]\tI\ntherefore conclude that the name marks in classes 35, 36, 41 and 42\nwere hit by the prohibition in s 10(2)(b). But that is not\nthe end of\nthe matter. The Association relied on the principle derived from\nGE\nTrade Mark\n[1973]\nRPC 297\n(HL);\nGeneral\nElectric Co v The General Electric Co Ltd\n[1972]\n2 All ER 507\n(HL)\nas\nadopted by this court in\nLuster\nProducts Inc v Magic Style Sales CC\n[1996] ZASCA 146\n;\n1997 (3) SA 13\n(A);\n[1997] 1 All SA 327\n(A)\n,\nnamely that a trade mark can lose its distinctiveness only through\nthe âblameworthyâ conduct of the trade mark owner. Since\nthis\ncourt declined to define âblameworthyâ in Luster (at 26B-E) it is\nnecessary to revert to\nGE\nas a point of departure.\nGE\nwas\ndecided under the 1938 UK Act and\nLuster\nwas decided under the comparable provision in our 1963 Act. The main\nissue to decide was whether a trade mark that was distinctive\nat the\ntime of its registration could be removed from the register because\nof a subsequent loss of distinctiveness. This depended\non an\ninterpretation of the 1938 Act, more particularly the meaning of the\nphrase â\nany entry\nwrongly remaining on the registerâ,\nand the House of Lords held in the affirmative.\n6\nThe same problem does not arise under s 10 of our current Act â the\nwording is clear. The subsidiary question was: when would a\ncourt\nexercise its discretion against the trade mark owner? The House in\neffect held on an interpretation of the Act that if a trade\nmark\nbecame confusing the trade mark owner would become disentitled to the\nprotection of the law if there had been blameworthy conduct\non its\npart.\n7\nThe minority in the High Court of Australia adopted this reasoning in\nNew South Wales Dairy\nCorporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd\n1991 RPC 144\n,\nand this court quoted one of the minority judgments with approval. It\nis not without interest to note that\nHi-Bred\nCorn Company v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd\n[1978] 2 NZLR 50\n(CA) at 52 did not adopt the reasoning in\nGE\nin relation to its comparable identical provision.\n[\n48]\tThe\n1994 UK Act differs in this regard materially from its predecessor\nand from our 1993 Act. There is also no counterpart of\ns 16(1) of our\n1963 Act. Section 3(1)(c) of the UK Act prohibits the registration of\ntrade marks in the same terms as our s 10(2)(b)\nbut in contrast it\ndoes not deal simultaneously with marks already on the register. They\nare dealt with in s 46(1)(d) which provides\nthat the registration of\na trade mark may be revoked if âin consequence of the use made by\nthe proprietor or with his consentâ\nit is liable to mislead the\npublic âparticularly as to the nature, quality or geographical\noriginâ of the goods or services.\nThis appears to mean that\nâblameworthinessâ of the trade mark owner in the sense described\nhas become a statutory requirement\nin the UK.\nGE\naccordingly no longer represents law under this Act (D Kitchen et al\nKerlyâs\nLaw of Trade Marks and Trade Names\n14 ed (2005) para 10-119). Jeremy Phillips (op cit) does not even\nrefer to the\nGE\ncase\nin this context and neither work refers to the Australian judgment.\n[49]\tNothing in our\nstatute is to the same effect as s 46(1)(d), and there is nothing\npermitting a court to rewrite s 10(2)(b) to\nstate that a mark that\nconsists exclusively of a sign or an indication which may,\nas\na result of the blameworthy [or deliberate] conduct of the trade mark\nowner\n,\nserve, in trade, to designate the geographical origin of the\nservicesâ becomes subject to revocation. But that does not mean\nthat\na party can rely on the infringement, especially its own, to\nestablish that a trade mark has lost its efficacy under this\nprovision.\nWrongful acts by third parties cannot in general destroy\nrights. This truism also applies to trade mark rights. In was in that\ncontext\nthat\nLuster\nadopted the\nGE\ntest. And in\nSouth\nAfrican Football Association v Stanton Woodrush (Pty) Ltd t/a Stan\nSmidt & Sons\n2003 (3)\nSA 313\n(SCA);\n[2003] 1 All SA 274\n(SCA) para 16 the âruleâ was\napplied to dispose of an argument that subsequent trade mark\napplications could destroy an existing\nmark or reputation.\n[50]\tOn the facts of this case it\ncannot be doubted that the Association was responsible for the fact\nthat Century City became a geographical\nlocation and place name. It\nwas the necessary consequence of the nature of the development. It\nfollows that the four registrations\nstand to be revoked. I have\nconsidered the possibility to excise some of the services instead of\nrevoking the registrations but on\nthe information before us it is\nonly possible in relation to class 35 by deleting the words\nâmanagement servicesâ. Whether the\nAssociation may be able to\napply to have the name registered in some of the classes if the\nrelevant services are more appropriately\ndefined does not have to be\ndecided.\nThe undesirability of the CC name\nof the appellant\n[51]\tThe\nClose Corporations Act\nprovides\nthat any\ninterested person may within a period of two years after the\nregistration of a founding statement apply to Court for an\norder\ndirecting the corporation to change its name on the ground of\nundesirability or that such name is calculated to cause damage\nto the\napplicant, and the court may on such application make such order as\nit deems fit\n(s 20).\nThe Association sought and obtained relief under\nthis provision.\n[52]\tThe basis of its case was that\nthe appellantâs name contained its registered trade marks and that\nconsequently its name was\nundesirable. The court below accepted the\nsubmission and held that since the Association had by virtue of its\nregistration a vested\nright in the name Century City the presence of\nthat name in the appellantâs name was undesirable. In view of my\nearlier finding\nthat the Association did not have such a right, the\nbasis of the Associationâs case floundered.\n[53]\tIn any event, the names of the\ntwo corporations describe their differences: the one is a property\nownersâ association and the\nother is an apartment property services\nclose corporation. The only similarity is that both are linked to\nCentury City. That in itself\nis insufficient to justify a conclusion\nthat the business of the one is connected with the business of the\nother. I therefore conclude\nthat the court below erred in granting\nthis relief.\nPassing-off\n[54]\tThe Associationâs case based on\npassing-off fails on the same basis. The thrust of the Associationâs\ncomplaint related to\nthe appellantâs descriptive use of Century\nCity, namely identifying the location of the properties in which it\ndealt by reference\nto Century City. The court below accepted this\nsubmission on the basis of its finding that Century City is not a\ngeographical location\nbut a valid trade mark â findings that I have\nrejected earlier. The objections that apply to the appropriation of a\ngeographical\nlocation as a trade mark apply here too. It is difficult\nto conceive of a protectable reputation based purely on the name of a\ngeographical\nlocation that is inherently descriptive of the origin of\nthe particular service.\nCosts\n[55]\tLord Esher once said this about\npatent cases:\nâ\nIt\nseems to me that there is something catching in a patent case, which\nis that it makes everybody argue, and ask questions to an\ninterminable extentâa patent case with no more difficult question\nto try than any other case instead of lasting six hours is invariably\nmade to last at least six days, if not twelve.\nWell,\nthen, the moment there is a patent case one can see it before the\ncase is opened, or called in the list. How can we see it?\nWe can see\nit by a pile of books as high as this [holding up the papers]\ninvariably . . . Now, what is the result of all this? Why,\nthat a man\nhad better have his patent infringed, or have anything happen to him\nin this world, short of losing all his family by\ninfluenza, than have\na dispute about a patent. His patent is swallowed up, and he is\nruined. Whose fault is it? It is really not\nthe fault of the law; it\nis the fault of the mode of conducting the law in a patent case.â\n(\nUngar\nv Sugg\n[1892]\nRPC 113\nat 116â1.)\n[56]\tMore than a century later trade\nmark cases have also been infected by the virus.  Schutz JA once\nbegan a judgment with these\nwords:\nâ\nA\nrecord of 720 pages and heads of argument totalling 57 pages have\nbeen placed before us in order to allow us to decide whether the\nwrapping of its coconut biscuits used by one manufacturer passes\nitself off as the wrapping of another manufacturer of similar\nbiscuits.â\n(\nBlue\nLion Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd v National Brands Ltd\n[2001] 4 All SA 235\n(SCA) para 1.) Not to be outshone the parties in\nthis case presented us with a record of 1557 pages. Trade mark cases\nhave developed into paper wars\nin the apparent belief that the weight of the papers of the\nrespective parties determines the merits\nor that the threat of cost\norders would force the one or other party to capitulate. This case is\nyet another example of this unacceptable\npractice. Courts of first\ninstance should act firmly and disallow costs, especially between\nattorney and client. The Association\nbegan the war of attrition by\nattaching volumes of irrelevant paper. The appellant complained but\nresponded in kind. On appeal the\nAssociation, ironically, felt\naggrieved that the appellant did not omit the unnecessary papers\noriginally filed by it.\n[57]\tI was sorely tempted to make a\nspecial costs order but since both parties are equally guilty, as\nwell as in not reducing the\nrecord on appeal, I have decided against\nit. Practitioners apparently also believe that the more they burden\nthis court with paper\nthe better for them. Perhaps they hope that the\ncourt will locate a winning fact that they have missed. Practitioners\nare paid to\ndetermine what their case is about and to make a value\njudgment about what is required and what not; and not only to\nphotocopy documents.\nThis should serve as a final warning, also for\ncounsel who tell us to read unnecessary paper.\nOrder\n[58]\tIn the result the following order\nis made:\nThe appeal is upheld with costs.\nThe\n\torder of the court below is substituted with the following order:\nThe\n\t\tapplication is dismissed with costs.\nIn\n\t\trespect of the counter-application the following order is made:\nThe following trade mark\n\t\t\tregistrations are revoked: 1997/14283 in class 41;

    "facts": "Century City is a large mixed‑use development on the outskirts of Cape Town, administered by the non‑profit Century City Property Owners’ Association, which holds a number of trade‑mark registrations containing the name “Century City” in classes 35, 36, 41 and 42. The appellant, Century City Apartments Property Services CC, used the name “Century City Apartments” as its brand, corporate name and internet domain (centurycityapartments.co.za) to market accommodation‑booking services. The Association claimed that this use infringed its name and device marks, that the appellant’s corporate name was undesirable under the Close Corporations Act, and that there was passing‑off. The appellant also filed a counter‑application seeking expungement of the Association’s marks under s 10(2)(b) on the basis that “Century City” had become a geographical indication.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the appellant’s use of “Century City Apartments” infringes the Association’s trade‑mark registrations under s 34(1)(a) and s 34(1)(b). 2. Whether the appellant’s corporate name is undesirable under s 20 of the Close Corporations Act. 3. Whether the Association has a valid passing‑off claim. 4. Whether the marks consist exclusively of a geographical indication and therefore must be revoked under s 10(2)(b). 5. Whether any “blameworthy” conduct by the Association affects the revocation analysis.",
    "principles": "The court applied the principles of trade‑mark infringement: an identical mark or a confusingly similar mark used as a badge of origin may infringe (s 34(1)(a)); the need to assess similarity globally, considering visual, aural and conceptual aspects. A defence exists for bona‑fide description of geographical origin (s 34(2)(b)). Section 10(2)(b) bars registration (and allows revocation) of marks consisting exclusively of a sign indicating geographical origin; the word “exclusively” excludes mixed marks. Revocation may be ordered where the mark has become a geographical name and the proprietor’s conduct contributed to that status (the “blameworthy” test from GE and Luster). Passing‑off requires a reputation and likelihood of confusion. The Close Corporations Act s 20 allows a court to order a name change if the name is undesirable or likely to cause damage.",
    "application": "The court found that “Century City Apartments” is confusingly similar to the registered name mark “Century City” for the services covered by classes 42, 36 and 35, and therefore infringes those name marks; the domain name likewise infringes. The corporate name, however, was held not to be confusingly similar to the mark and thus not undesirable. The Association’s device marks were not infringed because no oral or visual use of the device occurred. The defence under s 34(2)(b) failed because the appellant’s use was trade‑mark use, not a mere geographical description. On the counter‑application, the court concluded that “Century City” had become a recognized geographical location; consequently the name marks in classes 35‑42 fall within s 10(2)(b) and must be revoked, with the class‑35 mark merely amended to delete “management services.” The “blameworthy conduct” analysis confirmed that the Association’s role in creating the place name did not prevent revocation.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The original application for relief was dismissed with costs. The counter‑application resulted in revocation of trade‑mark registrations 1997/14283 (class 41), 1997/14281 (class 36) and 1997/14282 (class 42); registration 1997/14280 (class 35) was rectified by deleting the words “management services”. The Association was ordered to pay the costs."
