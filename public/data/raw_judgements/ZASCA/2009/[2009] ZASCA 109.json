During its 1999 year of\r\nassessment it sold\nthese shares at a loss. In its income tax return\r\nfor that tax year the appellant claimed a deduction equal to this\r\nloss but the\nrespondent disallowed the deduction on the ground that\r\nthe shareholding was of a capital nature and that the loss did not\r\nqualify\nfor deduction. An appeal by the appellant to the Tax Court\r\nwas dismissed but that court granted leave to the appellant to appeal\n\nto this court.\n[2]\tIn 1994 the appellant, then known as Anglovaal\r\nLimited and at the time controlled by two families, had a mining\r\ndivision and\nan industrial division. The mining division consisted of\r\nvarious subsidiary mining companies whereas the industrial division\r\nconsisted\nof a 60% shareholding in Anglovaal Industries Limited\r\n(âAVIâ), a company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange\r\n(âthe\nJSEâ), which in turn had a number of subsidiaries. One of\r\nAVIâs subsidiaries was NBL in which it had a 97,7% shareholding.\r\nNBL was the company in which all the fast moving consumer goods\r\nbusinesses such as Five Roses Tea, Bakers Biscuits and Beaumontâs\n\nBiscuits were housed. Apart from its mining and industrial interests\r\nthe appellant, since the formation of the group of companies\nin 1933,\r\nhad actively traded in shares, particularly in listed mining shares,\r\nwhich were not regarded as strategic long term assets\nwith the object\r\nof making money by speculative investment.\n[3]\tOn 21 April 1994, pursuant to a resolution by the\r\nappellant, NBL purchased a snack food business carried on by United\r\nTobacco\nCompany under the name âWillards Foodsâ. The appellant\r\nfunded the acquisition by acquiring a 15,6% shareholding in NBL for\r\nthe amount of R300m. It in turn acquired the funds by issuing N\r\nordinary shares to foreign investors.\n[4]\tIn early 1998 Morgan Stanley, an investment bank,\r\nadvised the appellant to separate the mining from the industrial\r\ncompanies.\nThe appellant implemented the proposal by changing its\r\nname to Anglovaal Mining Limited and transferring its shares in AVI\r\nto another\nholding company. At the same time the appellant decided to\r\nsell the NBL shares held by it to AVI. The sale took place in the\r\nappellantâs\n1999 tax year at a price of R141 021 605\r\nleaving the appellant as a purely mining investment company. The sale\r\nresulted\nin a loss of R159 702 919.\n[5]\tAs stated above the respondent disallowed the\r\ndeduction of the loss from the appellantâs income during its 1999\r\nyear of assessment.\nIn its objection to the disallowance the\r\nappellant stated that under normal circumstances the shares issued by\r\nNBL to fund the\nWillards acquisition would have been issued to the\r\nholding company of NBL, namely AVI, and that the shares would have\r\nbecome part\nof AVIâs long term portfolio. However, the appellantâs\r\nmerchant bankers advised that funds could be raised in the\r\ninternational\nmarket by way of a foreign equity placement of\r\nappellantâs shares. The appellant followed the advice and raised\r\nthe funds required\nto acquire the new equity in NBL. It stated that\r\nnormally it would not have had a direct holding in a food company but\r\nwould have\nhad its exposure to NBL via AVI. An exception was made in\r\nthis case because NBL was earmarked for a listing on the Stock\r\nExchange\nlater in the year and the shares would have been sold by the\r\nappellant within a few months. The intention of taking up the shares\n\ndirectly was with a speculative motive and should be distinguished\r\nfrom appellantâs long-term strategic investment in NBL which\nwas\r\nheld indirectly through AVI. Unfortunately, according to the\r\nappellant, NBLâs profit performance after the Willardâs\r\ntransaction\ndeteriorated sharply with the result that the proposed\r\nlisting did not materialize. For these reasons, the appellant\r\ncontended,\nthe loss was tax deductible.\n[6]\tThe respondent dismissed the objection whereupon the\r\nappellant appealed to the Tax Court on the ground that the loss\r\nincurred\non the disposal of the shares should be allowed as a\r\ndeduction from income in the determination of taxable income on the\r\nbasis\nthat the amount represented a revenue loss actually incurred in\r\nthe production of income as envisaged in section 11(a) read together\n\nwith section 23(g) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962.\n[7]\tAt the time concerned the relevant part of s 11(a)\r\nof Act 58 of 1962 read as follows:\nâ11\tFor the purpose of determining the taxable income derived by\r\nany person from carrying on any trade within the Republic, there\n\nshall be allowed as deductions from the income of such person so\r\nderived â\n(a)\texpenditure and losses actually incurred in the Republic in the\r\nproduction of the income, provided such expenditure and losses\nare\r\nnot of a capital nature; . . .â\nSection 23(g) provided:\nâ23\tNo deductions shall in any case be made in respect of the\r\nfollowing matters, namely-\n. . .\n(g)\tany moneys claimed as a deduction from income derived from trade,\r\nto the extent to which such moneys were not laid out or expended\nfor\r\nthe purposes of trade;\n. . .â\nâIncomeâ was defined in s 1 as meaning âthe amount\r\nremaining of the gross income of any person for any year or period\nof\r\nassessment after deducting therefrom any amounts exempt  from normal\r\ntax under Part I of Chapter IIâ.\nâGross incomeâ, in terms of s 1, âin relation to any year\r\nor period of assessment, means, in the case of any person,\nthe total\r\namount, in cash or otherwise, received by or accrued to or in favour\r\nof such person during such year or period of assessment\nfrom a source\r\nwithin or deemed to be within the Republic, excluding receipts or\r\naccruals of a capital nature . . .â\n[8]\tTo qualify for deduction the appellantâs loss had\r\nto be a loss other than a loss of a capital nature. The appellant\r\ncontended\nthat it was not of a capital nature whereas the respondent\r\nsubmitted that it was. If the shares were acquired as trading stock\r\nwith the intention of disposing of them at a profit the former is the\r\ncase. See\nElandsheuwel Farming (Edms) Bpk v\r\nSekretaris van Binnelandse Inkomste\n1\nwhere Corbett JA said:\nâWhere a taxpayer sells property, the question as to whether the\r\nprofits derived from the sale are taxable in his hands by reason\nof\r\nthe proceeds constituting gross income or are not subject to tax\r\nbecause the proceeds constitute receipts or accruals of a capital\n\nnature, turns on the further enquiry as to whether the sale amounted\r\nto the realisation of a capital asset or whether it was the\nsale of\r\nan asset in the course of carrying on a business or in pursuance of a\r\nprofit-making scheme. Where a single transaction\nis involved it is\r\nusually more appropriate to limit the enquiry to the simple\r\nalternatives of a capital realisation or a profit-making\nscheme. In\r\nits normal and most straightforward form, the latter connotes the\r\nacquisition of an asset for the purpose of reselling\nit at a profit.\r\nThis profit is then the result of the productive turnover of the\r\ncapital represented by the asset and consequently\nfalls into the\r\ncategory of income. The asset constitutes in effect the taxpayer's\r\nstock-in-trade or floating capital. In contrast\nto this the sale of\r\nan asset acquired with a view to holding it either in a\r\nnon-productive state or in order to derive income from\nthe productive\r\nuse thereof, and in fact so held, constitutes a realisation of fixed\r\ncapital and the proceeds an accrual of a capital\nnature. In the\r\ndetermination of the question into which of these two classes a\r\nparticular transaction falls, the intention of the\ntaxpayer, both at\r\nthe time of acquiring the asset and at the time of its sale, is of\r\ngreat, and sometimes decisive, importance.\nOther significant factors\r\ninclude,\ninter alia\n, the actual activities of the taxpayer in\r\nrelation to the asset in question, the manner of its realisation, the\r\ntaxpayer's other\nbusiness operations (if any) and, in the case of a\r\ncompany, its objects as laid down in its memorandum of  association.â\n[9]\tAt the hearing of the appeal in the Tax Court the\r\nappellant tendered the evidence of two witnesses, Peter Menell and\r\nDavid Barber.\nDavid Barber became the Group Financial Manager of the\r\nAnglo Vaal Group in 1994 and in 1996 he was appointed Group Financial\r\nDirector.\nHe oversaw the unbundling process in 1998 and left the\r\ngroup when it was completed. At the time of the hearing in the Tax\r\nCourt\nhe no longer had any financial interest in the group. According\r\nto him the appellant often invested in shares with the purpose of\n\nreselling them and at every executive committee (âexcoâ) meeting\r\nof the appellant there was a slot for reporting on the purchase\nand\r\nsale of shares. He was responsible for the buying and selling of\r\ninvestments and before he became a member of exco he attended\nthat\r\npart of the exco meetings relating to the buying and selling of\r\ninvestments.\n[10]\tIn respect of the Willards transaction Barber, in a\r\nwritten presentation, suggested to exco that R300m of the funds\r\nrequired\nby NBL be funded by the appellant purchasing shares in NBL.\r\nHe testified that the appellant did not normally invest in an\r\nindustrial\nsubsidiary. There had to be some justification to permit\r\nthis type of unusual activity. His justification to exco was first\r\nthat\nby acquiring the shares the appellant would increase the group\r\nholding in NBL from 59% to 65%. Second, the direct holding could\nbe\r\nsold at a profit to a potential foreign partner. It was thought,\r\nafter the first democratic elections, with foreign companies\nlooking\r\nat South Africa as a potential new market, that it would be better to\r\nhave foreign fast moving consumer goods and food\ncompanies as a\r\npartner than a competitor and so get access to their brands. Third,\r\nAVI was an acquisitive company and sometimes\nacquired companies in\r\nexchange for AVI shares thereby diluting the appellantâs\r\nshareholding in AVI. To counter such dilution\nthe appellant would be\r\nable to sell its NBL shares to AVI in exchange for AVI shares so as\r\nto maintain its 60% shareholding in\nAVI which it considered to be the\r\ndesired holding. Fourth, in the event of a stock exchange listing of\r\nNBL being sought, a certain\nnumber of shares would have to be sold to\r\nthe public and the NBL shares could be used for that purpose without\r\nreducing AVIâs\nstrategic investment. He also stated in his written\r\npresentation that the NBL shares would be held in a tax efficient\r\nvehicle to\nminimise tax liability in the event of onward sale.\r\nHowever, no way could be found to âshelter the tax liabilityâ so\r\nthe shares\nwere left in the appellant.\n[11]\tThe direct holding by the appellant of shares in\r\nNBL was according to Barber inconsistent with the group structure but\r\nwas\nundertaken for two reasons. First, it allowed the appellant to\r\ntake advantage of the offshore market. Second, it was felt that it\n\nwas not a long term holding and that the structure would be restored\r\nwithin a short period of time as the intention was to dispose\nof the\r\nholding for profit in one of the three ways referred to above. Asked\r\nwhether AVI shares as opposed to the appellantâs\nshares could have\r\nbeen placed with a foreign investor Barber said that AVI would not\r\nhave given foreign investors an exposure to\nmining and would probably\r\nnot have been that attractive.\n[12]\tMenell joined the appellant in 1992 as Manager,\r\nFinance and Administration, Mines. In September/October 1994 he was\r\nappointed\nas a director of the appellant. Exco, which met every\r\nThursday, was the âmain forumâ for debating business decisions.\r\nHe only\nbecame a regular participant in these discussions as a member\r\nof the committee after October 1994 and was therefore not a party\nto\r\nthe actual decision relating to the acquisition by NBL of Willards or\r\nthe acquisition of a 15,6% shareholding by the appellant\nin NBL. He\r\ndid however confirm Barberâs evidence that the acquisition by the\r\nappellant of the 15,6% shareholding in NBL was inconsistent\nwith the\r\nstructure of the group as AVI was created âto be the home for all\r\nthe industrial interestsâ. To hold some of the NBL\nshares in the\r\nappellant was according to him âa step backwards to a more complex\r\nstructureâ.\n[13]\tMenell and Barber were two of the senior members of\r\nthe executive of the appellant who embarked on a marketing trip to\r\nNorth\nAmerica and Europe to sell its shares in order to raise the\r\nR300m required for the acquisition of the NBL shares. The group of\r\nexecutives was led by the managing director of the appellant and he\r\nspoke at every meeting of foreign investors. Menell testified\nthat\r\nforeign investors were told how the proceeds of the shares were going\r\nto be used. It was explained to them that buying a direct\nstake in\r\nNBL was contrary to the appellantâs policy of âstreamliningâ\r\nits industrial holdings through AVI but that it was\nan efficient\r\nmechanism and created various options to make an extra profit from\r\nthe transaction. Three options were mentioned.\nOne was to promote a\r\nlisting of NBL and sell the shares once NBL had been listed. Another\r\none was to sell the shares to an incoming\nforeign investor. The third\r\none was, in the event of a rights issue by AVI, to take up the shares\r\nin AVI against delivery of the\nNBL shares to AVI in lieu of cash so\r\nas to maintain the appellantâs 60% shareholding in AVI.\n[14]\tBarber testified that he gave the financial\r\nperspective of the Anglo Vaal Group at the presentations to foreign\r\ninvestors.\nHe confirmed Menellâs evidence that the appellantâs\r\nintentions with the NBL shares were mentioned to the foreign\r\ninvestors\nand stated that if the appellant held on to the NBL shares\r\noutside the AVI structure it would have been subject to criticism and\n\nthat that situation could not have lasted on a long-term basis.\n[15]\tThe statement in the appellantâs objection to the\r\nrespondentâs 1999 assessment that NBL was earmarked for a listing\r\non\nthe stock exchange later in the 1994 year and that NBL shares\r\nwould have been sold within a few months was not borne out by the\n\nevidence. In the public announcement of the acquisition by NBL of the\r\nbusiness of Willards Food Division it was stated:\nâVarious financing alternatives are presently being evaluated and a\r\nfurther announcement will be published once these are finalised.\nThis\r\nis not expected to result in the listing of NBL in the immediate\r\nfuture.â\nAlthough it appears from the papers discovered, such as\r\na draft prospectus, that a listing of NBL shares was on the cards in\r\n1993,\nand although it is stated in the exco minute dated 10 February\r\n1994 that a listing is being reviewed on an ongoing basis, that\r\noption was not proceeded with. Menell testified that as from the end\r\nof 1994 signs of a decline in the fortunes of NBL became apparent\nand\r\nthat profits dropped dramatically as from 1995 as a result of which\r\nthe listing of the shares was not proceeded with. But under\n\ncross-examination he had to concede that during 1993, 1994 and 1995\r\nNBL was the star performer in the AVI group, that NBLâs profits\n\ndeclined after June 1995, and that the statement in the objection was\r\nnot correct. A listing was only one of the options.\n[16]\tAccording to Barber the Willardsâ transaction did\r\nnot meet the expectations. As a result it became difficult to achieve\r\nthe\nbenefits foreseen in the acquisition of the NBL shares. Foreign\r\npartners would have required undertakings and warranties relating\nto\r\nthe health of the company, AVI would not have paid an amount which\r\nwould have allowed the appellant to make a profit and for\na listing\r\nit would have been necessary to show that the Willards transaction\r\nwas successful.\n[17]\tIn 1998 Morgan Stanley advised that the Group was\r\ntoo diversified, that the worldwide trend was back to core business\r\nand that\nthe market disliked family controlled structures. As a\r\nresult it was decided to restructure the group into firstly two and\r\nultimately\nthree separate companies in which, respectively, the focus\r\nwas on mining, engineering and food activities. The intention was\r\nthat\nthe appellant should end up being a purely mining investment\r\ncompany. It would have been anomalous for a mining company to retain\n\nthe 15% shareholding in NBL. For that reason it was decided that, as\r\npart of the transaction, the NBL shares should be sold to\nAVI.\n[18]\tIn a document prepared in 1998, at the time of the\r\nunbundling, it was stated in respect of the acquisition of the\r\nappellantâs\nNBL shares by AVI â\nâThis splitting of the shareholding was deemed appropriate at the\r\ntime as the shares acquired by Anglovaal would be those utilised\nfor\r\nthe introduction of any outside minority in National Brands. (At that\r\ntime certain global operations were considering returning\nto South\r\nAfrica and investing in F.M.C.G.\n2\noperations in the country.)\nAny outside shareholding introduction did not occur and the proposed\r\nrestructuring of AVI gives rise to the opportunity to rationalise\nthe\r\nNational Brandsâ shareholding.â\n[19]\tThe Tax Court held that the essential issue was\r\nwhether the intention of the appellant in acquiring the NBL shares\r\nwas to hold\nthem as a capital investment in order to derive income\r\ntherefrom in the form of dividends. It stated that âthe appellantâs\r\n98% shareholding in NBL as at the beginning of 1994, was a strategic\r\nlong-term investment of a capital natureâ. The Barber memorandum,\n\nin which it was stated that the Willards acquisition would have a\r\nmajor long-term strategic benefit for NBLâs activities, according\n\nto the Tax Court âquite clearly explains the appellantâs capital\r\nintent regarding the purported acquisition of the 15,6% shareholding\n\nin NBLâ. The NBL shares acquired by the appellant never became\r\nstock in trade.\n[20]\tThe Tax Court found support for its finding that\r\nthe acquisition was of a capital nature in the offering circular in\r\nrespect\nof the international placement of N ordinary shares in the\r\nappellant, more particularly:\n(a)\tIn the passage in which it is said that the\r\ndirectors âconsider the acquisition of Willards to be an important\r\nstep in Anglovaalâs\nstrategy of developing its interests in the\r\nbranded fast-moving consumer goods marketâ.\n(b)\tIn the fact that there is no mention in the document\r\nâthat suggests that they were being invited to put up the\r\nR300million\n(for the Willards acquisition) as a short term\r\nspeculation on the JSE as Messrs Menell and Barber would like the\r\ncourt to believeâ.\nThe direct holding of NBL shares in the appellant was a\r\nby-product of the method of financing of the Willards acquisition and\r\nthe\nresulting structure was not created for any speculative reasons,\r\nthe Tax Court held.\n[21]\tThe appellant submitted that it did not acquire the\r\nNBL shares as a capital investment but acquired them as trading\r\nstock.\nIn terms of s 1 of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, as it\r\nread at the time, trading stock âincludes anything produced,\r\nmanufactured,\npurchased or in any other manner acquired by a taxpayer\r\nfor purposes of manufacture, sale or exchange by him or on his\r\nbehalf,\nor the proceeds from the disposal of which forms or will form\r\npart of his gross income . . ..â\n[22]\tThe appellant submitted that the NBL shares were\r\nâpurchased . . . for purposes of  . . . sale or exchangeâ and\r\nalso that\nâthe proceeds from the disposal of (the shares) forms\r\npart of its gross incomeâ ie that on either basis the shares\r\nqualified\nas trading stock as defined.\n[23]\tThe Tax Court erred in equating the intention with\r\nwhich NBL shares were held in the appellant with the intention with\r\nwhich\nNBL shares were held in AVI. This is apparent from the Tax\r\nCourtâs reference to âthe appellantâs 98% shareholding in NBL\r\nas at the beginning of 1994â whereas it was AVI that held 98% of\r\nthe NBL shares. The appellant had an indirect interest of\r\napproximately\n59% in NBL only through its 60% shareholding in AVI.\r\nConsequently, the fact that the directors of the appellant considered\r\nthe\nacquisition of Willards to be an important step in the\r\nappellantâs strategy of developing its interests in the branded\r\nfast-moving\nconsumer market and the fact that the Willards\r\nacquisition would have had a major long-term strategic benefit for\r\nNBLâs activities\nindicated that the group had a long-term strategic\r\ninterest in NBL but it did not necessarily indicate an intention on\r\nthe part\nof the appellant to have a direct shareholding in NBL on a\r\nlong-term basis. None of these facts excluded the possibility that\r\nthe\nappellant had no long term intention to hold on to the NBL\r\nshares. It clearly had a long-term strategic interest in NBL through\n\nAVI but that is not to say that it had a long-term interest in having\r\na direct shareholding in NBL. The object of the Willards\ntransaction\r\nwas to strengthen the position of NBL but that is not to say that the\r\nmethod used to finance the transaction was intended\nto have permanent\r\nconsequences in so far as the direct holding of shares in NBL was\r\nconcerned.\n[24]\tThe Tax Court also erred in holding that if the\r\nintention of the appellant was to dispose, in due course, of the NBL\r\nshares\nacquired by it at a profit and if foreign investors were told\r\nthat that was the intention it would mean that the foreign investors\n\nwere invited to put up R300m as a short term speculation on the JSE.\r\nIt is true that the R300m was required for the purchase of\nthe NBL\r\nshares but the foreigners were not invited to invest in NBL; they\r\nwere invited to invest in the appellant which had mining\ninterests\r\nand industrial interests of which NBL constituted only 2%. The\r\nforeigners who bought shares in the appellant therefore\ninvested in\r\nthe appellant. That was not a speculative investment whether or not\r\nit was the appellantâs intention to dispose of\nthe NBL shares at a\r\nprofit.\n[25]\tIn\nCommissioner, South\r\nAfrican Revenue Service v Smith\n2002 (6) SA\r\n621\n(SCA) at 629C-E this court approved of the following dictum by\r\nMiller J in ITC 1185,\n35 SATC 122\nat 123-124:\nâIt is often very difficult, however, to discover what [the\r\ntaxpayerâs] true intention was. It is necessary to bear in mind\nin\r\nthat regard that the\nipse dixit\nof the taxpayer as to his\r\nintent and purpose should not lightly be regarded as decisive. It is\r\nthe function of the court to determine\non an objective review of all\r\nthe relevant facts and circumstances what the motive, purpose and\r\nintention of the taxpayer were.\nNot the least important of the facts\r\nwill be the course of conduct of the taxpayer in relation to the\r\ntransactions in issue, the\nnature of his business or occupation and\r\nthe frequency or otherwise of his past involvement or participation\r\nin similar transactions.\nThe facts in regard to those matters will\r\nform an important part of the material from which the court will draw\r\nits own inferences\nagainst the background of the general human and\r\nbusiness probabilities. This is not to say that the court will give\r\nlittle or no\nweight to what the taxpayer says his intention was, as\r\nis sometimes contended in argument on behalf of the Secretary in\r\ncases of\nthis nature. The taxpayerâs evidence under oath and that\r\nof his witnesses must necessarily be given full consideration and the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses must be assessed as in any other case\r\nwhich comes before the court. But direct evidence of intent\nand\r\npurpose must be weighed and tested against the probabilities and the\r\ninferences normally to be drawn from the established facts.â\n[26]\nSilke on South African\r\nIncome Tax\n11\nth\nMemorial Edition vol 1 para 3.2 says:\nâThe taxpayerâs own evidence about his intention and his\r\ncredibility will be considered by a court but, because of\r\nsubjectivity,\nself-interest, the uncertainties of recollection and\r\nthe possibility of mere reconstruction, it will test that evidence\r\nagainst\nthe surrounding facts and circumstances in order to establish\r\nhis true intention.â\n[27]\tRelying on these passages the respondent submitted\r\nthat the evidence of Barber and Menell that the appellant intended to\r\ndispose\nof the NBL shares at a profit should not be believed. The\r\nrespondent referred to the fact that they were testifying many years\r\nafter the event and submitted that their evidence is contradicted by\r\nthe content of the appellantâs objection to the assessment\nand that\r\nof the offering circular.\n[28]\tIn the objection to the assessment it is said that\r\nthe NBL shares were earmarked for a listing on the JSE later in the\r\nyear\nand that the shares would have been sold by the appellant within\r\na few months. That statement does not accord with the evidence\nof\r\nMenell and Barber. According to them a listing of the shares was\r\nmerely one of the possibilities. It is however not contended\nthat any\r\none of them was responsible for the statement. Both of them testified\r\nthat they no longer had any financial interest in\nthe matter and that\r\nevidence of theirs was never challenged. It is nevertheless worrying\r\nthat the appellant based its objection\non a wrong statement of fact,\r\nbut as to how it came to be made was never explored. In the\r\ncircumstances the fact that the statement\nis wrong does in my view\r\nnot afford a basis for criticising the evidence of Menell and Barber.\n[29]\tIn the circular in terms of which the appellantâs\r\nN shares were offered to foreigners so as to raise R300m (âthe\r\noffering\ncircularâ) it was simply stated that the ânet proceeds\r\nof the Offer will be used to expand Anglovaalâs interests in the\r\nbranded\nfast-moving consumer goods sector through the acquisition of\r\nthe Willards savoury snacks businessâ. The respondent submitted\r\nthat the fact that the offering circular failed to mention that the\r\nproceeds of the foreign placement of shares was intended to\nbe\r\nutilised for the acquisition of the NBL shares in a speculative\r\nventure, justified the Tax Courtâs rejection of  Menellâs\nand\r\nBarberâs evidence as to such intention. However, the statement in\r\nthe circular was correct and the fact that it was the intention\nto\r\ndispose, in due course, of the appellantâs direct holding of 15.6%\r\nof the NBL shares is not inconsistent with that statement\nor any\r\nother statement in the offering circular. Furthermore, in the light\r\nof the appellantâs vast mining and industrial interests,\nits\r\nintention, in so far as the NBL shares held by it are concerned, did\r\nnot warrant a mention in the circular.\n[30]\t As stated above the appellant, before the\r\nacquisition of Willards, held all its industrial interests through\r\nAVI. In the offering\ncircular it is stated:\nâAnglovaalâs industrial interests are controlled through a 60 per\r\ncent holding in AVI, a company which is itself listed on\nThe\r\nJohannesburg Stock Exchange. AVIâs businesses are, in the main,\r\nmajor participants in the markets which they serve. AVIâs\nprincipal\r\nsubsidiaries are Consol, engaged in the manufacture and marketing of\r\npackaging and rubber; National Brands, a leading\nsupplier of branded\r\nfast-moving consumer goods; AVI Diversified Holdings, a holding\r\ncompany for engineering and textile interests;\nIrvin & Johnson,\r\nwhich procures, markets and distributes fish and frozen foods; and\r\nGrinaker, which is engaged in construction\nand construction materials\r\nand the manufacture of electronic equipment and acts as a provider of\r\na wide range of communication\nand information technology services.â\nContrary to this statement the circular included a\r\ndiagrammatical representation of the group structure which indicated\r\nthat the\nappellant, in addition to its 60% shareholding in AVI held\r\n15,6% of the shares in NBL.\n[31]\tThe acquisition of a direct shareholding in NBL was\r\nclearly contrary to the existing structure as was testified by Barber\r\nand\nMenell. It is furthermore beyond question, in the light of\r\nBarberâs memorandum, that he explained to exco that the best option\n\nwas nevertheless to finance the Willards transaction by way of an\r\nacquisition of NBL shares, that the immediate effect would be\nthat\r\nthe appellant increased its interest in NBL which it could in due\r\ncourse sell to AVI, to a foreign investor or to private\ninvestors as\r\na float if it were decided to list the NBL shares on the JSE.\n[32]\tIn the light of the aforegoing there is in my view\r\nno reason to doubt the evidence of Barber and Menell that foreign\r\ninvestors\nasked questions about the appellantâs direct holding of\r\n15,6% of the shares in NBL. One would have expected them to do so. In\n\nthe light of the incongruous nature of the structure and Barberâs\r\nmemorandum there is also no reason to doubt Barberâs and\nMenellâs\r\nevidence that such direct shareholding was but a temporary aberration\r\nand that that was explained to the foreign investors.\nIt is highly\r\nimprobable that having structured the industrial holdings the way it\r\ndid the appellant would have hung on to its direct\nshareholding in\r\nNBL.\n[33]\tThe Tax Court rejected the evidence that one of the\r\noptions open to the appellant was to sell the NBL shares to a foreign\r\ninvestor\non the basis, first, that it was not supported by any\r\nevidence, documentary or otherwise and, second, that it was never\r\nshown that\nâthere was any foreign investor âwaiting in the wingsâ\r\nso to speakâ. It may be that there was no foreign investor waiting\n\nin the wings but the evidence that a sale to a foreign investor was\r\none of the options is borne out by the Barber memorandum and\n\nsupported by the statement in the offering circular that it was âthe\r\nobjective of the Group to form partnerships with overseas\n\ncorporations to exploit business opportunities both in South Africa\r\nand elsewhereâ. At the time of the acquisition of the shares\nthe\r\nprobabilities were that in the event of a sale to a foreign investor\r\nor another third party not occurring, the appellant would\nin due\r\ncourse sell the NBL shares to AVI at market value which the appellant\r\nthought would be higher than the purchase price ie\nat a profit. In\r\nthe event, the shares where not sold until the unbundling of the\r\nappellant in 1998. Barber testified that the reason\nfor not having\r\nsold them before the time was that NBLâs performance was such that\r\nthe shares became worth less than R300m. Again\nthere is no reason not\r\nto accept this evidence.\n[34]\tProf Wainer, a chartered accountant, was the only\r\nwitness called by the respondent. He testified that it was unusual\r\nfor a\ncompany to hold shares in its subsidiary with a speculative\r\nintent. If it was indeed the intention of the appellant to sell the\n\nNBL shares at a profit he would have expected disclosure of that\r\nintention in the financial statements of the appellant. Absent\nsuch a\r\ndisclosure everything in the financial statements suggests that the\r\nholding was long-term. The respondent submitted that\nthis evidence\r\ncasts grave doubt on the reliability of Menellâs and Barberâs\r\nevidence as to the intention of the appellant.\nHowever, the direct\r\nholding of shares in NBL in itself was unusual and it cannot be said\r\nthat the financial statements suggest\nthat the holding was long-term,\r\nas it is not disputed that the appellant traded in shares and that\r\nsuch shares were dealt with\nin the appellantâs financial statements\r\nin the same way as the NBL shares.\n[35]\tIn the light of the evidence of Menell and Barber,\r\nthe documentary evidence and the probabilities I am of the view that\r\nthe\nTax Court erred in not finding that it had been proved on a\r\nbalance of probabilities that the NBL shares had been acquired by the\n\nappellant with the intention of disposing of them at a profit ie that\r\nthe shares constituted trading stock in the hands of the\nappellant.\n[36]\tThe Tax Court, held that even if the NBL shares\r\nwere âacquired and held as part of a scheme of profit-making and\r\nwere part\nof [the appellantâs] trading stock, the expense of the\r\npurchase of R300 million, incurred in 1994, cannot  nevertheless be\r\nclaimed\nas a deduction in the 1999 year of assessmentâ. Its reason\r\nfor so holding was that the appellant had not, so the Tax Court held,\n\nin the 1994 tax year and in the ensuing tax years taken the expense\r\ninto account, whether as opening stock, purchases or closing\nstock.\r\nReferring to ss 11(a) and 22 of the Act it held that it was of\r\nfundamental importance âthat the actual deduction in respect\nof the\r\ncost price (of the shares) must have been made and taken into account\r\nin the determination of taxable income in the year\nof their\r\nacquisition (in terms of section 11(a)), and in addition in each year\r\nthereafter until disposition there must be appropriate\nfigures for\r\nclosing and opening (in terms of section 22)â.\n[37]\tThe respondent submitted that this finding of the\r\nTax Court was correct as income tax is an annual tax, which entails\r\nthat\ndeductions are to be claimed in the year of assessment during\r\nwhich the expenditure is actually incurred. It referred in this\r\nregard\nto\nSub-Nigel Ltd v Commissioner for\r\nInland Revenue\n1948 (4) SA 580\n(A) and\nCaltex\r\nOil (SA) Ltd v Secretary for Inland Revenue\n1975 (1) SA 665\n(A). In the\nCaltex Oil\ncase Botha JA said at 674B-C:\nâIn determining the taxable income of a person carrying on any\r\ntrade in any year of assessment there is, in terms of sec.11 (a),\n\ndeductible from such personâs income the expenditure actually\r\nincurred by him in the production of the income during that year\nof\r\nassessment.â\nIn the\nSub-Nigel\ncase Centlivres JA said at 589:\nâFor the whole scheme of the Act  shows that, as the taxpayer is\r\nassessed for income tax for a period of one year, no expenditure\n\nincurred in a year previous to the particular tax year can be\r\ndeducted.â\n[38]\tAt the relevant time s 22 of the Act provided\r\nas follows:\nâ(1)\tThe amount which shall, in the determination of the taxable\r\nincome derived by any person during any year of assessment from\n\ncarrying on any trade (other than farming), be taken into account in\r\nrespect of the value of any trading stock held and not disposed\nof by\r\nhim at the end of such year of assessment, shall be â\n(a)\tin the case of trading stock other than trading stock\r\ncontemplated in paragraph (b), the cost price to such person of such\n\ntrading stock, less such amount as the Commissioner may think just\r\nand reasonable as representing the amount by which the value\nof such\r\ntrading stock, not being shares held by any company in any other\r\ncompany, has been diminished by reason of damage, deterioration,\n\nchange in fashion, decrease in the market value or for any other\r\nreason satisfactory to the Commissioner; and\n(b)\t. . .\n(1A)\t. . .\n(2)\tThe amounts which shall in the determination of the taxable\r\nincome derived by any person during any year of assessment from\n\ncarrying on any trade (other than farming), be taken into account in\r\nrespect of the value of any trading stock held and not disposed\nof by\r\nhim at the beginning of any year of assessment, shall â\n(a)\tif such trading stock formed part of the trading stock of such\r\nperson at the end of the immediately preceding year of assessment\nbe\r\nthe amount which was, in the determination of the taxable income of\r\nsuch person for such preceding year of assessment, taken\ninto account\r\nin respect of the value of such trading stock at the end of such\r\npreceding year of assessment; or\n(b)\t. . ..â\n[39]\tIt follows that in terms of the section, in the\r\ndetermination of taxable income, the amount to be taken into account\r\nin respect\nof the value of shares held and not disposed of at the end\r\nof a year of assessment should be the cost price of those shares.\r\nThat\nsame amount, ie the cost price of the shares, is the amount that\r\nshould be taken into account in respect of the value of the shares\n\nheld and not disposed of at the beginning of the immediately\r\nfollowing year of assessment. In effect the cost price of shares as\n\ntrading stock is in terms of the section to be carried forward as\r\nopening and closing stock until the shares are disposed of. The\n\nlegislature clearly intended that the value of opening stock should\r\nbe deducted and the value of closing stock should be added\nto the\r\ntaxpayerâs taxable income.\n3\n[40]\tThe financial statements of the appellant for the\r\n1994 year of assessment contain a schedule in which the appellantâs\r\nshareholdings\nat the beginning of the year, their book value, share\r\npurchases during the year, the cost price of the shares, sales of\r\nshares\nduring the year, the selling price, the appellantâs\r\nshareholdings at the end of the year and their book value are listed.\r\nThe\nschedule indicates that the NBL shares had been purchased during\r\nthat year for a purchase consideration of R300m, that the book\nvalue\r\nof those shares at the end of that year was R300m and that no profit\r\nor loss had been made in respect of the shares during\nthat year. The\r\nincome statement contains an item âprofit on sale of investmentsâ\r\nwhich reflects the profit on the realisation\nof investments as per a\r\nschedule of profit on the sale of âinvestments-taxableâ and\r\nprofit on sale of âinvestments-non-taxableâ.\n[41]\tThe financial statements of the appellant for the\r\n1995 year of assessment are similar. Insofar as the NBL shares are\r\nconcerned\ntheir value at the end of the 1994 year is taken as their\r\nvalue at the beginning of the year; 1 344 shares at a value of\r\nR724 524\nbeing a dividend in specie is added as being a purchase\r\nduring the year; no profit or loss is shown for the year; and the\r\nbook\nvalue at the end of the year is reflected as R300 724 524\r\nie the cost of acquiring the shares. The same accounting procedure\n\nwas followed in respect of the 1996 and 1997 years of assessment. In\r\nrespect of the 1998 year of assessment the NBL shares were\ndealt with\r\ndifferently because the shares were going to be sold and the price at\r\nwhich they were going to be sold had already been\ndetermined. It was\r\ntherefore considered to be imprudent to carry the shares in the\r\nappellantâs accounts at R300 724 524\nwhen it was apparent\r\nthat they were worth R159m less. Provision was consequently made for\r\na loss of R159 068 301 (the\namount was wrongly calculated\r\nand should have been R159 702 919) and the book value of\r\nthe shares as at the end of the\nyear was reflected as R141 021 605.\r\nHowever, that loss was added back in order to arrive at the profit on\r\ninvestments\nfor the year. The net result for purposes of calculating\r\nthe income tax payable was therefore the same as it would have been\r\nif\nthe book value of the shares at the end of the year had been taken\r\nas being the same as at the beginning of the year namely\r\nR300 724 524.\n[42]\tIn the financial statements for the 1999 tax year\r\nthe book value of the NBL shares at the beginning of the year is\r\nreflected\nas R141 021 605  and it is also indicated that\r\nthey were sold for that price. However, in the computation of normal\r\ntaxation\na loss of R159 702 919 is taken into account. The\r\nnet result for purposes of calculating the income tax payable was\r\ntherefore\nthe same as it would have been if the book value of the\r\nshares at the beginning of the year had been taken as the cost price\r\nof\nthe shares.\n[43]\tReferring to these financial statements Barber\r\ntestified that, during the 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 years of\r\nassessment no\naccount was taken of the appellantâs expenditure in\r\nrespect of the NBL shares in the computation of the appellantâs tax\r\nliability.\nCounsel for the respondent argued that as no account of\r\nsuch expenditure was claimed during these years there is âno basis\r\nupon\nwhich deduction pertaining to the cost price of [the shares] can\r\nsuddenly be claimed in the 1999 year of assessment, for expenditure\n\nalready incurred in the 1994 year of assessmentâ. In this regard he\r\nreferred to an editorial in The Taxpayer, October 1967 which\n\nconcluded:\nâWhile, therefore, the practice of including opening and closing\r\nstock in determining taxable income, is well established, its\nlegal\r\nfoundation remains most uncertain.â\nCounsel submitted that âalthough the legal basis for\r\nadding back closing stock and carrying forward opening stock as a\r\ndeduction\nis uncertain, one thing which is certain is that one\r\ncommences the process by claiming a deduction in the year of\r\nassessment when\nthe expenditure is actually incurredâ.\n[44]\tIn my view there is no merit in the submission.\r\nWhen Barber testified that no account was taken of the appellantâs\r\nexpenditure\nin respect of the 1994 to 1997 years of assessment in the\r\ncomputation of the appellantâs income tax liability he could have\r\nmeant\nonly that the expenditure had no effect on such computation as\r\nit was cancelled out by the book value of the shares at the end of\n\nthe particular year as required by s 22. For purposes of\r\ncomputing the appellantâs income tax liability it acted in\r\naccordance\nwith the provisions of s 22.\n[45]\tFor these reasons the Tax Court should have found\r\nthat the appellant discharged the onus of proving that it was\r\nentitled to\nthe deduction of the amount of R159 702 919,\r\nbeing the loss suffered on the disposal of the NBL shares, against\r\nits taxable\nincome in the 1999 year of assessment.\n[\n46]\tThe following order is made:\n1\tThe appeal is allowed with costs including the costs\r\nof two counsel.\n2\tThe order by the Tax Court is set aside and the matter\r\nis referred back to the respondent to revise the appellantâs\r\nassessment\nfor the 1999 year of assessment on the basis that the\r\nappellant is entitled to the deduction of the amount of R159 702 919\n\nfrom its taxable income.\n__________________\nP E STREICHER\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nA\nppearances\n:\nFor Appellant:\tP A Solomon SC\nJ M A Cane\nInstructed by\nDeneys Reitz Attorneys, Johannesburg\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nFor Respondent:\tH Z Slomowitz SC\nR Bhana SC\nInstructed by\nThe South African Revenue Service, Pretoria\nThe State Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\n1978 (1) SA 101\n(A) at 118A-D.\n2\nFast-moving consumer goods.\n3\nRC Williams\nIncome Tax in South Africa - Law and Practice\n1994 p 281 para 24.2.",

    "facts": "In June 1994 Anglovaal Mining Ltd (the appellant) acquired a 15.6% shareholding in National Brands Limited (NBL) for R300 million, funding the acquisition through a foreign equity placement. The shares were intended to be a short‑term, speculative investment that could be sold to a foreign partner, to AVI, or on a future JSE listing. By 1998 the group restructured, separating mining from industrial interests, and the NBL shares were sold to AVI in the appellant’s 1999 tax year for R141,021,605, producing a loss of R159,702,919. The Revenue Service disallowed a deduction for the loss, classifying the shares as a capital investment. The Tax Court upheld the disallowance; Anglovaal appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the NBL shares were acquired as trading stock (a revenue asset) or as a capital investment. 2. Whether the loss on disposal could be deducted under s 11(a) of the Income Tax Act, given the nature of the asset. 3. Whether the deduction could be claimed in the 1999 year of assessment despite the expenditure having been incurred in 1994.",
    "principles": "The court applied the distinction between capital and revenue expenses under s 11(a) and the requirement of s 22 to account for the cost price of trading stock in the year of acquisition and in subsequent years. It relied on the objective test of taxpayer intention (Elandsheuwel Farming v Sekretaris, Commissioner v Smith) and the principle that the court must infer intention from the totality of facts, including business structure, past trading behaviour, and documentary evidence. The case also reaffirmed that deductions are generally claimed in the year the expense is incurred unless the asset is classified as trading stock, in which case its cost is carried forward as opening stock under s 22.",
    "application": "The court examined the testimony of senior executives Barber and Menell, who explained that the direct NBL holding was a temporary aberration intended for resale, and that the group’s usual practice was to trade shares for profit. The court found the Tax Court had erred in equating the appellant’s strategic long‑term interest in NBL (through AVI) with the intention behind the direct shareholding, and concluded that the shares were acquired with a profit‑making motive, qualifying them as trading stock. Consequently, the loss was a revenue expense deductible under s 11(a). The court also held that the failure to claim the deduction in earlier years did not preclude its claim in 1999, as s 22 requires the cost price to be reflected as opening and closing stock.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed. The Tax Court’s order was set aside and the matter referred back to the Revenue Service to revise Anglovaal’s 1999 assessment to allow a deduction of R159,702,919. Costs, including those of two counsel, were awarded to the appellant."
