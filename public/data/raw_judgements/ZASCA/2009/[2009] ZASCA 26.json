She sued the appellant for damages in the\r\nPietermaritzburg High\nCourt alleging that her fall was attributable\r\nto the appellantâs negligence. The matter came before Van der\r\nReyden J who, pursuant\nto an agreement between the parties, ordered\r\nin terms of uniform rule 33(4), that the trial first focus on the\r\nissue of liability\nand that quantum be stayed. At the conclusion of\r\nthe trial the high court ruled in favour of the respondent. See\nLindsay v Checkers Supermarket\n2008 (4) SA 634\n(N). This appeal against the judgment and order of\r\nthe high court is before us with the leave of that court.\n[2]\tThe appellantâs supermarket floor covers an area\r\nof some 2971.72 square metres\n1\nconsisting of 22 aisles. The respondent had entered the appellantâs\r\nsupermarket just before 18h00 to make certain purchases.\nAfter she\r\nhad selected her purchases she walked towards a till point to pay,\r\nand as she made her way past a fruit gondola she slipped\non an oily\r\nsubstance on the floor, lost her balance and fell injuring herself.\r\nAfter her fall, the appellant was attended to by\nMrs Sharleen\r\nGobichand, who at the time was a back administrative manager at the\r\nsupermarket. Mrs Gobichandâs evidence was\nthat when she arrived at\r\nthe area where the respondent had fallen she noticed an oil patch\r\naround the respondent covering an area\nshe estimated to be between 45\r\nto 48 cm and that it was still spreading. Throughout the respondentâs\r\nordeal, including the time\nshe was assisted and taken away, no\r\ncleaner arrived at the scene. The fruit and vegetable section is a\r\nknown high risk area where\nspillages which caused the floor to be\r\nslippery, always occurred. It is common cause that the respondentâs\r\nfall was the third\nin approximately a year in that supermarket.\n[3]\tThe evidence adduced in the court below shows that\r\nthe appellant had awarded a cleaning contract to a company, Super\r\nCare Cleaning\n(Super Care). Super Care was responsible for cleaning\r\nthe entire supermarket before the store opened in the mornings. After\r\nthe\nsupermarket opened, from 9 am to 2 pm two Super Care cleaners\r\nmaintained the floors by sweeping, mopping and going up and down the\n\naisles checking for spillages. After 2 pm one cleaner was\r\nresponsible for minding the floor and aisles until the supermarket\n\nclosed. The appellantâs employees were instructed that when they\r\nsaw a spillage the area was to be delineated and a cleaner/s\n\nsummoned.\n[4]\tThe court below, after analyzing all the evidence\r\ncame to the conclusion that the system the appellant had in place on\r\nthe day\nof the incident was inadequate to deal timeously with\r\nhazardous spillages.\n[5]\tIn our law liability for negligence arises if it is\r\nforeseen that there is a reasonable possibility of conduct causing\r\nharm\nto an innocent third party, and where there is an omission or\r\nfailure to take reasonable steps to guard against such occurrence.\n2\nThe duty of a supermarket owner/keeper to persons entering its\r\nsupermarket at all times during trading hours is aptly espoused\nby\r\nStegmann J\n3\nas follows:\nâ\nThe duty on the keeper of a\r\nsupermarket to take reasonable steps is not so onerous as to require\r\nthat every spillage must be discovered\nand cleaned up as soon as it\r\noccurs. Nevertheless, it does require a system which will ensure that\r\nspillages are not allowed to\ncreate potential hazards for any\r\nmaterial lengths of time, and that they will be discovered, and the\r\nfloor made safe, with reasonable\npromptitude.â\n[6]\tThe issue is therefore whether, on the particular\r\nfacts of this matter, the appellant had in place a reasonably\r\nadequate and\nefficient system, in relation to discovering and\r\nremoving dangerous spillages on the supermarketâs floor, to\r\nsafeguard persons\nwho frequented the supermarket from harm. In other\r\nwords was harm to the respondent reasonably preventable.\n4\n[7]\tProperly considered the\nres\r\nipsa loquitur\ndoctrine is irrelevant in this\r\nmatter to the issue that called for determination. The high court,\r\nquite properly, posed the correct\nquestion after considering the\r\nevidence led: whether the appellant âhad a proper system in place\r\nto deal with promptitude with\nspillagesâ.\n5\nIt was thus unnecessary to engage in any discussion about the\nres\r\nipsa loquitur\ndoctrine.\n[8]\tThe court below reasoned amongst others that\r\nemphasis on the length of time the spillage remained undetected\r\nwithout consideration\nof the adequacy of the cleaning system was an\r\nartificial and unrealistic test.\n6\nThe court went further and\r\nreasoned that the adequacy of the system had to be considered against\r\nthe number of cleaning staff allocated\nto deal with spillages, the\r\nfloor area and number of shopping aisles. Moreover the court went on\r\nto state that since experience\nhad shown that spillages do occur, the\r\nsystem could only respond with promptitude if a cleaner was stationed\r\nat the potential hazardous\nzones. In this regard the high court\r\nstated that\nit was obviously impossible\r\nfor\none cleaner and six staff\r\nmembers otherwise engaged to deal timeously with hazardous spillages\r\nbetween 2 pm and 6 pm in a supermarket\nof that size.\nWe\r\nknow, in this regard, that the respondent slipped on a spillage in\r\nthe fruit and vegetable section, a known high risk spillage\narea, and\r\nthat there was no dedicated attention, in the appellantâs cleaning\r\nsystem, to that section. The conclusion of the high\ncourt, that the\r\nappellantâs system was woefully inadequate, is also borne out by\r\nthe fact that no cleaner showed up throughout\nthe respondentâs\r\nordeal, at the section where she fell.\n[9]\tThe high court was correct in concluding that the\r\nrespondentâs fall was due to the negligence of the appellant on the\r\nbasis\nthat it did not have an adequate cleaning system in place that\r\nwas geared to discovering and responding with reasonable promptitude\n\nto dangerous spillages whenever they occurred on the supermarket\r\nfloor. The findings of the high court are, in my view, beyond\n\nreproach.\n[10]\tThe following order is made:\nâ\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.â\n_________________\nD MLAMBO\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT:  \tS R Mullins SC; H A de Beer\nINSTRUCTED BY:              \tMooney Ford Attorneys;\r\nDurban\nCORRESPONDENT:                  \tLovius-Block;\r\nBloemfontein\nCOUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT:\tR Seegobin SC; M G Chetty\nINSTRUCTED BY:\t\tJennifer Anthoo & Associates;\r\nPietermaritzburg\nCORRESPONDENT:\tHoney Attorneys Inc; Bloemfontein\n1\nThis evidence was received by this court pursuant to the grant of\r\n\tthe appellantâs application, to have the evidence admitted\non\r\n\tappeal to correct evidence led in the court a quo that the floor\r\n\tarea was approximately 15.000 square metres.\n2\nKruger v Coetzee\n1966 (2) SA 428\n(A) at 430E-G.\n3\nProbst v Pick ân Pay Retailers (Pty) Ltd\n[1998] 2 All SA\r\n\t186\n(W) at 200F; See also\nBrauns v Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd\n2004 (6) SA 211\n(E) at 218B-D;\nGordon v Da Mata\n1969 (3) SA\r\n\t285\n(A) at 289H.\n4\nBrauns v Shoprite Checkers\n(supra) at 218D.\n5\nAt 637G-F.\n6\nIt is in any event abundantly clear that the spillage did not occur\r\n\tmoments before the incident in question.",

    "facts": "On 16 September 2005 the respondent, Esme Lindsay, slipped on an oily patch in the fruit and vegetable aisle of Checkers Supermarket in Pine Town, KwaZulu-Natal, and suffered injuries. The supermarket floor measures about 2,971.72 square metres and contains 22 aisles. The store had a cleaning contract with Super Care Cleaning, which performed a morning clean and then provided two cleaners from 9 am to 2 pm, after which only one cleaner remained on duty until closing. The respondent entered the store shortly before 6 pm, slipped on a spill that had been present for some time, and no cleaner arrived to attend the area. This was the third similar incident in approximately a year at the same supermarket.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was whether Checkers Supermarket had a reasonably adequate and efficient system in place to discover and promptly remove hazardous spillages, thereby safeguarding customers, or whether the slip was reasonably preventable and thus gave rise to negligence liability.",
    "principles": "South African negligence law requires a foreseeable risk of harm to a third party and a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent it. A supermarket keeper owes a duty of care to entrants to maintain the premises safely. The duty does not require instantaneous cleaning of every spill but does require a system that prevents hazards from persisting for a material length of time. The court noted that the res ipsa loquitur doctrine was irrelevant to this determination.",
    "application": "Applying the above principles, the Court examined the cleaning regime and found it insufficient for a store of the size and risk profile. With only one cleaner on duty after 2 pm, the system could not reasonably be expected to detect and address spillages in high‑risk zones such as the fruit aisle. The absence of any cleaner at the scene, despite the spill having been present for an extended period, demonstrated that the supermarket failed to meet the required standard of care.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Court upheld the High Court’s finding that Checkers Supermarket was negligent for not having an adequate cleaning system to deal with hazardous spillages."
