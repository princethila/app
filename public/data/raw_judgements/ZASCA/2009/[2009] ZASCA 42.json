The appeal is with the leave\nof the\r\ncourt below.\n[2]\tThe\r\nappellant is a schoolteacher. During 1985 he taught at a school in\r\nVanderbijlpark and in 1991 he was the deputy headmaster\nof a school\r\nin Potchefstroom. In the criminal case referred to he is charged with\r\nthe rape of a schoolgirl during 1985 and the\nindecent assault, during\r\n1991, of a schoolgirl who was in matric at the time.\n[3]\tOne of the\r\nwitnesses called by the state was the husband of the complainant in\r\nrespect of the indecent assault charge, Mr Smit,\nwho was a teacher at\r\nthe Potchefstroom school where the appellant was the deputy\r\nheadmaster and the complainant a pupil. During\nhis cross-examination\r\nit was put to him that rumours of an affair between him and the\r\ncomplainant came to the knowledge of the\nappellant and that the\r\nappellant confronted him and the complainant with such rumours. Smit\r\ndenied these allegations as also an\nallegation that he asked the\r\nheadmaster for permission to accompany the complainant to the\r\nschoolâs matric dance. The purpose\nof the questions was presumably\r\nto show that Smit had an axe to grind with the appellant. Shortly\r\nthereafter the first respondent\nasked Smit what the name of the\r\nheadmaster was, to which he replied that it was Mr Awie van Rensburg.\r\nVan Rensburg was subsequently\ncalled as a witness. He denied that he\r\nwas aware of any of the alleged rumours.\n[4]\tAfter Van\r\nRensburg had started giving evidence the appellantâs attorney\r\nnoticed an entry in the case docket of the state which\nread:\nâ\nMnr\r\nAwie van Rensburg is woonagtig te Hermanus en LDS het opdrag gegee\r\nthat OB self met getuies konsulteer.â\nThe appellantâs\r\nattorney asked the investigating officer, Captain Potgieter, what\r\nâLDSâ stood for, to which she replied âdie\nlanddrosâ.\n[5]\tDuring an\r\nadjournment of the criminal trial and in front of the first\r\nrespondentâs office, the first respondent had a discussion\nwith a\r\ncolleague, Ms Schutte and an attorney, Dr De Kock. De Kock is a\r\nmember of the governing body of the HoÃ«r Volkskool Heidelberg\nand\r\nhad previously been involved in a disciplinary enquiry against the\r\nappellant who is the headmaster of the school and who had\nbeen\r\naccused of sexual misdemeanours. It is common cause that De Kock,\r\nwhose children attend the school, regard the appellant as\nâ`n\r\nremmende invloedâ at the school.\n[6]\tThe entry in\r\nthe docket and the admission by the first respondent during the\r\ncriminal trial of the evidence of Dr Irma Labuschagne\nformed the\r\nbasis of an application by the appellant, at the end of the state\r\ncase, for the recusal of the first respondent. The\nadmission of the\r\nevidence of Dr Labuschagne is, however, no longer relied upon as a\r\nground for the recusal of the first respondent\nconsequently nothing\r\nfurther need be said in respect thereof.\n[7]\tBoth the\r\nappellant and the state tendered evidence in respect of the\r\napplication for recusal. But, before the evidence was tendered,\nthe\r\nfirst respondent stated in open court that he denied that he ever\r\ncommunicated with the investigating officer. He stated that\nhe did\r\nnot know how it came about that the entry was made in the docket. The\r\nappellant thereafter tendered evidence in support\nof his application\r\nand it was only during the course of the hearing of such evidence\r\nthat the discussion between the first respondent\nand De Kock came to\r\nbe relied upon as an additional ground for the recusal of the first\r\nrespondent. Mr Minnaar gave evidence in\nrespect of the discussion.\r\nAccording to him the first respondent joined a discussion between\r\nSchutte and De Kock. The discussion\ntook place openly in front of the\r\nfirst appellantâs office and, except for a short while, when\r\nSchutte visited the bathroom,\nshe was present during the whole of the\r\ndiscussion. According to Schutte there were people in close\r\nproximity. She went to the\nbathroom to wash her hands and could not\r\nhave been away for more than a minute. The discussion was about a\r\nprosecutor and when\nshe returned she did not get the impression that\r\nsomething else had been discussed in her absence.\n[8]\tThe state\r\ncalled the prosecutor and the investigating officer to testify about\r\nthe entry in the docket. The investigating officer\nadmitted that she\r\ntold the appellantâs attorney that âLDSâ stood for âlanddrosâ\r\nbut stated that she used it as an abbreviation\nfor the state, the\r\nprosecutor or the court. She stated that she never spoke to the first\r\nrespondent and that she had not received\nan instruction from a\r\nmagistrate. The request that she should personally obtain a statement\r\nfrom Van Rensburg came from the prosecutor.\nThe prosecutor testified\r\nthat she could possibly have given the instruction to the\r\ninvestigating officer. It was never suggested\nto her that she\r\nreceived the instruction from the first respondent.\n[9]\tThe first\r\nrespondent dismissed the application for his recusal whereupon the\r\nappellant applied to the court below for his decision\nto be reviewed.\r\nIn his founding affidavit the appellant alleged that the admission of\r\nDr Labuscagneâs evidence and the entry\nin the docket indicated\r\nunequivocally that the first respondent was biased against him. He\r\nalleged furthermore that the evidence\nof Captain Potgieter during the\r\nhearing by the first respondent of the recusal application and the\r\ndiscussion between De Kock and\nthe first respondent created the\r\nimpression that the first respondent was biased against him.\n[10]\tThe first\r\nrespondent, in his answering affidavit, denied that he was biased\r\nagainst the appellant. In respect of the entry\nin the docket he\r\nreferred to the evidence led in respect of the recusal application\r\nand stated that the investigating officer never\nreceived the\r\ninstruction from a magistrate. In respect of the conversation with De\r\nKock he stated that the conversation was not\nabout the appellantâs\r\ncriminal case and annexed a supporting affidavit by De Kock\r\nconfirming that that was the case.\n[11]\tThe court\r\nbelow held that it was clear on the evidence that the first\r\nrespondent had not given an instruction to the investigating\nofficer\r\nto consult with Van Rensburg and also that the first respondent had\r\nnot discussed the appellantâs case with De Kock.\nHe held that any\r\nsuspicion of bias on the part of the first respondent was not based\r\non reasonable grounds.\n[12]\tOn appeal\r\nbefore us the appellant applied for leave to introduce new evidence.\r\nThe evidence he wished to introduce was that\nof his attorney. It was\r\nto the effect that another attorney, Mr Okes, informed him âoff the\r\nrecordâ, during the time that the\napplication for recusal was being\r\nheard, that the first respondent had told him that he had given the\r\ninstruction that the investigating\nofficer should personally obtain a\r\nstatement from a state witness. Okes told him that the first\r\nrespondent sought his advice in\nthis regard. Because the appellantâs\r\nattorney thought that there was sufficient evidence for a recusal he\r\ndid not disclose his\nconversation with Okes to the appellant until\r\nafter the dismissal of the recusal application. The first respondent\r\nfiled an answering\naffidavit and also an affidavit by Okes in which\r\nthese allegations are denied.\n[13]\tWe\r\ndismissed the application to lead further evidence. In terms of s 22\r\nof the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959 this court has\nthe power on the\r\nhearing of an appeal to receive further evidence. However, in the\r\ninterests of finality the power that this court\nhas will only be\r\nexercised if it is satisfied that the interests of justice would be\r\nbest served by receiving the evidence. It\nis generally accepted that\r\nthe following test should be applied:\nâ\n(a)\tThere\r\nshould be some reasonably sufficient explanation, based on\r\nallegations which may be true, why the evidence which it is\nsought to\r\nlead was not led at the trial.\n(b)\tThere\r\nshould be a\nprima\r\nfacie\nlikelihood of the truth of the evidence.\n(c)\tThe\r\nevidence should be materially relevant to the outcome of the trial.â\n(See\nS\r\nv De Jager\n1965 (2) SA 612\n(A) at 613C-E)\n[14]\tThe\r\nappellant failed to satisfy us of requirements (a) and (b). The\r\nevidence of the appellantâs attorney is hearsay evidence\nthat will\r\nnot be confirmed by Okes and is therefore inadmissible. In any event,\r\nif it is true that Okes told the appellantâs\nattorney what he is\r\nalleged to have told him, he is a thoroughly unreliable witness as he\r\nis now denying under oath that he did\nso. Yet another reason why it\r\nis unlikely that the evidence will be accepted as true is the\r\nimprobability that the first respondent,\nwhile an application for his\r\nrecusal was pending, would have told Okes, an attorney, with whom he\r\nhad no special relationship,\nthat he had given the instruction. More\r\nso in the light of the fact that he had denied, in open court, that\r\nhe had given the instruction.\nThe appellantâs explanation for not\r\nhaving tendered âthe evidenceâ in the review application is also\r\nunacceptable. His attorney\nwas aware of the evidence and deliberately\r\ndecided not to make use thereof. A party cannot be allowed to\r\nwilfully withhold evidence,\nwait to see whether the outcome is\r\nfavourable and then, when it is not, have the case reopened.\n[15]\tIn my view\r\nthere is no basis upon which it can be held that the instruction to\r\nobtain a statement from Van Rensburg emanated\nfrom the first\r\nrespondent. Although the investigating officerâs note says that the\r\ninstruction came from a magistrate it did,\naccording to her, not come\r\nfrom a magistrate. The appellant criticised her evidence but even a\r\nrejection of her evidence does not\nassist the appellant. The position\r\nremains that there is no evidence that the instruction came from the\r\nfirst respondent while\nthere is the denial by the first respondent\r\nthat he gave the instruction. The appellant submitted that in the\r\nlight of the fact\nthat the first respondent elicited the name of Van\r\nRensburg he probably gave the instruction. There is no merit in this\r\ncontention.\nIt is common cause that once the identity of the\r\nheadmaster concerned had been established the prosecutor instructed\r\nthe investigation\nofficer to obtain a statement from him.  A finding\r\nthat it was the first respondent and not the prosecutor who gave the\r\ninstruction\nthat the investigating officer should personally obtain\r\nthe statement, is therefore wholly unjustified. There is no reason to\r\ndisbelieve\nthe first respondentâs evidence that he never gave the\r\ninstruction.\n[16]\tIn respect\r\nof the conversation between the first respondent and De Kock there is\r\nlikewise no basis upon which it can be held\nthat the first respondent\r\ndiscussed the appellantâs case with De Kock. On the evidence\r\npresented he did not do so.\n[17]\tIt follows\r\nthat there is no basis upon which it can be held that the first\r\nrespondent was actually biased against the appellant.\nThe question\r\nremains whether objectively there existed a reasonable apprehension\r\nthat the first respondent may be biased. The test\nfor recusal on that\r\nbasis was formulated as follows in\nPresident\r\nof the Republic of South Africa and Others v South African Rugby\r\nFootball Union and Others\n1999 (4) SA (CC) 147 at para 48:\nâ\nThe\r\nquestion is whether a reasonable, objective and informed person would\r\non the correct facts reasonably apprehend that the Judge\nhas or will\r\nnot bring an impartial mind to bear on the adjudication of the case,\r\nthat is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence\nand the submissions\r\nof counsel.â\nThe onus rests\r\non the appellant. On the evidence presented the correct facts are\r\nthat the first respondent did not give the relevant\ninstruction to\r\nthe investigating officer and that he had a conversation with De\r\nKock, in public, about a prosecutor and not about\nthe appellantâs\r\ncriminal case. On those facts there can be no question of a\r\nreasonable, objective person apprehending that the\nfirst respondent\r\nwould not bring an impartial mind to bear on the adjudication of the\r\ncase.\n[18]\tIn the\r\nresult the appeal is dismissed with costs.\n____________________________\nPE STREICHER\nJUDGE OF\r\nAPPEAL\nAppearances:\nFor\r\nAppellant:\tHP West\nInstructed by:\nLocketts\r\nAttorneys, Nigel\nNaudes,\r\nBloemfontein\nFor 1\nst\nRespondent:\tS M Lebala\nFor 2\nnd\nRespondent:\tL Pienaar\nInstructed by:\nState Attorney,\r\nPretoria\nState Attorney,\r\nBloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, Marthinus Botha, a former schoolteacher, faced charges of rape (1985) and indecent assault (1991). During the trial, a magistrate (the first respondent) was alleged to be biased because of a docket entry indicating a request for a statement from a witness and because the magistrate was heard discussing a prosecutor with Dr. De Kock, who had previously been involved in a disciplinary matter concerning Botha. Botha sought the magistrate’s recusal on the basis of these alleged contacts and the admission of evidence from Dr. Labuschagne.",
    "issues": "Whether there was a reasonable and objective apprehension of bias that justified the recusal of the magistrate; whether the alleged docket entry and the conversation with Dr. De Kock amounted to bias; and whether new evidence offered by Botha’s attorney could be admitted on appeal under s 22 of the Supreme Court Act.",
    "principles": "The court applied the test for apparent bias from President of the Republic v South African Rugby Football Union (1999), requiring that a reasonable, objective, and informed person would apprehend lack of impartiality. It also considered the criteria for admitting fresh evidence on appeal: a satisfactory explanation for its prior non‑admission, prima facie likelihood of truth, and material relevance. The Supreme Court Act s 22 powers were acknowledged but limited by the need for finality and justice.",
    "application": "Applying the bias test, the court found no evidence that the magistrate gave the instruction to the investigating officer or that the discussion with Dr. De Kock concerned the appellant’s case. The alleged docket entry was explained as an abbreviation not linking to the magistrate. The proposed fresh evidence was deemed inadmissible hearsay, lacking a proper explanation for its previous omission and lacking credibility. Consequently, the requirements for admitting new evidence were not met.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The magistrate’s recusal was not granted, and the original decision of the High Court stood."
