During August 2005, Raydin wrote to Bantry, formally\r\ninforming it of\nthe existence of the cracks and notifying it that an\r\nindependent contractor had been secured who had expressed the opinion\r\n' ...\nthat the majority of the cracks are related to poor\r\nconstruction'. The response from Bantry was that ' ... it is quite\r\nnormal for\nnew buildings to experience shrinkage and settlement\r\ncracks'. Bantry's letter continued ' ... we do not accept the\r\nallegations\nof \"poor construction\" '. The battle lines thus\r\ncame to be drawn between the parties, rendering applicable Clause\r\n40.0\nof the agreement, headed âSettlement of Disagreements and\r\nDisputesâ. To the extent here relevant, this clause provides:\n'\n40.1\tShould\r\nthere be any disagreement between the\nemployer\nor his\nagents\non the one hand and the\ncontractor\non the other arising out of or concerning this\nagreement\n,\r\nthe\ncontractor\nmay request the\nprincipal\nagent\nto determine such disagreement by a written decision to both parties.\r\n On submission of such a request a disagreement in respect\nof the the\r\nissues detailed therein shall be deemed to exist\n40.2\tThe\nprincipal\r\nagent\nshall give a\r\ndecision specifically in terms of 40.1 to the\nemployer\nand the\ncontractor\nwithin ten (10)\nworking\ndays\nof receipt of such a request. Such decision shall be final and\r\nbinding on the parties unless either party disputes the same in\nterms\r\nof 40.3\n40.3\tWhere there is no\nprincipal\nagent\nor should the\nprincipal\nagent\nfail to give a written decision within ten (10)\nworking\ndays\nor either party disputes the decision in terms of 40.2 by notice to\r\nthe other and the\nprincipal\nagent\nwithin ten (10)\nworking\ndays\nof receipt thereof a dispute shall be deemed to exist\n40.4\tA dispute shall be submitted to:\n40.4.1\tArbitration in terms of 40.6\r\nor, where the parties so agree, to mediation in terms of 40.5\nâ¦\n40.6\tWhere the dispute is submitted to arbitration:\n40.6.1\tThe arbitration shall be\r\nconducted according to the rules stated in the\nschedule\n40.6.2\tThe\narbitrator\nshall be the person appointed by the parties in the\nschedule\nor within ten (10)\nworking\ndays\nof the date of submission of the dispute to arbitration. Where the\r\nparties make no such appointment the\narbitrator\nshall be appointed by the [Chairman of the Association of\r\nArbitrators]\n40.6.3\tThe\narbitrator\nshall have the power to open or revise any certificate, opinion,\r\ndecision, requisition or notice relating to such dispute as if\nno\r\nsuch certificate, opinion, decision, requisition or notice had been\r\nissued or given\n40.6.4\tThe parties, unless otherwise\r\nagreed, shall request the\narbitrator\nto give a reasoned award\nâ¦\n'\n[3]\tA\ndisagreement thus\r\nhaving arisen in respect of the work performed by Bantry, it was\r\nfirst referred by the parties to the principal\nagent, the architect\r\nof the building project, Roger Davies, on 6 December 2005. On 8\r\nDecember 2005, Davies recommended that Bantry\nagree that the cracks\r\nwere unacceptable and that it undertake remedial work. He added\r\nsomewhat prophetically: 'we further request\nthe parties reach\r\nresolution and avoid unnecessary litigation'. Bantry, however,\r\nthrough Michael Wagner, its attorney of record,\ndisputed the\r\nprincipal agent's findings and formally declared a dispute to exist.\r\nThe parties accordingly agreed that the dispute\nbe referred to\r\narbitration. Victor Booth, an engineer, who was cited as the second\r\nrespondent in the court below but who took no\npart in the proceedings\r\neither in the court below or in this court, was duly appointed\r\narbitrator by the Chairman of the Association\nof Arbitrators. On 18\r\nApril 2006, the arbitrator convened what was termed the first\r\npreliminary meeting with the parties. At this\nmeeting the parties\r\nagreed, as emerges from the arbitrator's award, that the summary\r\nrules of the Association would be applicable\nto their arbitration.\n[4]\tOn 19 May 2006, Raydin filed its Statement of\r\nClaim and on 1 June 2006 Bantry filed its Statement of Defence. A\r\nsecond preliminary\nmeeting was held on 7 July 2006 and, a week later,\r\nthe arbitrator despatched to the parties a minute recording inter\r\nalia the following:\n'It was agreed that following this inspection and my\r\nhaving taken full cognisance of the experts' comments, as previously\r\nwritten,\nI would then be able to use my own knowledge and technical\r\nexpertise to decide upon the matter without the expense of a formal\r\nhearing.\nIt was agreed that there would be no right of appeal on\r\nmy award.\nEvidence,\nper\r\nse\n, will not be led\r\nat the\nin loco\ninspection beyond what is already embodied in the existing written\r\nreports. However, if, after the\nin\r\nloco\ninspection,\r\nthe parties' respective experts wish to add anything further to their\r\nprevious written statements and/or to confirm\nanything that may have\r\nbeen said on site and to lead such statements as additional evidence,\r\nI will allow 5 working days for a\nfurther such written submission\r\nfrom each.\nThe time limits for the award protocol will follow the\r\nrecommendations in the \"Rules\" of the Association of\r\nArbitrators.\nViz. my award will be published within 20 working days\r\nafter the last evidence was received.'\n[5]\tOn 27 July 2006, an\nin\r\nloco\ninspection was held. Thereafter\r\nthe arbitrator sought and obtained a report from the project\r\nengineer. He also requested certain\ndrawings. On 6 September 2006 the\r\narbitrator received the requested drawings and on 14 September 2006\r\nhe wrote to both attorneys:\nâ\nI have not yet had the\r\nopportunity to look at the documents as the delay has put many other\r\nitems on my day agenda and I have been\nout of town a great deal. I am\r\nsure that copies of what I have received will be made available to\r\nall concerned. In the interests\nof the fairness of the procedure I\r\nbelieve that I should wait for all to be in possession of these same\r\ndocuments before I proceed.\n'\nThereafter correspondence was exchanged\nregarding the quality of some of the drawings. On 28 November 2006,\r\nthe arbitrator despatched a letter to the parties stating 'I\nhave\r\nsome questions to be answered if we are to resolve this before\r\n06-12-2006 after which I am away for four weeks'.\n[6]\tIn the meanwhile, during December 2006,\r\ncertain remedial work was undertaken at the premises. Thereafter and\r\nin response to\na request from the arbitrator, the architect submitted\r\na report in which he opined that 'the cause of the cracks and defects\r\nwere\nnot as a result of the absence of detail . . ., but as a direct\r\nresult of the failure by the contractor to carry out the construction\n\nin a proper manner and the improper use of materials and defective\r\nmaterials in the construction'. The architect added:\n'\nThe\r\nphotographs taken when repairs were effected clearly illustrate\r\ndefective construction relating to the brickwork and plastering.\nAny\r\nreasonable contractor would agree that it is poor common brickwork\r\nwhen over a small area plaster thickness vary from 15mm\nto 40mm and\r\nbrickwork joints vary from 6mm to 50mm. My concern is that the\r\nContractor made no effort to investigate the problems\nwhen first\r\nhighlighted.... we note that it is neither a large nor a complicated\r\nbuilding.'\n[7]\tThat report elicited the following response from Bantry's\r\nattorney:\n'We are of the view that [the\r\narchitect's] response, seen as a whole, does not provide any\r\nevidence\n, aside from\r\nspeculation on his part, that the cracks were due to latent defects\r\nfor which our client is liable.'\nOn 8 January 2007, the arbitrator wrote 'I'm sure\r\nthat we would all like to bring this to a conclusion and await the\r\ninfo previously\nrequested'.  In correspondence addressed to the\r\narbitrator dated 16 February 2007, Raydin's attorney\n,\r\nAlec Drobis, wrote: 'I trust that you are now in possession of what\r\nyou have called for in order to render your decision'. On\n19 March\r\n2007, Drobis once again enquired when the arbitrator would be in a\r\nposition to let them have his determination. On 28\nMarch 2007, the\r\narbitrator requested Raydin to fully and formally quantify the claim.\r\nIn response Raydin filed a damages affidavit\non 8 May 2007.  Two days\r\nlater, Wagener wrote to the arbitrator suggesting that he make his\r\naward in the following two stages:\nfirst, whether Bantry was liable\r\nat all and, if so, for which cracks. Once an award of that nature was\r\nmade, so the e-mail continued,\nBantry would be in a position to\r\nprovide its reasoned estimate of the cost of repairing the defects\r\nset out in the award.\n[8]\tOn 31 May 2007, the arbitrator, in an e-mail\r\nto both parties, stated:\n'I AM SURE THAT BOTH PARTIES NOW WANT CLOSURE ASAP.\nI WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOW\r\nVIEW THE REMEDIAL WORK AND BE FULLY INFORMED AS TO EXACTLY WHAT WORK\r\nWAS DONE AND WHERE. PLEASE\nADVISE WHO I CAN MEET AT THE PREMISES WITH\r\nTIME AND DATE. MAYBE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON COULD CONTACT ME DIRECTLY\r\nTO ARRANGE THIS.\nI WILL THEN HAVE A 21 WORKING DAYS TO DELIBERATE AND\r\nPRESENT MY AWARD.'\nWith referen\nce to that\r\ne-mail, the arbitrator wrote on 4 June 2007:\n'I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PARTIES'\r\nCONFIRMATION AS REQUESTED. HOWEVER MR MIDGIN\n[the\r\nChief Executive Officer of Raydin] RANG ME ON 01-06-2007 AND SAID\r\nTHAT HE WOULD SHOW THE REMEDIAL WORK TO ME.\nDOES [BANTRY] WISH TO BE REPRESENTED AT THE ASSESSMENT?\nPLEASE ADVISE ASAP SO THAT I CAN ARRANGE A TIME AND DATE\r\nTO MEET MR MIDGIN ETC'.\n[9]\tWagener responded that his\nclient did indeed wish to be represented at the inspection and\r\nfurnished the arbitrator with the contact details of a certain Bob\n\nWagener. He furthermore drew attention to his earlier e-mail (which\r\nhad apparently gone unanswered) that had suggested that the\n\narbitrator's award should be made in two stages. He then proceeded to\r\narticulate what he described as three concerns that had been\nraised\r\nby his client. Those were:\n'1\tThe inordinate length of time\nit\r\nhas taken to obtain an Award.\n2\tThe fact that you appear to be communicating directly\r\nwith Mr Midgin.  My client would like the assurance from you that\r\nthere\nare no current or prior dealings between you and Mr Midgin.\n3\tYour expressed desire to view the\r\nremedial work already carried out appears to be an indication that\r\nyou have already decided\nthat my client is liable for the cracks.'\n[10]\tThe next morning, the arbitrator apologised\r\nfor the oversight in not replying to the e-mail in question. He\r\nrecorded that he\nhad noted the suggestion that the arbitration award\r\nbe made in two stages.  Some 40 minutes later he replied to the three\r\nconcerns\nthus:\n'1\tThe inordinate length of time it has taken to obtain\r\nan Award;\nIT IS MY RECOLLECTION THAT THE TIME FRAME HAS,\r\nGENERALLY, NOT BEEN DETERMINED BY ME BUT BY THE LONG RESPONSE TIMES\r\nOF THE PARTIES\nTO VARIOUS ISSUES.\nTHE HISTORICAL CHAIN OF CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BEAR\r\nTESTIMONY TO THAT.\n2\tThe fact that you appear to be communicating directly\r\nwith Mr Midgin. My client would like the assurance from you that\r\nthere are\nno current or prior dealings between you and Mr Midgin.\nI HAVE HAD ONE BRIEF PHONE\r\nCONVERSATION FROM MR. MIDGIN WHEREIN HE REQUESTED THAT HE COULD BE\r\nTHE PERSON TO SHOW THE REMEDIAL WORK\nTO ME. I IMMEDIATELY SENT AN\r\nEMAIL TO THE PARTIES ADVISING THEM OF THIS REQUEST AND CONFIRMATION\r\nOF A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE OTHER\nSIDE.\nI WILL BE CONTACTING BOTH MR. MIDGIN\r\nAND MR. BOB WAGENER EARLY NEXT WEEK. PLEASE LET ME HAVE MR. WAGENER'S\r\nEMAIL ADDRESS SO THAT,\nAS I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, I CAN COPY\r\nEVERBODY WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MR. MIDGIN'S\r\nPHONE CALL TO ME IS\nBEING CONSTRUED IN A SINISTER LIGHT.\nI DID ASSUME THAT HE HAD HIS\r\nATTORNEY'S PERMISSION TO DO THIS AND THAT IT HAD BEEN CLEARED WITH\r\nYOURSELVES IN AN ATTEMPT TO NOW\nSPEED THINGS ALONG.\nI HAVE NEVER MET MR. MIDGIN, HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HIM\r\nAND I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM BEFORE IN MY LIFE.\n3\tYour expressed desire to view the remedial work\r\nalready carried out appears to be an indication that you have already\r\ndecided\nthat my client is liable for the cracks.\nSURELY, MY WISH TO SEE THE REPAIR\r\nWORK SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A NORMAL ACTIVITY IN THE WHOLE CHAIN OF\r\nEVENTS AND NOT DOING SO WOULD\nPROBABLY ATTRACT CRITICISM. I CAN\r\nASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NOT MADE ANY DECISION ON LIABILTY AND, AFTER\r\nMUCH ELAPSED TIME, I WILL\nREFAMILIARISE MYSELF WITH ALL ASPECTS OF\r\nTHE DISPUTE BEFORE MAKING ANY DETERMINATION.'\nTh\nat afternoon, Wagener\r\nwrote in an e-mail to the arbitrator: 'Having gone through our\r\nrecords we note that you have conducted an\ninspection\nin\nloco\non 27\r\nJuly 2006. Kindly provide us with a report on that visit as well as a\r\nfresh report on your proposed 2nd visit to the site'.\nThat elicited\r\nthe following response: 'Arbitrators don't write reports. They\r\nconsider the evidence and, using their expertise,\nwhen given\r\npermission to do so (as is the case here), and a judgment, make a\r\nreasoned award.'\n[11]\tOn 8 June 2007, Wagener wrote to the arbitrator:\n'I regret to inform you that you\nr\r\nreply to my e-mail of 7 June 2007 is in conflict with both Rule\r\n31.1.4 of the Rules for the Conduct of Arbitrations promulgated\nby\r\nthe Association of Arbitrators (Southern Africa) as well as the\r\ncommon law. Insofar as you have exceeded the time limit contained\nin\r\ns 23 of the Arbitration Act for making your award by a substantial\r\nmargin, the arbitration has lapsed.'\nI\nn response, on 13 June\r\n2007, the arbitrator wrote to the parties:\n'\nRules\r\nfor the conduct of arbitrations\nRule 31.1.4 states that, \"the arbitrator shall\r\nrecord his observations â¦â¦â¦.. in such a manner as he may decide\r\nand such\nrecord â¦â¦â¦.. shall form part of the proceedings of the\r\narbitration\".\nThis is not to be construed as him having to supply a\r\n\"report\" to the parties.\nArbitrations Act No. 42 (1965)\nClause 13 (1)\n\"the appointment of an arbitrator â¦â¦â¦.. shall\r\nnot be capable of being terminated except by the consent of all the\r\nparties.\"\nShould the claimant also wish to dispense with my\r\nservices then this clause may be invoked.\nClause 13 (2)(a)\nUpon application the court may set aside my appointment\r\n\"on good cause shown\".\nHowever, due to the protracted series of events caused\r\nby the parties' own delays in providing certain documents etc. the\r\ncourt\nwould probably not consider this to be \"on good cause\r\nshown\".\nFurthermore, I refer you to clause 40.2 of the \"Rules\"\r\nwhich requires any objection to be lodged promptly or the right\nto\r\nobject will be considered as waived. There are many aspects of this\r\narbitration which tacitly fall into this category.\nClause 23\nMy e-mail to the parties dated 31\nst\nMay, 2007 is relevant.\nBoth parties have communicated freely\r\nfor many months until the 6\nth\nJune 2007 and tacitly accepted the content of my e-mail dated 31\nst\nMay, 2007 which stated that I would deliver my award 21 days after my\r\nfinal inspection, once that had been arranged. I refer you\nto M.\r\nWagener's email dated 4\nth\nJune and Drobis's e-mail dated 6\nth\nJune.\nThe inspection is now delayed due to\r\nthe respondent's recent dissatisfaction and this issue must be\r\nresolved before I can continue.\nBoth parties to now advise me to continue or otherwise.'\n[12]\tThe arbitrator's letter prompted the\r\nfollowing missive from Wagener:\n'We regret to record that our client is dissatisfied\r\nwith your conduct of the arbitration on a number of grounds including\r\nyour\nfailure to provide us with an account of your findings with\r\nregard to the first inspection carried out by you.\nWe record further that, to date, you have not responded\r\nto our request to have the proceedings decided in two stages, i.e.\r\nliability\nand quantum.\nWe are of the respectful view that the provisions of\r\nsection 23 of the Arbitration Act are peremptory and override the\r\nrules to\nwhich you refer in your letter.\nIn the circumstances, our client maintains its position\r\nthat the arbitration has lapsed and can only be revived by the court\r\non\ngood cause shown.\nOur client will oppose any such application to the\r\ncourt.'\n[13]\tUnbowed, the arbitrator asserted:\n'AD PARA 2\nI reiterate my e-mail response to you\r\nof 07-06-2007 that Arbitrators do not write reports but that their\r\nobservations at an\nin\r\nloco\ninspection\r\nwill be taken into account in the award.\nAD PARA 3\nI did respond to this in my other e-mail dated\r\n07-06-2007 and advised you that \"your suggestion is noted\".\nAD PARA 4\nBoth parties agreed, voluntarily, to enter into the\r\narbitration procedure and to be governed by the rules and that the\r\nsummary rules\nwill apply. I REITERATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF ELAPSED TIME\r\nHAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE AND ONCE AGAIN REFER\r\nYOU\nTO RULE 40.2 WHEREBY ANY PARTY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO ANY OBJECTION\r\nON PROVISIONS IF NOT DONE SO PROMPTLY.\nI WILL NOW BE AWAY UNTIL 2\nND\nJULY 2007 AT WHICH TIME I WILL DETERMINE THE EARLIEST MUTUALLY\r\nACCEPTABLE TIME AND DATE FOR MY INSPECTION OF THE REMEDIAL WORK.\nDUE\r\nTO THE DELAY IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE PAST 10 DAYS CAUSED BY THE\r\nRESPONDENT'S RECALCITRANCE TO PROCEED AND THE OBJECTIONS\nTHERETO,\r\nWHICH I HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH, I WILL THEN CONTINUE WITH OR WITHOUT\r\nTHE RESPONDENT'S ATTENDANCE.\nBOTH PARTIES ARE HEREBY GIVEN DUE\r\nNOTICE OF THIS\n.'\n[14]\tOn 19 June 2007, Wagener wrote to Dobris that\r\nneither he nor the arbitrator had dealt with the provisions of s 23\r\nof the Arbitration\nAct, which were, according to him, peremptory.  He\r\nreiterated that the arbitration had lapsed, which required a formal\r\napplication\nto court for it to be revived. He concluded 'Our client\r\nwill not be taking further part in the arbitration and you proceed at\r\nyour\nown risk'. On 6 July 2007, the arbitrator visited the premises\r\nto examine the remedial work. That effectively being the last piece\n\nof evidence considered by him in the conduct of the arbitration, the\r\narbitrator then handed down his award 20 days later on 3 August\n2007.\r\nHe found for Raydin and ordered Bantry to pay damages in the sum of\r\nR124 900, plus 50% of the arbitration costs, plus VAT,\nplus interest\r\nfrom 3 August 2007.\n[15]\tAs the award remained unsatisfied, Raydin\r\napproached the High Court (Johannesburg) for the arbitrator's award\r\nto be made an\norder of court in terms of s 31(1) of the Arbitration\r\nAct.\n1\nBantry opposed the relief sought. It filed an affidavit of some six\r\npages in answer. Much of what was contained in Raydin's founding\n\naffidavit was not responded to, much less challenged or disputed.\r\nInstead, Bantry contented itself with a recital of the correspondence\n\nexchanged during the arbitration process.\n[16\n]\tThe gist of its\r\nopposition is to be found in the following four brief paragraphs\r\nunder the heading âGross Irregularities or\nMisconduct on behalf of\r\nthe [Arbitrator]â (my numbering):\n'(i)\n.\tThe\r\nsecond respondent failed to provide the parties with information\r\nregarding his observations during inspections in loco on\n27 July 2006\r\nand 6 July 2007.\n(ii)\n.\tHe\r\ncommitted a gross irregularity in that he failed to identify the\r\ncracks for which the first respondent was liable and secondly\nto give\r\nthe first respondent an opportunity to tender evidence on the\r\nreasonable cost of repairing such cracks.\n(iii)\n.\tHe\r\ncontinued with the arbitration after it had lapsed.\n(iv)\n.\tHe\r\nwas not empowered to make the arbitrary financial adjustments\r\ncontained in his award. Rather he was required to identify the\ncracks\r\nand to apportion liability on a rational basis.'\nThe affidavit then concludes:\n'In the premises it is respectfully submitted that the\r\napplication to have the award made an order of court should be set\r\naside\nwith costs.'\n[17\n]\tIn its replying\r\naffidavit, Raydin took issue with Bantry's failure to launch a\r\ncounter-application to review and set aside the\narbitrator's award.\r\nOnly then did Bantry file a counter-application that the award of the\r\narbitrator be set aside, supported by\na three page affidavit\r\ndescribed as âan affidavit in support of [an] application for\r\ncondonationâ. With reference to the final\nparagraph of its earlier\r\nanswering affidavit, the later affidavit states: 'It would have been\r\nclear that . . . [Bantry] was in\nfact applying to have the award of\r\n[the arbitrator] set aside and not the \"application\" '. It\r\ncontinued 'All the grounds\non which [Bantry] relies to set aside the\r\n[arbitrator's] award are set out in my answering affidavit.' Bantry\r\naccordingly submitted\nthat the 'answering affidavit is in the form of\r\na counter-application'.\n[18]\tGoldstein J granted the relief sought in the\r\nmain application. In his judgment he made no reference whatsoever to\r\nthe counter-application\nor the condonation that was sought by Bantry\r\nin respect of its failure to timeously launch the\r\ncounter-application.\n[\n19]\tI have set out the\r\nfactual matrix in greater detail than is absolutely necessary because\r\nit illustrates, the extent to which\nBantryâs case appeared to shift\r\nwith the passage of time. Moreover, as is readily apparent, the four\r\nprincipal contentions advanced\nin opposition in the court below, of\r\nwhich only the first and fourth were pressed on appeal, amounted to\r\nno more than conclusions\nthat were devoid of any factual foundation.\n[20]\tI will nonetheless very briefly consider each\r\nof the two contentions advanced before us on behalf of Bantry. As set\r\nout in\nits heads of argument, they are:\n(a)\nâThe\r\narbitrator refused to make known to the parties the evidence obtained\r\nat the two inspections in loco prior to his award.\nThis evidence\r\nrelates to what was seen by the arbitrator and what was said by the\r\nexperts nominated by the parties who accompanied\nhim on his\r\ninspectionâ:\nThere is nothing in the arbitratorâs award to\r\nsuggest that he did in fact rely on any relevant information secured\r\nduring the\ninspections, as opposed to information gleaned from other\r\nsources such as the reports that had been furnished to him by the\r\nparties.\nThat much is made plain by the\r\narbitrator in the introductory comments of his award where he states:\r\nâIt is my duty to present\nmy award based on the written and oral\r\nevidence provided by the parties and their representatives â¦ It\r\nmust also be recorded\nthat it was agreed that I could use my own\r\ntechnical expertise in arriving at my conclusions and my awardâ.\r\nAfter all, it was\nfor Bantry to show that the arbitrator had seen\r\nsomething at the inspection that he had relied upon in determining\r\nthe dispute\nbetween the parties. That it had failed to do.\n(b)\nâIn\r\nassessing the quantum of the claim he acted on caprice and failed to\r\napply his mind to the factsâ:\nNo\nevidence whatsoever\r\nhas been adduced in support of the contention that the arbitrator had\r\nacted capriciously. Quite the contrary,\nMr Wagener conceded quite\r\ncandidly that the award was a properly reasoned one. Instead we were\r\nasked to infer capriciousness by\nvirtue of the following: Raydin had\r\nsubmitted a damages affidavit alleging that the fair and reasonable\r\ncost of repairing the cracks\nwas R149 900. From that figure the\r\narbitrator had deducted and then added back certain amounts. In so\r\ndoing, so the argument\nwent, the arbitrator had exceeded his mandate\r\nand had acted arbitrarily. But that could hardly be so. In his award\r\nthe arbitrator\nstated: âI find the rates quoted for the repair work\r\n[R149 900] not to be unreasonableâ. Quite clearly that\r\ndetermination\nfell within his mandate and, were he to have ended\r\nthere, there would have been no cause for complaint. That being so,\r\nas the subsequent\ndeduction and adding back operated to benefit\r\nrather than prejudice Bantry, it could hardly - from its perspective\r\nâ be labelled\ncapricious.\n[21]\tThe legal principles applicable to an enquiry\r\nof this kind were recently set out by Harms JA on behalf of this\r\ncourt.\n2\nIt is not necessary to recapitulate those principles. Suffice it to\r\nstate that once again a litigant has fundamentally misconceived\nthe\r\nnature of its relief. The parties here had waived the right to have\r\ntheir dispute re-litigated or reconsidered. Given the nature\nof\r\nBantryâs opposition, it was for it to challenge the award by\r\ninvoking the statutory review provisions of s 33(1) of the Act.\nIt\r\nill-behoved Bantry to adopt the passive attitude that it did. It\r\nought instead to have taken the initiative and applied to court\nto\r\nhave the award set aside within six weeks of the publication of the\r\naward or alternatively to have launched a proper counter-application\n\nfor such an order.\n3\nHad that been done then the arbitrator could have entered the fray\r\nand defended himself against the allegations levelled by Bantry,\n\ninstead of it falling to Raydin to do so on his behalf â a most\r\ninvidious position for any litigant.\n[22]\tIt follows that the learned Judge in the court below cannot be\r\nfaulted and in the result the appeal must fail. It is accordingly\n\ndismissed with costs.\n____________________\nV M  PONNAN\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nAppellant:\t\t\t\tWagener (Attorney)\nInstructed\r\nby:\nBowman\r\nGilfillan Attorneys\nCape\r\nTown\nMatsepe\r\nInc\nBloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent:\t\t\tA Kemack\nInstructed\r\nby:\nDrobis\r\n& Associates\nSandton\nNaudes\r\nAttorneys\nBloemfontein\n1\nAct 42 of 1965.\n2\nTelcordia Technologies Inc v Telkom Ltd\n[2006] ZASCA 112\n;\n2007 (3) SA 266\n(SCA); see also\nLufuno Mphaphuli & Associates (Pty) Ltd v\r\n\tAndrews and Another\n[2007] ZASCA 143\n;\n2008 (2) SA 448\n(SCA).\n3\nButler & Finsen\nArbitration in South Africa: Law and Practice\npara\n7.10.",

    "facts": "In March 2004 Raydin Investments contracted Bantry Construction Services to erect a factory and offices in Johannesburg. After completion, cracks appeared in plaster and floor toppings. Raydin notified Bantry in August 2005, alleging poor construction. The parties invoked Clause 40 of their contract, referring the dispute to the principal agent, who suggested remedial work. Bantry disputed the finding, and the matter was referred to arbitration. Victor Booth was appointed arbitrator. A series of preliminary meetings, site inspections (27 July 2006 and 6 July 2007), and exchanges of documents and correspondence ensued over more than a year, marked by delays, objections, and requests for a two‑stage award. On 3 August 2007 the arbitrator issued an award in favour of Raydin, ordering Bantry to pay R124 900 plus costs and interest. Raydin then sought to have the award made an order of court under s31(1) of the Arbitration Act. Bantry opposed, raising alleged irregularities and arguing that the arbitration had lapsed under s23, but failed to file a timely counter‑application.",
    "issues": "The principal issues were: (1) Whether the arbitrator’s award could be made an order of court despite Bantry’s allegations of procedural irregularities and its claim that the arbitration had lapsed; (2) Whether Bantry waived its right to challenge the award by failing to lodge a review application within the statutory six‑week period prescribed by s33(1) of the Arbitration Act; and (3) Whether the court should set aside the award on the basis of the alleged misconduct of the arbitrator.",
    "principles": "The court applied the Arbitration Act, particularly s31(1) (making an award an order of court), s33(1) (review of an award) and s23 (time limits for making an award). It emphasized that parties must invoke the statutory review provisions within six weeks of the award’s publication; failure to do so results in a waiver of the right to set aside the award. The court also reiterated that waiving the right to re‑litigate a dispute is a substantive waiver, and that the arbitrator’s procedural conduct, absent proof of bias or jurisdictional excess, does not by itself invalidate the award.",
    "application": "The court found that Bantry never filed a proper application for review or a counter‑application within the six‑week period, despite having the opportunity to do so after the award was issued on 3 August 2007. Consequently, Bantry was deemed to have waived its right to challenge the award. The alleged procedural irregularities—failure to provide inspection reports or to split the award—did not amount to a peremptory breach of the Arbitration Act. Accordingly, the High Court’s order making the award enforceable was upheld.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The arbitrator’s award was confirmed as an order of court, and Bantry Construction Services was bound to pay the sum awarded to Raydin Investments."
