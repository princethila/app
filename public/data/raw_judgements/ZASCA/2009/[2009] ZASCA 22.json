The first\r\nrespondent is the Head of Department of Education in\nMpumalanga (head\r\nof department) and the eighth respondent is the Minister of Education\r\nof Mpumalanga. They are the only respondents\nopposing the appeal. The\r\nsecond to sixth respondents are members of an interim committee\r\nappointed by the head of department to\ndetermine the language policy\r\nof the school. The seventh respondent is the principal of the school.\r\nThe ninth respondent is a parent\nof one of the learners who sought\r\ntuition in English and was joined for purposes of one of the interim\r\napplications that do not\nfeature in this appeal.\n[2]\nThe\r\nappellants applied in the court a quo (Ngoepe JP, Seriti J and\r\nRanchod AJ sitting as a court of first instance) for an order\n\nreviewing and setting aside three decisions:\n1\nthe decision of the head of department to withdraw the function of\r\nthe governing body to determine the language policy of the school;\n\nthe appointment by the head of department of an interim committee to\r\nchange the language policy of the school; and the decision\nof the\r\ninterim committee to change the language policy of the school from an\r\nAfrikaans medium school to a parallel medium school.\nThe court a quo\r\ndismissed the application for leave to appeal. The appellants\r\nsubsequently obtained leave from this court.\n[3]\nThis\r\ncase is not, as at first blush appears, about language policy at\r\nschools, a highly emotive issue in the South African context,\nbut\r\nrather about the principle of legality and the proper exercise of\r\nadministrative power.\n[4]\nThe\r\nstrife between the department of education, the school and its\r\ngoverning body about its language policy started as far back\nas 2001.\r\nEvents during the course of that year culminated in the head of\r\ndepartment suspending the principal and disbanding the\ngoverning body\r\nof the school on 12 December 2001, the afternoon after school broke\r\nup for the December holidays. Following the\nsuspension the head of\r\ndepartment appointed an acting principal and promptly instructed him\r\nboth to change the language policy\nof the school and to admit\r\nlearners to the school to be taught in English.\n[5]\nLitigation\r\nbetween, amongst others, the principal and the governing body of the\r\nschool on the one hand and the head of department\non the other hand,\r\nachieved the reinstatement of the principal and the governing body\r\nearly in January 2002 in terms of a judgment\nby Moseneke J in\nSchoonbee\r\nv MEC for Education, Mpumalanga.\n2\nOne\r\nhundred and thirty-two charges were compiled by the department\r\nagainst the principal, but were never pursued.\n[6]\nAt\r\nthe beginning of 2006 the department approached the school to enrol\r\n27 grade 8 learners who had to be taught in English.  A compromise\n\nwas reached: the learners were enrolled at a neighbouring English\r\nmedium school but accommodated on the premises of the school.\nAt the\r\nbeginning of 2007 those learners were all accommodated in English\r\nmedium schools in the area.\n[7]\nDuring\r\n2006 it was evident that there was a need for English tuition in the\r\nErmelo circuit beyond the available capacity. The department\nwas\r\naware of this at the time as the head of department wrote to the\r\nschool on 1 March 2007 that:\nâ\nYou\r\nwill recall that in 2006 my department had a crisis of the learners\r\nfor the Grade 8 level who could not be accommodated in all\nthe\r\nschools\nwithin the Ermelo 1 Circuitâ.\nIt came as no\r\nsurprise when, on 15 Augus\nt\r\n2006, the manager of the Ermelo circuit of the department wrote to\r\nthe principals of all schools in the circuit as follows:\nâ\nYou\r\nwill recall that in 2006, a Grade 8 English Medium Class of\r\napproximately 46 learners could not get accommodation at Ligbron\n\nAcademy of Technology and Ermelo Combined School since these are the\r\nonly institutions in the Circuit where English\nFIRST\nLanguage is utilized as medium of instruction in Grade 8 â 12. This\r\nstill remains a crisis.\nAgainst this background,\r\nthe Circuit would therefore request each and every principal to give\r\nadvice as to what other avenues could\nbe explored to resolve\r\naccommodation crisis in 2007 in our circuit schools, specifically for\r\nFirst English Medium Grade 8 learners.â\n[8]\nSuggestions\r\nwere made in response to the invitation to utilise the old âKommandoâ\r\nbuilding, the âconventâ and the âSpoornet\nbuildingâ. Those\r\nsuggestions all entailed the establishment of a new school in\r\nseparate premises to provide a long term solution\nfor the growing\r\nnumber of learners requiring tuition in English. None of these\r\nsuggestions found favour with the department, as\n(according to the\r\nanswering affidavit deposed to by the head of department) the\r\nbuildings âdo not fall under the jurisdiction\nof the department and\r\nwould have to be rented or acquired from their present owners.  They\r\nwould also require substantial renovations\nin order to make them\r\nsuitable as classroom facilities for learnersâ.\n[9]\nThe\r\nmatter apparently received no further attention from the department\r\nuntil Monday 8 January 2007, two days before the official\nopening of\r\nschools in the Ermelo circuit for the new academic year. On that day\r\nthe principal and the chairperson of the school\ngoverning body were\r\nsummoned to a meeting with the head of department to be held the\r\nfollowing day. The head of department did\nnot attend the meeting but\r\nsent officials who handed a letter to the principal in terms of which\r\nhe was instructed âto admit\nlearners [to be taught in English] at\r\nHoërskool Ermelo for the 2007 academic year with effect from\r\n10/01/2007â, contrary\nto the language policy of the school.\n[10]\nOn\r\n10 January 2007 a group of learners that required tuition in English,\r\ntheir parents and officials from the department arrived\nat the school\r\nfor the purpose of enrolling the learners. The principal, on the\r\nexpress written instruction of the chairman of the\ngoverning body,\r\nadhered to the language policy of the school, with the result that\r\nthe pupils were not enrolled and school commenced\nwithout them.\n[11]\nOn\r\nThursday 25 January 2007 the head of department addressed a letter in\r\nterms of s 25 of the Act to the second to sixth respondents\n(to whom\r\nI shall refer collectively as âthe interim committeeâ) informing\r\nthem of the issue between the department and the\nschool and\r\nappointing them âwith immediate effect to determine the language\r\npolicy of Hoërskool Ermeloâ. In the last paragraph\nof the\r\nletter the members of the interim committee were ârequested to\r\nensure that the Language policy determined by yourself\nwill enable\r\nthe learners to be admitted at Hoërskool Ermelo as a matter of\r\nurgencyâ. The interim committee was also called\nupon, albeit not in\r\nthe letter, to attend a meeting at 12:00 on the same day. At the\r\nmeeting an official of the department (who\ndeposed to an affidavit in\r\nthese proceedings confirming this) told the members of the interim\r\ncommittee that they were appointed\nto revise the language policy of\r\nthe Ermelo High School, in order to make it possible for the 113\r\nlearners who cannot be accommodated\nelsewhere to attend the said\r\nschool. At 14:30 that very day, after the conclusion of the meeting\r\nof the interim committee,\n3\na letter from the head of department to the school governing body,\r\npurporting to have been written in terms of s 22 of the Act,\nwas\r\ndelivered to the school. It said that the head of department had\r\nâdecided to withdraw [the governing bodyâs] function of\n\ndetermining the language policy of the âHoërskoolâ Ermelo\r\nwith immediate effectâ.\n[12]\nAt\r\nthe meeting of the interim committee it was decided that the language\r\npolicy of the school be changed. The formulation of the\nnew language\r\npolicy took place after the meeting and ultimately read, â[t]he\r\nlanguage of teaching and learning at the school\nwill be English and\r\nAfrikaans (Parallel Medium)â. It was common cause that this\r\ndecision was taken without consultation with\nrelevant parties or the\r\ngathering of relevant information other than information supplied by\r\nrepresentatives of the department\nat the meeting.\n[13]\nThe\r\nappellants rushed to court to obtain interim relief pending a review\r\nof the respondentsâ decisions and actions, but were ultimately\n\nunsuccessful in all applications. In the result the language policy\r\nof the school has remained as amended by the interim committee.\n\nTwenty learners were admitted in 2007 in terms of the amended\r\nlanguage policy and are being taught in English. The appellant has\n\nundertaken that regardless of the outcome of this appeal, all\r\nlearners admitted in terms of the amended language policy will\r\nreceive\ntuition in English until the end of their school careers.\n[14]\nThese\r\nfacts show that the department of education has, since 2001, regarded\r\nchanging the language policy of the school as the solution\nto its\r\nobligation to provide tuition in English to learners. In his\r\nanswering affidavit the head of department emphasises the fact\nthat\r\nthe school has fewer learners per available classroom than any other\r\nschool in the Ermelo circuit. Whilst that fact may have\npresented an\r\nattractive option for the department it had to remind itself, before\r\naction was taken, that the right to receive tuition\nin English in a\r\npublic educational institution provided by the State,\n4\nif reasonably practicable, is a right against the State and not a\r\nright against each and every public school.\n5\nFurthermore, whatever action the head of department took that\r\ninvolved the school had to comply with the principle of legality\nas\r\ndetermined in the Act and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act\r\n3 of 2000 (PAJA).\n[15]\nWith\r\nregard to the particular action taken by the head of department it is\r\nuseful to first look at certain key provisions of the\nAct to get an\r\nappreciation of the composition of the governing body and its powers.\r\nThe Act vests in the governing body the governance\nof the school. The\r\ngoverning body âmay perform only such functions and obligations and\r\nexercise only such rights as [are] prescribed\nby the Actâ.\n6\nSection 6 of the Act grants authority to the governing body of a\r\npublic school to âdetermine the language policy of the school\n\nsubject to the Constitution,\n7\nthis Act and any applicable provincial lawâ on a non-racial basis\r\nwithin the norms and standards for language policy as determined\nby\r\nthe Minister of Education.\n8\nThe governing body comprises elected parents of learners, educators,\r\nmembers of staff who are not educators, learners, the principal\nin\r\nhis or her official capacity and co-opted members, without voting\r\nrights, provided that the number of parent members âmust\ncomprise\r\none more than the combined total of other members of a governing body\r\nwho have voting rightsâ.\n9\nThis composition of the governing body provides for broad\r\nparticipation in the decision-making process with particular emphasis\n\non the contribution by parents of learners.\n[16]\nAside from authorising the governing body to determine the language\r\npolicy, s 20 confers on it certain core functions that include\n\nadopting a constitution and a code of conduct for learners;\r\ndeveloping a mission statement; determining times of the school day;\n\nadministering and controlling the property of the school, and\r\nrecommending the appointment of educators and non-educator staff\nto\r\nthe head of department.\n[17]\nIn\r\naddition to these functions a governing body may apply in terms of s\r\n21 to the head of department to be allocated further functions.\nThis\r\napplication may be refused only if the governing body concerned does\r\nnot have the capacity to perform such functions effectively.\n10\nFunctions capable of allocation are those set out in s 21(1):\nâ\nSubject to this Act, a\r\ngoverning body may apply to the Head of Department in writing to be\r\nallocated any of the following functions:\nTo maintain and improve\r\n\tthe schoolâs property, and buildings and grounds occupied by the\r\n\tschool, including school hostels, if\napplicable;\nto determine the\r\n\textra-mural curriculum of the school and the choice of subject\r\n\toptions in terms of provincial curriculum policy;\nto purchase textbooks,\r\n\teducational materials or equipment for the school;\nto pay for services to\r\n\tthe school;\n(dA) to provide an adult\r\nbasic education and training class or centre subject to any\r\napplicable\nlaw; or\nother functions\r\n\tconsistent with this Act and any applicable provincial law.â\n[18]\nThese\r\nfunctions are either non-essential to the functioning of the school,\r\n(s 21(1)(dA)) or, if not allocated, are performed by\nthe department.\r\nIt is because the department is usually responsible for these\r\nfunctions that they can only be allocated to the\ngoverning body if\r\nthe latter has the capacity to perform them effectively. This is the\r\nonly sensible distinction between the functions\ncontained in s 21 and\r\nthose elsewhere in the Act.  If there was no distinction, there is no\r\nreason why the legislature would have\nmade separate provision for\r\nthem in s 21 instead of simply including them in s 20.\n[19\n]\t\r\nSection 22(1) authorises the head of department to withdraw a\r\nfunction of a governing body, on reasonable grounds.  In s 22(2)\nthe\r\nprocedure to be followed in the event of a withdrawal of a function\r\nis set out. It involves the furnishing of reasons, calling\nfor\r\nrepresentations and due consideration thereof. Section 22(3) provides\r\nfor the urgent withdrawal of a function and prescribes\na similar\r\nprocedure to s 22(2) except that it takes place after the urgent\r\nwithdrawal. Subsection (4) allows the head of department\nto reverse\r\nor suspend the urgent withdrawal of a function âfor sufficient\r\nreasonsâ.\n11\n[20]\nThe\r\ncourt a quo found the head of departmentâs decision in terms of s\r\n22(3) to have been validly taken. This decision was based\non the\r\nfactual issue whether urgency prevailed that allowed action in terms\r\nof s 22(3). The applicability of s 22(3) to the facts\nwas not\r\nconsidered. The appellants contend that s 22 is not applicable to the\r\nfacts, as the function of determining the language\npolicy of the\r\nschool is not allocated by the head of department in terms of s 21\r\nand cannot be withdrawn by him in terms of s 22.\n[21]\nLanguage\r\nis a sensitive issue. Great care is taken in the Act to establish a\r\ngoverning body that is representative of the community\nserved by a\r\nschool and to allocate to it the function of determining the language\r\npolicy. The Act authorises only the governing\nbody to determine the\r\nlanguage policy of an existing school and nobody else. As nobody else\r\nis empowered to exercise that function,\nit is inconceivable that s 22\r\nwas intended to give the head of department the power to withdraw\r\nthat function, albeit on reasonable\ngrounds, and appoint somebody\r\nelse to perform it, without saying so explicitly.\n[22\n]\tThe\r\nstructure of the Act sheds further light. As s 22 follows immediately\r\nafter s 21 and a distinction exists between the functions\nallocated\r\nin s 21 and elsewhere in the Act, it logically follows that s 22 is\r\ndesigned to deal with the withdrawal of functions\nallocated in terms\r\nof s 21. The logical default position if functions allocated in terms\r\nof s 21 are withdrawn is that they revert\nto the department of\r\neducation. This would explain why s 22, unlike s 25, does not provide\r\nfor the appointment of others to perform\nthe functions that are\r\nwithdrawn.\n[23]\nThe\r\nrespondents relied on the decision of this court in\nMinister\r\nof Education, Western Cape v Governing Body, Mikro Primary School\n12\nthat\r\nthe head of department could make use of s 22 to withdraw the\r\nfunction of determining the language policy. In that case a similar\n\nsituation to the present had arisen and the court a quo found that\r\nthe head of department had acted unlawfully when he imposed\na\r\ndirective that amended the Afrikaans language policy of the Mikro\r\nPrimary School and in that way purported to force that school\nto\r\nenrol learners who required tuition in a different language. It was\r\nargued on appeal that a finding that the directive was unlawful\nwould\r\nleave the head of department without a remedy if a governing body\r\nunreasonably refused to change its language policy. The\ncourt\r\nrejected this argument and expressed the opinion in an\nobiter\r\ndictum\nthat the head of department would inter alia have been entitled to\r\nmake use of the provisions of ss 22 and 25 of the Act.\n[24]\nThe\r\nconsiderations expressed above concerning the purpose of s 22 and the\r\ndistinction between the functions of a governing body\ncontained in ss\r\n20 and 21 were not considered in\nMikro\n.\n[25]\nThe\r\nerror in the interpretation of s 22 in\nMikro\nbecomes even more apparent when s 25 is considered. The head of\r\ndepartment purportedly appointed the interim committee in terms\nof s\r\n25(1) to perform the function of the governing body and change the\r\nlanguage policy of the school. Section 25 reads:\nâ\n(1) If the Head of\r\nDepartment determines on reasonable grounds that a governing body has\r\nceased to perform functions allocated to\nit in terms of this Act or\r\nhas failed to perform one or more of such functions, he or she must\r\nappoint sufficient persons to perform\nall such functions or one or\r\nmore of such functions, as the case may be, for a period not\r\nexceeding three months.\n(2) The Head of\r\nDepartment may extend the period referred to in subsection (1), by\r\nfurther periods not exceeding three months each,\nbut the total period\r\nmay not exceed one year.\n(3) If a governing body\r\nhas ceased to perform its functions, the Head of Department must\r\nensure that a governing body is elected\nin terms of this Act within a\r\nyear after the appointment of persons contemplated in subsection (1).\n(4) If a governing body\r\nfails to perform any of its functions, the persons contemplated in\r\nsubsection (1) must build the necessary\ncapacity within the period of\r\ntheir appointment to ensure that the governing body performs its\r\nfunctions.â\n[26]\nThe\r\nclear language of s 25(1) requires that before the head of department\r\ncould make use of the authority granted in the section,\nhe would have\r\nhad to have determined, on reasonable grounds, that the governing\r\nbody had ceased to perform its functions. In this\ncase the facts do\r\nnot support a reasonable conclusion that the governing body ceased to\r\ndetermine the language policy of the school.\nThe head of department\r\nwas dissatisfied with the result of the governing bodyâs\r\ndetermination but relied on the interpretation\nof s 25 in\nMikro\nto submit that the governing body ceased to perform that function\r\nwhen he withdrew it in terms of s 22. In\nMikro,\ns 25 was found applicable in similar circumstances on the basis of\r\nthe interpretation that â[i]f a function is withdrawn, the\n\ngoverning body ceases to perform that function, and s 25 becomes\r\napplicableâ.\n13\n[2\n7]\tThe\r\neffect of the interpretation in\nMikro\nis in my respectful view unacceptable because it enables the head of\r\ndepartment to create the state of affairs that would entitle\nhim or\r\nher to act in terms of s 25(1) whereas the language of s 25(1)\r\nrequires that state of affairs to have arisen as a prerequisite,\n\nreasonably established, before the head of department has the power\r\nto act in terms of s 25(1). The interpretation in\nMikro\nenables a functionary to abuse power and makes possible indirectly\r\nthat which cannot be attained directly.\n[28]\nThe\r\ngoverning body of the school did indeed perform the function of\r\ndetermining the language policy of the school. This is not the\nkind\r\nof function that is performed on a daily or weekly or even yearly\r\nbasis, but one that persists in its effect, once performed,\nuntil\r\nchanged or amended by the governing body. The governing body\r\nhistorically decided the language policy and the school continued\nto\r\nimplement it by admitting learners consistent with that policy.\n[29]\nThe\r\nrest of s 25 also illustrates why the interpretation in\nMikro\ndoes not stand scrutiny. Sufficient persons are to be appointed by\r\nthe head of department in terms of ss (1) to perform the function\nor\r\nfunctions that the governing body has ceased to perform and to do so\r\nfor a period not exceeding 3 months. The period of 3 months\ncan be\r\nextended by the head of department for further periods of 3 months,\r\nbut not for a total period of more than 1 year.\n14\nThose appointed are obliged to âbuild the necessary capacity within\r\nthe period of their appointment to ensure that the governing\nbody\r\nperforms its functionsâ.\n15\nThe head of department is also obliged to âensure that a governing\r\nbody is elected in terms of [the] Act within a year after\nthe\r\nappointment of persons contemplated in subsection (1)â.\n16\nThis shows that the aim of s 25 is to ensure that when a governing\r\nbody ceases to perform its functions, in the worst case scenario,\na\r\nfully functional governing body should be in place to continue\r\nperforming its functions within a maximum period of one year.\nThese\r\nprovisions are clearly inconsistent with an interpretation that a\r\nhead of department could simply take away the functions\nof a fully\r\noperational governing body and then proceed to comply with the rest\r\nof s 25. In addition, if ss 22 and 25 are utilised\ntogether, as in\r\nthis instance, the requirements of s 25 strip the consultation and\r\nreconsideration envisaged in ss 22(3), (4) and\n(5) of any meaning.\r\nCounsel for the head of department and the Minister was constrained\r\nto submit that once reinstated, the governing\nbody could change the\r\nlanguage policy back to what it was. The untenable situation that\r\nwould result underlines the fallacy of\nattempting to apply the two\r\nsections together.\n[30\n]\tFor\r\nthe abovementioned reasons I am of the view that the\nobiter\r\ndictum\nin\nMikro\non the interpretation of ss 22 and 25 is clearly wrong. The court a\r\nquo followed\nMikro\nand its decision is to be set aside for the same reasons.\n[31\n]\tThe\r\nwoes of the respondents do not end with the interpretation of the\r\nrelevant sections of the Act. The steps that were purportedly\ntaken\r\nin terms of the Act failed, in several respects, to comply with the\nPromotion of Administrative Justice Act.\n17\nThe head of department made the appointment of an interim committee\r\nin terms of\ns 25\nto determine the language policy of the school\r\nbefore he had withdrawn that power from the governing body; the\r\nconsequence of this\npremature purported appointment was that the\r\nlanguage policy was changed by the interim committee before the power\r\nof the governing\nbody to do so was withdrawn; far from allowing the\r\ninterim committee to reach their own decision the head of department,\r\nin the\nletter of appointment addressed to them, instructed them to\r\nâensure that the Language policy determined by [them] will enable\n\nthe learners to be admitted at Hoërskool Ermelo as a matter of\r\nurgencyâ and this was reinforced by a member of the department\nwho\r\nattended the meeting; it does not appear that the interim committee\r\nwas afforded the opportunity to consider all relevant and\navailable\r\ninformation before taking an âurgentâ, prescribed decision. In\r\nthe light of the conclusion that\nss 22\nand\n25\ndid not empower the\r\nhead of department to act as he did, it is not necessary to discuss\r\nthe detail of the contraventions of PAJA.\nIt suffices to say that\r\nthese contraventions were sufficient in themselves to have obliged\r\nthe court a quo to grant the relief\nsought by the appellants.\n[32\n]\tAs\r\nin\nMikro\nthe concern was expressed on behalf of the respondents that this\r\nconclusion leaves them without a remedy in similar circumstances.\nIt\r\ndoes not. PAJA prescribes the standard for all administrative action.\r\nThe respondents are entitled to review the language policy\ndetermined\r\nby a governing body of a school if they make out a case in terms of\r\nPAJA.\n[33]\nI\r\ntherefore conclude that the head of departmentâs withdrawal of the\r\ngoverning bodyâs function to determine the language policy\nof the\r\nschool was unlawful; that the head of departmentâs appointment of\r\nthe interim committee was unlawful; and that the decision\ntaken by\r\nthe unlawfully appointed interim committee was invalid.\n[34]\tIn the result\r\nthe following order is made:\n1.\nThe\r\nappeal is upheld.\n2.\nThe\r\norder of the court a quo is set aside and replaced by the following:\nâ\na\tThe first respondentâs decision\r\nto withdraw the function of the governing body of Hoërskool\r\nErmelo to determine the language\npolicy of the school is set aside.\nb\tThe first respondentâs decision to\r\nappoint an interim committee to perform the function of the governing\r\nbody to determine the\nlanguage policy of Hoërskool Ermelo is set\r\naside.\nc\tThe decision of the interim\r\ncommittee to amend the language policy of Hoërskool Ermelo from\r\nAfrikaans medium to parallel\nmedium is set aside.\nd\tLearners that have enrolled at\r\nHoërskool Ermelo since 25 January 2007 in terms of a parallel\r\nmedium language policy shall\nbe entitled to continue to be taught and\r\nwrite examinations in English until the completion of their school\r\ncareers.\ne\tThe costs of the application are to\r\nbe paid by the first and eighth respondents jointly and severally,\r\nthe one paying, the other\nto be absolved.â\n3.\nThe\r\ncosts of the appeal are to be paid by the first and eighth\r\nrespondents jointly and severally, the one paying, the other to be\n\nabsolved.\n_________________________\nS Snyders\nJudge of Appeal\nBRAND JA\n[35]\tI have had the\r\nadvantage of reading the judgment of my colleague Snyders JA. I agree\r\nwith both her reasoning and conclusions.\nBut I am sure it will not go\r\nunnoticed that I also agreed with the\nobiter\r\ndictum\nin\nMikro,\nwhich\r\nSnyders JA overrules in para 30 above. With the wisdom of hindsight I\r\nagree that, for the reasons given by her, the interpretation\nwe gave\r\nto sections 22 and 25 of the Act in\nMikro\ncannot be sustained. Perhaps this is a good illustration why\nobiter\r\ndicta\nshould\r\nbe resorted to sparingly for the very reason that they are not tested\r\nagainst the outcome of a real life dispute.\n[36]\tWithout the\r\nbenefit of a real life dispute, the rather cynical abuse to which the\nMikro\ninterpretation\r\ngave rise in this case could hardly have been anticipated. What the\r\nhead of the department did in this case was exactly\nwhat\nMikro\neventually\r\ndecided he has no right to do, namely to change the language policy\r\nof a school. The fact that he did so through the\nmedium of an interim\r\ncommittee which he used as a ventriloquist's dummy can hardly make\r\nany difference. To add insult to injury,\nhe purported to employ the\r\nurgent procedure in s 22(3), which meant that the language\r\npolicy of the school had already been\nchanged before the school\r\ngoverning body had had the opportunity to make the representations\r\ncontemplated by the section as to\nwhy their function should not be\r\nwithdrawn. In fact, as we know, it happened even before the governing\r\nbody was informed of the\ndecision to withdraw their function. Because\r\nof this cynical abuse, I was compelled to reconsider the\r\ninterpretation of sections\n22 and 25 which has led me to the\r\nconclusion that the\nMikro\ninterpretation\r\nwas wrong.\n______________________\nF D J BRAND\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor appellant:\nJ\r\nI Du Toit SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nJohan van der Wath Ingelyf, Pretoria\nSchoeman Maree Ingelyf, Bloemfontein\nFor respondent:\tB R Tokota SC\nD T Skosana\nInstructed by:\nThe State Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\nThe\r\n\turgent interim application that was granted and later set aside is\r\n\tnot relevant to the appeal.\n2\n2002 (4) SA 877\n(T).\n3\nAccording to the\r\n\tminutes of the meeting it terminated at 13:45.\n4\nSection 29(2) of\r\n\tthe Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n5\nMinister of\r\n\tEducation, Western Cape v Governing Body, Mikro Primary School\n2006 (1) SA 1\n(SCA) para 31.\n6\nS 16(1).\n7\nThe full text of s\r\n\t6 reads: â(1) Subject to the Constitution and this Act, the\r\n\tMinister may, by notice in the\nGovernment\r\n\tGazette\n,\r\n\tafter consultation with the Council of Education Ministers,\r\n\tdetermine norms and standards for language policy in public schools.\n(2)\r\n\tThe governing body of a public school may determine the language\r\n\tpolicy of the school subject to the Constitution, this Act\nand any\r\n\tapplicable provincial law.\n(3)\r\n\tNo form of racial discrimination may be practised in implementing\r\n\tpolicy determined under this section.\n(4)\r\n\tA recognised Sign Language has the status of an official language\r\n\tfor purposes of learning at a public school.â\n8\nSuch norms and\r\n\tstandards were published in Government Gazette 18546 on 19 December\r\n\t1997, but do not play a role in this case.\n9\nSection 23: (1)\r\n\tSubject to this Act, the membership of the governing body of an\r\n\tordinary public school comprises â (a) elected\nmembers;

    "facts": "Hoërskool Ermelo, a public school, had an Afrikaans‑medium language policy determined by its governing body. From 2001 the Mpumalanga Department of Education repeatedly interfered, at one point disbanding the governing body and appointing an acting principal. In 2007 the department sought to admit a number of Grade‑8 learners who required English tuition. The head of department instructed the school to admit them, contrary to the existing language policy. On 25 January 2007 the head of department, invoking sections 22 and 25 of the Schools Act, withdrew the governing body’s function to determine the language policy, appointed an interim committee, and directed it to change the policy to a parallel‑medium (English and Afrikaans) arrangement. The interim committee adopted the new policy without proper consultation. The school and its governing body sought judicial review of the head of department’s actions.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the head of department could lawfully withdraw the governing body’s function to determine the school’s language policy under section 22 of the Schools Act. 2. Whether the head of department could then appoint an interim committee to perform that function under section 25. 3. Whether the procedures required by the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA) were complied with. 4. Whether the amendment of the language policy by the interim committee was valid.",
    "principles": "The Schools Act vests the exclusive power to determine a school’s language policy in the governing body (section 6 and 20). Section 22 permits withdrawal of a governing body’s function only for functions that the head of department may allocate under section 21; it does not extend to the language‑policy function, which is not an allocated function. Section 25 allows the head of department to appoint persons to perform functions only when the governing body has *ceased* to perform those functions, after a reasonable determination. PAJA requires that any administrative action be lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair, including giving reasons, hearing representations and considering them.",
    "application": "The court examined the statutory scheme and concluded that the language‑policy function is not one that can be withdrawn under section 22 because it is not a function allocated under section 21. Consequently, the pre‑condition for invoking section 25 – that the governing body had ceased to perform the function – was not satisfied. The head of department’s appointment of an interim committee therefore lacked statutory authority and breached the procedural requirements of PAJA, as the committee was appointed before any withdrawal and without proper notice or opportunity to be heard. The decision of the interim committee to change the language policy was therefore invalid.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The decisions of the head of department to withdraw the governing body’s function, to appoint the interim committee, and the interim committee’s amendment of the language policy were all set aside. Learners enrolled under the parallel‑medium policy since 25 January 2007 were ordered to continue receiving instruction and sitting examinations in English until the end of their school careers. The costs of the application were awarded against the first and eighth respondents (Head of Department and Minister of Education) jointly and severally."
