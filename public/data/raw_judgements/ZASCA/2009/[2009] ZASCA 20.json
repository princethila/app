This\r\nquestion is one of two\nmain issues to be decided in this case. The\r\nother one is whether the City and Johannesburg Water (unless the\r\ncontext indicates\notherwise, henceforth jointly referred to as the\r\nCity) could restrict access to water by the Phiri residents by way of\r\nprepayment\nwater meters.\n[2]\tUpon application by the five\r\nrespondents, all of whom are resident in Phiri, the Johannesburg High\r\nCourt (per Tsoka J) made\nan order in terms of which it:\n(a)\tReviewed and set aside the\r\ndecision of the City alternatively Johannesburg Water to limit free\r\nbasic water supply to 25 litres\nper person per day or 6 kilolitres\r\nper household per month.\n(b)\tDeclared the prepayment water\r\nsystem used in Phiri Township, the âforced installationâ of  the\r\nsystem and the choice given\nby the City alternatively Johannesburg\r\nWater to the respondents and other residents of Phiri of either a\r\nprepayment water supply\nor a water supply through standpipes,\r\nunconstitutional and unlawful.\n(c)\tOrdered the City\r\nalternatively Johannesburg Water to provide each applicant âand\r\nother similarly placed residents of Phiri\nTownshipâ with a free\r\nbasic water supply of 50 liters per person per day and the option of\r\na metered supply installed at the\ncost of the City.\nWith the leave of the court a quo\r\nthe City and Johannesburg Water together with the third appellant,\r\nthe Minister of Water Affairs\nand Forestry, now appeal to this court.\n[3]\tThe City is a municipality in\r\nthe Province of Gauteng. In terms of the Constitution one of the\r\nobjects of local government is\nto ensure the provision of services to\r\ncommunities in a sustainable manner (s 152(1)(b)). Like the\r\nother objects of local\ngovernment a municipality must strive, within\r\nits financial and administrative capacity, to achieve that object\r\n(s 152(2)).\nIt has executive authority in respect of, and has\r\nthe right to administer, among others, water and sanitation services\r\n(s 156(1))\nand may make bylaws for the effective administration\r\nof these services (s 156(2)).\n[4]\tThe residents of Phiri are\r\nvery poor, but, for years, until 2004, they, like residents in the\r\nrest of Soweto, Alexandra and\nother townships within the area of\r\njurisdiction of the City, had access to an unlimited supply of water\r\nwhich was not metered and\nfor which they were charged on the basis of\r\na deemed consumption of 20kl per month. In 2004 the deemed\r\nconsumption was discontinued\nby the City and prepayment meters were\r\ninstalled dispensing 6kl water per stand per month free. Additional\r\nwater had to be pre-paid\nfor. The respondents contended that 6kl\r\nwater per stand per month was insufficient water for the residents of\r\nPhiri and that in\nterms of s 27 of the Constitution, they had a\r\nright of access to sufficient water, which they contended would be 50\r\nlitres\nwater per person per day. That quantity of water, so they\r\ncontended, had to be provided free to each resident in Phiri who\r\ncould\nnot afford to pay for such water.\n[5]\tSection 27 of the\r\nConstitution provides that everyone has the right to have access to\r\nsufficient water. The section reads as\nfollows:\nâ\n(1)\tEveryone has\r\nthe right to have access to â\n(a)\thealth care\r\nservices, including reproductive health care;\n(b)\tsufficient food\r\nand water; and\n(c)\tsocial security,\r\nincluding, if they are unable to support themselves and their\r\ndependents, appropriate social assistance.\n(2)\tThe state must\r\ntake reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available\r\nresources, to achieve the progressive realisation\nof each of these\r\nrights.â\n[6]\tGiving effect to its\r\nobligation in terms of s 27(2) the state enacted the\nWater\nServices Act 108 of 1997\n.\nSection 4\nof the Act provides that water\r\nservices must be provided in terms of conditions set by the water\r\nservices provider which must accord\nwith conditions for the provision\r\nof water services contained in bylaws made by the water services\r\nauthority having jurisdiction\nin the area in question. The City is a\r\nwater services authority and Johannesburg Water is a water services\r\nprovider as defined\nin the Act.\n[7]\tIn the preamble to the Act\r\nâthe rights of access to basic water supply and basic sanitation\r\nnecessary to ensure sufficient\nwater and an environment not harmful\r\nto health or well-beingâ are recognised.\nSection 3\nprovides as\r\nfollows:\nâ\n(1)\tEveryone has\r\na right of access to basic water supply and basic sanitation.\n(2)\tEvery water\r\nservices institution must take reasonable measures to realise these\r\nrights.\n(3)\tEvery water\r\nservices authority must, in its water services development plan,\r\nprovide for measures to realise these rights.\n(4)\tThe rights\r\nmentioned in this section are subject to the limitations contained in\r\nthis Act.â\n[8]\tââBasic water supplyâ\r\nmeans the prescribed minimum standard of water supply services\r\nnecessary for the reliable supply\nof a sufficient quantity and\r\nquality of water to households, including informal households, to\r\nsupport life and personal hygieneâ\n(s 1).\nIt follows that in\r\nterms of\ns 3(1)\neveryone has a right of access to âthe\r\nprescribed minimum standard of water supply services necessary for\r\nthe reliable supply\nof a sufficient quantity of water to households .\r\n. . to support life and personal hygiene.â\n[9]\tAs envisaged in\ns 3\nread\r\nwith the definition of âbasic water supplyâ water services\r\nregulations providing for the minimum standard of water supply\n\nservices were promulgated.\nRegulation 3\nprovides:\nâ\n3\tThe minimum\r\nstandard for basic water supply services is â\n(a)\t. . .\n(b)\ta minimum\r\nquantity of potable water of 25 litres per person per day or 6\r\nkilolitres per household per month â\n(i)\tat a minimum\r\nflow rate of  not less than 10 litres per minute;\n(ii)\twithin 200\r\nmetres of a household; and\n(iii)\twith an\r\neffectiveness such that no consumer is without a supply for more than\r\nseven full days in any year.â\n[10]\nSection 3\nof the Act read\r\nwith\nregulation 3(b)\ntherefore provides that everyone has a right of\r\naccess to a minimum quantity of water of 25 litres per person per day\r\nor 6 kilolitres\nper household per month. The appellants submitted\r\nthat as a result of this legislation the respondents could no longer\r\nbase their\nclaim on a right of access to sufficient water in terms of\r\ns 27 of the Constitution but had to base their claim on the\r\nprovisions\nof the Act. They submitted that where national legislation\r\nhad been enacted to give effect to a constitutional right, it was\r\nimpermissible\nfor a litigant to rely directly on the constitutional\r\nright concerned. In this regard they relied on\nMEC\r\nfor Education, KwaZulu-Natal, and Others v Pillay\n[2007] ZACC 21\n;\n2008 (1) SA 474\n(CC) at para 40 where Langa CJ said:\nâ\nThis court has\r\nheld in the context of both administrative and labour law that a\r\nlitigant cannot circumvent legislation enacted to\ngive effect to a\r\nconstitutional right by attempting to rely directly on the\r\nconstitutional right. To do so would be to âfail\nto recognise the\r\nimportant task conferred upon the legislature by the Constitution to\r\nrespect, protect, promote and fulfil the\nrights in the Bill of\r\nRightsâ. The same principle applies to the Equality Act. Absent a\r\ndirect challenge to the Act, courts must\nassume that the Equality Act\r\nis consistent with the Constitution and claims must be decided within\r\nits margins.â\n[11]\tThe respondents conceded\r\nthat this rule, (âthe direct reliance ruleâ), is well\r\nestablished. But, they submitted that the\nrule does not operate\r\nwhenever legislation gives effect to a constitutional right. It\r\noperates only if and when, on a proper interpretation\nof the\r\nlegislation read with the constitutional right to which it gives\r\neffect, the legislation is intended to be exhaustive of\nthe right,\r\nthat is, if parliament intended to cover the field. In support of\r\nthis submission they relied on Chaskalson CJâs reasoning\nin\nMinister of Health and\r\nAnother v New Clicks South Africa (Pty) Ltd\n2006 (2) SA 311\n(CC) in which he held that a review of administrative\r\naction can no longer be brought directly under s 33 (1) of the\r\nConstitution\nand has to be brought under the\nPromotion of\nAdministrative Justice Act 3 of 2000\n. Chaskalson CJ said:\nâ\nPAJA is the\r\nnational legislation that was passed to give effect to the rights\r\ncontained in\ns 33.\nIt was clearly intended to be, and in\r\nsubstance is, a codification of these rights. It was required to\r\ncover the field and purports\nto do so.\nA litigant cannot\r\navoid the provisions of PAJA by going behind it, and seeking to rely\r\non s 33(1) of the Constitution or the\ncommon law. That would\r\ndefeat the purpose of the Constitution in requiring the rights\r\ncontained in s 33 to be given effect\nto by means of national\r\nlegislation.â\n1\n[12]\tHowever, there is a\r\nsubstantial difference between, on the one hand, the constitutional\r\nprovisions and legislation that gave\nrise to the application of the\r\ndirect reliance rule and, on the other hand, s 27 of the\r\nConstitution and the\nWater Services Act.\n(i\n)\tSection 9(4) of the\r\nConstitution provides that no person may unfairly discriminate\r\nagainst anyone on one or more of the grounds\nmentioned and then adds\r\nthat national legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit\r\nunfair discrimination. The Equality Act\nwas thereupon enacted to give\r\neffect to s 9. That is the background to the Constitutional\r\nCourtâs decision in\nPillay\nreferred to above.\n(ii)\tSection 33(1) of the\r\nConstitution provides that everyone has the right to administrative\r\naction that is lawful, reasonable\nand procedurally fair and\r\nsubsection (3) requires national legislation to be enacted to give\r\neffect to that right. PAJA was thereupon\nenacted to give effect to\r\nthat right. It is on that basis that Chaskalson CJ applied the direct\r\nreliance rule in\nNew\r\nClicks\n.\n(iii)\tSection 23(5) of the\r\nConstitution provides that every trade union, employersâ\r\norganisation and employer has the right to\nengage in collective\r\nbargaining and that national legislation may be enacted to regulate\r\ncollective bargaining. Regulations in\nterms of the Defence Act 44 of\r\n1957, which in terms of the Constitution qualify as national\r\nlegislation, were promulgated to regulate\ncollective bargaining. This\r\nled OâRegan J in giving the judgment of the Constitutional Court in\nSouth African National\r\nDefence Union v Minister of Defence and Others\n2007 (5) SA 400\n(CC) to say in para 52 that âa litigant who seeks\r\nto assert his or her right to engage in collective bargaining under\r\ns 23(5)\nshould in the first place base his or her case on any\r\nlegislation enacted to regulate the right, not on s 23(5).\n[13]\tIn all these cases the\r\ndirect reliance rule was applied in circumstances where the\r\nConstitution provided that legislation could\nbe or had to be enacted\r\nto give effect to the right in terms of the Constitution and where\r\nthat had been done. In the present case\nthe Constitution does not\r\nprovide that legislation could or had to be enacted to give effect to\r\nthe right of access to sufficient\nwater. It provides that legislative\r\nand other measures must be taken to achieve the progressive\r\nrealisation of each of the rights\nmentioned in s 27(1). It was\r\nin my view realised that there were people who had access to\r\nsufficient water and others who\ndid not have such access and could\r\nnot immediately be given such access. It is for the latter category\r\nof people that the Constitution\nrequires the state to take reasonable\r\nlegislative and other measures, within its available resources, to\r\nachieve the progressive\nrealisation of the right of access to\r\nsufficient water. Section 27(2) was therefore not intended to cover\r\nthe field and to deprive\nanyone of its right to rely on the\r\nprovisions of s 27(1). On the contrary it simply recognises that\r\nit may, in certain circumstances,\nnot be possible for the state to\r\ngive immediate effect to the provisions of s 27(1) and requires\r\nthe state to take reasonable\nlegislative and other measures to\r\nencourage the progressive realisation of the right of access to\r\nsufficient water.\n[14]\tThe\nWater Services Act\ntogether\nwith the regulations promulgated in terms thereof, provide\r\nthat 6kl water per household per month or 25 litres per person per\r\nday,\nis the minimum quantity of water that would constitute a\r\nsufficient quantity of water for households to support life and\r\npersonal\nhygiene. In terms of\ns 3\nand subject to the limitations\r\ncontained in the Act (s 3(4)) everyone has a right of access to\r\nthat quantity of water (s 3(1)),\nevery water services\r\ninstitution must take reasonable measures to realise these rights\r\n(s 3(2)) and every water services authority\nmust, in its water\r\nservices development plan, provide for measures to realise these\r\nrights (s 3(3)). These provisions were\nnot intended to detract\r\nfrom the right of everyone of access to sufficient water in terms of\r\ns 27(1) of the Constitution.\nThey were intended, as required by\r\ns 27(2), to achieve a progressive realisation of those rights.\r\nAs a result of these provisions\nit cannot be contended by a water\r\nservices institution that a lesser quantity of water would constitute\r\nsufficient water to support\nlife and personal hygiene. The quantity\r\nstipulated is the minimum that may constitute sufficient water.\r\nHowever, circumstances\ndiffer, some people, like the residents of\r\nPhiri, may have waterborne sanitation while others have pit latrines\r\nwhich makes a dramatic\ndifference to the water required. By\r\nstipulating the minimum that would constitute sufficient water the\r\nlegislature has not stipulated\nthat that quantity would in all\r\ncircumstances constitute sufficient water.\n[15]\tIt follows that the\nWater\nServices Act does\nnot deprive anyone of the right of access to\r\nsufficient water in terms of\ns 27(1).\nThis interpretation gives\r\nrise to three questions, namely: (i) What would constitute sufficient\r\nwater in terms of\ns 27(1)\n; (ii) Does the City have to provide\r\nresidents of Phiri with access to that quantity of water; and (iii)\r\nDoes the City have to provide\nsuch access or access to a lesser\r\nquantity of water free. I shall deal with each of these questions in\r\nturn.\nWhat would constitute\r\nsufficient water in terms of\ns 27(1)?\n[16]\tIn interpreting the right to\r\nsufficient water a purposive approach should be followed. In\r\ndetermining the purpose of the right\none should have regard to the\r\nhistory and background to the adoption of the Constitution and the\r\nother provisions of the Constitution,\nin particular the other rights\r\nwith which it is associated in the Bill of Rights.\n2\nOn this approach the following passage in\nSoobramoney\nis apposite:\n3\nâ\nThere is a high\r\nlevel of unemployment, inadequate social security, and many do not\r\nhave access to clean water or to adequate health\nservices. These\r\nconditions already existed when the Constitution was adopted and a\r\ncommitment to address them, and to transform\nour society into one in\r\nwhich there will be human dignity, freedom and equality, lies at the\r\nheart of our new constitutional order.\nFor as long as these\r\nconditions continue to exist that aspiration will have a hollow\r\nring.â\n[17]\tA commitment to address a\r\nlack of access to clean water and to transform our society into one\r\nin which there will be human\ndignity and equality, lying at the heart\r\nof our Constitution, it follows that a right of access to sufficient\r\nwater cannot be anything\nless than a right of access to that quantity\r\nof water that is required for dignified human existence. Support for\r\nthis conclusion\nis to be found in the 2002 General Comment 15 of the\r\nUnited Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on\r\nthe International\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,\r\nin which it is stated: âThe human right to water is indispensable\r\nfor leading\na life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the\r\nrealization of other human rights.â\n4\nAnd âThe right to water clearly falls within the category of\r\nguarantees essential for securing an adequate standard of living,\n\nparticularly since it is one of the most fundamental conditions for\r\nsurvival. . . . The right should also be seen in conjunction\nwith\r\nother rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights,\r\nforemost amongst them the right to life and human dignity.â\n5\nFor this reason âthe elements of the right to water must be\nadequate\nfor human dignity, life and healthâ.\n6\n[18]\tThe quantity of water that\r\nis required for dignified human existence would depend on the\r\ncircumstances of the individual concerned.\nAs stated above the\nWater\nServices Act, read\nwith the regulations promulgated in terms thereof,\r\nprescribes a basic minimum supply of water of 6kl per household per\r\nmonth or\n25 litres per person per day. Being a basic minimum supply\r\nof water and bearing in mind that many people who are in desperate\r\nneed\nof adequate access to water, do not have waterborne sanitation;\r\nthe basic minimum supply of water in terms of the Act must have\nbeen\r\ndetermined by reference to the needs of households or individuals who\r\ncan manage without waterborne sanitation. That is so\nbecause\r\naccording to the evidence a flush toilet dispenses approximately 10\r\nlitres of water per flush and nobody has suggested,\nor could on the\r\nevidence suggest, that 6kl per household per month or 25 litres per\r\nperson per day constituted sufficient water\nfor leading a life in\r\nhuman dignity where use had to be made of flush toilets, as is the\r\ncase in Phiri.\n[19]\tConfirmation of the\r\naforegoing is to be found in the White Paper issued by the Department\r\nof Water Affairs and Forestry in\nNovember 1994 entitled âWater\r\nSupply and Sanitation Policyâ. In respect of water supply it is\r\nsaid: âBasic water supply is\ndefined as 25 litres per person per\r\nday. This is considered to be the minimum required for direct\r\nconsumption, for the preparation\nof food and for personal hygiene. It\r\nis not considered to be adequate for a full, healthy and productive\r\nlife which is why it is\nconsidered as a minimum.â\n[20]\tIn September 2003 the\r\nDepartment issued a Strategic Framework for Water Services entitled\r\nâWater is Life, Sanitation is Dignityâ.\nAccording to the\r\nFramework, basic levels of service would be âreviewed in future to\r\nconsider increasing the basic level from\n25 to 50 litres per personâ.\n[21]\tAs to what quantity of water\r\nwould constitute sufficient water for the residents of Phiri the\r\nrespondents relied on and the\ncourt below accepted the evidence of P\r\nH Gleick the author of an article entitled âBasic water\r\nrequirements for human activities:\nMeeting basic needsâ published\r\nin Water International, 21 (1996) 83-92. According to the article the\r\nwater requirements of a\nresident of Phiri per day are a minimum of\r\n(i) three litres by way of fluid replacement under average temperate\r\nclimate conditions\nand 5 litres in tropical and subtropical\r\nconditions; (ii) 5 to 15 litres for adequate bathing; (iii) 10 litres\r\nfor food preparation,\nincluding dishwashing; and (iv) 20 litres for\r\nwaterborne sanitation. On this basis he recommended in the article\r\nthat a minimum\nof 50 litres per person per day be provided taking the\r\nupper limit for drinking water and bathing. No reason for taking the\r\nupper\nlimit in respect of bathing is advanced. In an affidavit filed\r\nin support of the respondentsâ claim Gleick stated that 50 litres\n\nper person, made up in the same way, should be viewed as a minimum\r\nbasic need. The 15 litres per day for bathing he justified on\nthe\r\nbasis that Phiri residents cannot rely on rivers for bathing.\r\nHowever, the statement in the article that 5 to 15 litres would\nbe\r\nadequate for bathing is not qualified in this manner. In the result,\r\nreducing the 50 litres minimum by 2 litres in respect of\ndrinking\r\nwater Gleickâs evidence, at best for the respondents, is to the\r\neffect that a Phiri resident, who is not  living in\ntropical or\r\nsubtropical conditions, requires a minimum of 48 litres per day.\n[22]\tThe appellants relied on an\r\naffidavit by I H Palmer in respect of the water requirements of the\r\nresidents of Phiri. Palmer\nis a civil engineer and managing director\r\nof Palmer Development Group (Pty) Ltd a consultancy company offering\r\nconsultancy services\nin respect of, among others, water supply and\r\nsanitation. According to him 3 litres drinking water per person per\r\nday is considered\nreasonable for a Highveld climate, 7 litres per\r\nperson per day is consistently used in the literature as a minimum\r\nfor personal\nwashing but 14 litres per day is consistent with\r\nresearch carried out for a low income water use category, 9.2 litres\r\nper person\nis required by a household of four in respect of cooking,\r\nwashing of dishes, washing of clothes and cleaning of the premises\r\nand\n15 litres (1.5 toilet flushes) in respect of toilet flushing ie,\r\ntaking the upper limit in respect of personal washing which is\nalmost\r\nthe same as the figure suggested by Gleick, a total of 41.2 litres\r\nper person per day is required.\n[23]\tThe appellants objected to\r\nthe court a quoâs reliance on the evidence of Gleick on the basis,\r\namongst others, that in terms\nof the\nPlascon\r\nEvans\nrule, the matter\r\nhaving been brought on application, it should be decided on the\r\nappellantsâ (respondents in the court below)\nevidence in so far as\r\nit differs from that of Gleick. The respondents on the other hand\r\nsubmitted that Palmerâs evidence could\nnot be accepted because he\r\napplied the wrong standard. According to the submission Palmerâs\r\nstandard was the quantity of water\nrequired for the public benefit\r\nand not the quantity of water required for dignified human existence.\r\nI do not think that this\ncriticism of Palmerâs evidence is\r\njustified. It is clear from his evidence that he realised that what\r\nhe had to determine was\nthe quantity of water required for dignified\r\nhuman existence and that that was what he attempted to do. His\r\nquantification is specifically\ndone under the heading âQuantifying\r\nthe amount of water needed for health (and human dignity).\n[24]\tThe only real difference\r\nbetween the evidence of Gleick and Palmer is that Palmer is of the\r\nopinion that 15 litres of water\nwould suffice for waterborne\r\nsanitation whereas Gleick is of the opinion that 20 litres are\r\nrequired. There is no basis upon which\nthe evidence of Gleick can on\r\nthe papers be preferred to that of Palmer. The same applies to the\r\nminor differences in respect of\npersonal washing and cooking and\r\nhouse cleaning. For these reasons I am of the view, on the evidence\r\npresented, that 42 litres\nwater per person per day would constitute\r\nsufficient water in terms of s 27(1) of the Constitution.\nDoes the City have to provide\r\nPhiri residents with 42 litres of water per person per day?\n[25]\tIn terms of\ns 11\nof the\nWater Services Act every\nwater services authority has a duty to all\r\nconsumers in its area of jurisdiction to progressively ensure\r\nefficient, affordable,\neconomical and sustainable access to water\r\nservices\n(s 11(1)).\nThis duty is subject to, amongst others, the\r\navailability of resources; the need for an equitable allocation of\r\nresources to all\nconsumers; the need to regulate access to water\r\nservices in an equitable way; the duty of consumers to pay reasonable\r\ncharges;\nand the right to limit or discontinue the provision of water\r\nservices if there is a failure to comply with reasonable conditions\n\nset for the provision of such services\n(s 11(2)).\nIn ensuring\r\naccess to water services, a water services authority must take into\r\naccount factors such as the need for regional efficiency;\nthe need to\r\nachieve benefit of scale; and the  requirements of equity\n(s 11(3)).\nIt may not unreasonably refuse or fail to give access to water\r\nservices to a consumer or potential consumer in its area of\r\njurisdiction\n(s 11(4)).\n[26]\tAlthough\ns 27(1)\nprovides that everyone has the right to sufficient water everyone\r\ndoes not have a claim for the immediate fulfilment of that right.\nAs\r\nwas said by Chaskalson CJ in\nSoobramoney\r\nv Minister of Health (KwaZulu-Natal)\n[1997] ZACC 17\n;\n1998\r\n(1) SA 765\n(CC) para 11:\nâ\nWhat is apparent\r\nfrom these provisions is that the obligations imposed on the state by\nsections 26\nand\n27\nin regard to access to housing, health care, food,\r\nwater and social security are dependent upon the resources available\r\nfor such\npurposes, and that the corresponding rights themselves are\r\nlimited by reason of the lack of resources.  Given this lack of\n\nresources and the significant demands on them that have already been\r\nreferred to, an unqualified obligation to meet these needs\nwould not\r\npresently be capable of being fulfilled.â\n[27]\tA local authority such as\r\nthe City is required only to act reasonably and to progressively\r\nfulfil its obligation to ensure\nthat everyone has access to\r\nsufficient water.\n7\nIt is, however, not the Cityâs case that it is unable to provide\r\nthe residents of Phiri with sufficient water and that it is\nnot\r\nobliged to provide them with access to sufficient water, be it 42\r\nlitres or a greater quantity. The Cityâs case is that it\ndoes not\r\nhave to provide free water. Subject to the residents paying for such\r\nwater they are not restricted to a certain quantity\nof water.\nDoes the City have to provide\r\nsuch access or access to a lesser quantity of water free of charge?\n[28]\tIn terms of\ns 27(1)\neveryone has the right to have access to sufficient water ie every\r\nPhiri resident has the right to have access to 42 litres per\nday. But\r\nmany of the Phiri residents are poor and at least some of them cannot\r\nafford to pay for the water they need. Not being\nable to pay for the\r\nwater, they have no access to that water. Compare in this regard 2002\r\nGeneral Comment 15 of the United Nations\nCommittee on Economic,\r\nSocial and Cultural Rights on the International Covenant on Economic,\r\nSocial and Cultural Rights\n8\nin which it is said, under the heading âAccessibilityâ, that\r\nwater, and water facilities and services, must be affordable for\nall\r\nand must be accessible to all including the most vulnerable or\r\nmarginalized sections of the population, in law and in fact.\n[29]\tThe City did not contend\r\nthat a person who cannot afford to pay for water has access to that\r\nwater. It contended, as stated\nabove, that the respondents could not\r\nrely on the Constitution but had to rely on the\nWater Services Act.\nIn\nterms thereof, so it submitted, the City was obliged to take\r\nreasonable measures to secure access to basic water services as\r\nprescribed\nin the Water Regulations and not to provide such basic\r\nservices free. I have already rejected the submission that the\r\nrespondents\ncould not base their claim on s 27(1) of the\r\nConstitution and I do not agree that, in terms of the Act, no water\r\nis to be\nprovided free. Section 4(3)(c) of the Act expressly provides\r\nthat âprocedures for the limitation or discontinuation of water\r\nservices must not result in a person being denied access to basic\r\nwater services for non-payment, where that person proves, to the\n\nsatisfaction of the relevant water services authority, that he or she\r\nis unable to pay for basic servicesâ. It is also not the\npolicy of\r\nthe Department of Water Affairs and Forestry or of the City not to\r\nprovide free water in any circumstances.\n[30]\tA contention that the state\r\nand the City are not obliged to provide water free to people who\r\ncannot afford to pay for that\nwater in circumstances where it would\r\nbe reasonable to expect the state or the City to do so is in my view\r\nuntenable. Whether it\nwould be reasonable will of course depend on\r\nits available resources and other relevant considerations. The state\r\nand the City\nrealised that to be so. That much is clear from the free\r\nwater policy adopted by the state and the City to which I now turn.\n[31]\tIn February 2001 the\r\nMinister of Water Affairs and Forestry announced that government had\r\nresolved to ensure that poor households\nwere given a basic supply of\r\nwater free of charge. He went on to state that Cabinet had approved a\r\npolicy to provide 6kl of safe\nwater per household per month. In May\r\n2001 the Chief Directorate: Water Services of the Department of Water\r\nAffairs and Forestry\nissued Version 1 of its âFree Basic Waterâ\r\nImplementation Strategy Document in which it is said:\nâ\nAgain it needs to\r\nbe recognised that local authorities should still have some\r\ndiscretion over this amount. In some areas they may\nchoose to provide\r\na greater amount, while in other areas only a smaller amount may be\r\npossible. For example, in some remote areas\nwith scattered\r\nsettlements, high water costs and water stressed areas it is often\r\nnot feasible to provide 6000 litres of water.\n. . . In some areas\r\nwhere poor households have waterborne sanitation the total amount of\r\nwater seen as a âbasic supplyâ may\nneed to be adjusted upwards\r\n(if financially feasible) to take into account water used for\r\nflushing.â\n[32]\t Shortly after the\r\npromulgation of the water regulations on 28 June 2001 the City\r\napproved Johannesburg Waterâs business\nplan in terms of which it\r\nwas recommended that each household be provided with 6kl free water\r\nper month. The provision of 6kl free\nwater per month may have been\r\nbrought about by the regulations read with\ns 4(3)(c)\nof the\nWater Services Act which\nprovide, as stated above, that procedures\r\nfor the limitation or discontinuation of water services must not\r\nresult in a person being\ndenied access to basic water services for\r\nnon-payment, where that person proves, to the satisfaction of the\r\nrelevant water services\nauthority, that he or she is unable to pay\r\nfor basic water services. Initially the decision to provide 6kl free\r\nwater per month\nwas only implemented in areas other than deemed\r\nconsumption areas such as Soweto. Later, when prepayment water meters\r\nhad been\ninstalled in Phiri the first 6kl per month per stand was\r\nalso provided free but for all water required in excess of 6kl\r\nprepayment\nhad to be made.\n[33]\tThe City from time to time\r\nrevised its free water policy. In mid-2005 it appointed consultants\r\nto undertake, amongst others,\nthe development of a clear set of\r\npolicy recommendations for how to restructure the Cityâs social\r\npackage designed to assist\nthe poor, the assessment of past\r\nexperience of the City in implementing successive versions of the\r\nsocial package and the evaluation\nof a variety of options for\r\ntargeting the social package so that it optimally benefits poor\r\nhouseholds. The work culminated in\ntwo documents one of which is\r\ntitled âA Social Package Policy Base Documentâ dated 8 June 2006\r\n(âthe Base Documentâ). The\nBase Document recommends that 10kl\r\nfree water per month per consumer unit be provided to properties\r\nvalued at less than a certain\namount and that no free water be\r\nprovided to other properties. It adds:\nâ\n6kl of water per\r\nmonth is the standard for free basic water per month. The amount of\r\n6kl is based on the RDP standard of 25l per\nday, and a household size\r\nof 8 people. This amount is adequate for households with no\r\nreticulation . . ..\nEvidence suggests\r\nthat the average consumer unit size in the poorer areas of\r\nJohannesburg is 7 to 8 people . . .. A consumer unit\nof 7 people\r\nusing 50l of water per day will use 10.5kl of water per month.\nIt is recommended\r\nthat the free basic water allocation to poor households be increased\r\nto 10kl a month. This will go a long way\nto ensuring that larger\r\nhouseholds in Johannesburg have access to adequate water.â\n[34]\tThe recommendations\r\ncontained in the Base Document have not been adopted by the City. At\r\nthe time when the answering affidavits\nwere deposed to, namely\r\nJanuary 2007, it was envisaged that a new social package policy would\r\nbe implemented effective July 2008\nbut that has not happened. The\r\nMayoral Committee of the City however decided, as an interim measure:\n(i)\tThat the free basic water\r\nallocation to targeted poor households be increased from 6kl to 10kl\r\nso as to ensure that up to 13\npeople on a stand would receive at\r\nleast 25 litres of water per day.\n(ii)\tThat the Cityâs existing\r\nRegister of Indigents be used as a basis for targeting poor\r\nhouseholds ie that 10kl of free water\nbe provided to accountholders\r\non the Register of Indigents.\n(Section 23\nof the Credit Control and\r\nDebt Collection By-Laws of the City makes provision for registration\r\nupon application of a person as\nan indigent person. As at January\r\n2007 there were 118 549 accountholders registered on the\r\nregister.)\n(iii)\tThat an additional 4kl free\r\nwater per annum be allowed to every accountholder with a prepayment\r\nmeter to cover any emergency\nrequiring additional water.\n(iv)\tThat representations be\r\nconsidered for additional water in the case of people whose\r\ncircumstances warrant an additional allocation\nof water.\n[35]\tAt the time it was envisaged\r\nthat the interim measures would be introduced as from March 2007.\r\nThat did not happen but according\nto the appellants they were fully\r\nintroduced by the time that the application for leave to appeal was\r\nheard. The respondents dispute\nthat a representation mechanism has\r\nbeen established but in the light of the conclusion to which I have\r\narrived there is no need\nto deal with this dispute.\n[36]\tThe City maintains that it\r\nhas no constitutional obligation to provide more than 25 litres free\r\nwater per person per day and\nconcedes that what it is trying to\r\nachieve by way of the interim measures is to get 25 litres per day to\r\neveryone who cannot afford\nto pay for water. That is with the\r\nexception of special cases such as where a person is suffering from\r\nAIDS, where a greater quantity\nof water may be provided. The City\r\nconcedes that the method adopted to target those that cannot afford\r\nto pay for water is not\nperfect but contends that it is a practical\r\napproach and that the cost of a more targeted solution would be\r\nprohibitive.\n[37]\t Apart from submitting that\r\nthe respondents had no right of access to more water than the basic\r\nwater supply in terms of the\nWater Services Act read\nwith the water\r\nregulations ie 6 kl per household or 25 litres per person, the City,\r\nquite correctly, submitted that its obligation\nextended only to its\r\ncapacity within its available resources and that all that could be\r\nexpected of it was to take reasonable steps\nwithin its available\r\nresources, aimed at a progressive fulfilment of everyoneâs right to\r\nhave access to sufficient water. It\nsubmitted that it did not have\r\nthe resources to provide sufficient free water to those who cannot\r\nafford to pay for water. In this\nregard the City relied on the fact\r\nthat the City as well as Johannesburg Water had emerged from periods\r\nof acute financial crises,\nthe fact that the City operates under\r\nbudgetary constraints and that it is not allowed to spend more than\r\nis brought in on its\noperating budget and the fact that there are\r\nmany other demands on its resources. The other demands on the Cityâs\r\nresources include\nprimary health care services, emergency services,\r\npublic transportation, delivery of other essential services such as\r\nwaste collection\nand electricity, development and maintenance of\r\nroads, storm water and other infrastructure, safety, security and\r\nhousing. The\nCity is required to balance different delivery and\r\ndevelopment expenditure priorities and in doing so budgeted to spend\r\nR17,8 billion\nof its projected operating revenue of R17,9 billion in\r\nthe 2006/2007 financial year. The largest portion of the Cityâs\r\ncapital\nbudget, namely R726m (or 34% of the budget), is directed to\r\nJohannesburg Water infrastructure projects. In addition the City\r\ndirects\nR570m to fund its Social Package which includes free water.\r\nThe City contends that it is unreasonable in these circumstances to\n\nrequire the provision of more free water to those who cannot afford\r\nto pay for such water, more so in the light of the fact that\nthere\r\nare some 105 000 households in informal settlements within the\r\nCity who do not have access to even basic water services\nand also the\r\nfact that, under the Cityâs so-called âsteppedâ or ârising\r\nblockâ tariff, water usage by lower income and\nlower volume users\r\nis heavily subsidised by higher income and high volume users.\n[38]\tHowever, the free water\r\npolicy of the City was adopted on the basis that it was in terms of\r\nthe\nWater Services Act obliged\nto provide the residents within its\r\narea of jurisdiction access to 6kl water per household per month or\r\n25 litres per person per\nday, that this obligation did not entail\r\nthat the provision had to be free to those who could not afford to\r\npay and that the obligation\nsuperseded the constitutional duty that\r\nit may have had before the Act was enacted. For the reasons stated\r\nthe policy was materially\ninfluenced by an error of law and falls to\r\nbe set aside on that basis.\n[39]\tThe court below held that\r\nthe Cityâs provision of 25 litres of free water per person per day\r\nwas unreasonable and ordered\nthe City alternatively Johannesburg\r\nWater to provide each of the respondents and other similarly placed\r\nresidents of Phiri with\na free basic water supply of 50 litres per\r\nperson per day. However, the circumstances of the respondents are so\r\ndissimilar that\nit would be impossible to give effect to the order.\r\nFor example, the fourth respondent lives in a house with two others.\r\nThey are\ngetting 6kl water per month free ie approximately 60 litres\r\nper person per day. Her complaint is against a prepayment meter that\n\nhad not functioned properly. The fifth respondent lives in a house\r\njointly owned by him and his brother together with nine tenants.\nNo\r\ncase is made out that they cannot afford to pay for water. His\r\ncomplaint is that the water ran out when one of the shacks on\nhis\r\nproperty caught fire.\n[40]\tThe respondents submitted\r\nthat it would be appropriate in these circumstances to replace the\r\norder of the court below with\nan order that the City provide the\r\nquantity of water that is found to constitute sufficient water in\r\nterms of s 27(1) free\nof charge to every resident in Phiri.\r\nAccording to them, the Cityâs case on the papers is not that it\r\ncannot afford to do so\nand having failed to take action against\r\nnon-payers the City had in fact, for many years provided an unlimited\r\nquantity of water\nfree to the deemed consumption areas such as Phiri.\r\nThey submitted further that to now, except in special cases, provide\r\nonly 25\nlitres per person per day free is a retrogressive step.\n[41]\tThe City may of course be\r\nable to divert funds budgeted for other expenses and so make funds\r\navailable to provide sufficient\nwater free to every citizen in Phiri.\r\nBut it contends that it would be unreasonable to expect it to do so.\r\nMore so because an order\nthat the City should provide 42 litres of\r\nfree water to the residents of Phiri who cannot afford to pay for\r\nsuch water will in\neffect oblige the City to provide that quantity of\r\nwater free to other residents in the City whose circumstances are\r\nsimilar to\nthose of the Phiri residents.\n[42]\tHaving concluded that the\r\nCityâs free water policy falls to be reviewed and set aside a\r\nrevised free water policy which is\nreasonable has to be adopted. In\r\nformulating that policy regard should be had to the available\r\nresources and many competing interests.\nA reasonable balance will\r\nhave to be struck between those interests. In addition regard should\r\nbe had to logistical problems that\nwill have to be overcome in order\r\nto target those in need of free water in a practical and cost\r\neffective way. Without even knowing\nwhat the costs implications to\r\nthe City would be if the City were to provide 42 litres free water to\r\nall of its residents who cannot\nafford to pay for such water and\r\nwithout the expertise to deal with the logistical problems, it would\r\nbe irresponsible of a court\nto usurp the function of the City and to\r\nitself revise the Cityâs free water policy. The court is in no\r\nposition to do so whereas\nthe City should have the knowledge and\r\nexpertise required to do the exercise. As was said in\nBato\r\nStar Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Others\n[2004] ZACC 15\n;\n2004 (4) SA 490\n(CC) at para 45:\nâ\nThe Court should\r\ntake care not to usurp the functions of administrative agencies. Its\r\ntask is to ensure that the decisions taken\nby administrative agencies\r\nfall within the bounds of reasonableness as required by the\r\nConstitution.â\n[43]\tFor these reasons the matter\r\nshould be referred back to the City to formulate a revised water\r\npolicy in the light of the finding\nthat it is constitutionally\r\nobliged to grant each Phiri resident who cannot afford to pay for\r\nwater access to 42 litres of water\nper day free in so far as it can\r\nreasonably be done having regard to its available resources and other\r\nrelevant considerations.\n[44]\tThe respondents submitted\r\nthat the constitutional rights of the residents of Phiri have been\r\nviolated and that, as a result,\nthose that cannot afford to pay for\r\nwater have been forced to live in squalor for years. Referring to\r\ns 38 of the Constitution\nwhich provides that a court may grant\r\nappropriate relief in respect of an infringement of a right in the\r\nBill of Rights they submitted\nthat only effective relief would\r\nconstitute appropriate relief. In\nFose\r\nv Minister of Safety and Security\n[1997] ZACC 6\n;\n1997 (3) SA 786\n(CC) at para 69 Ackermann J said:\nâ\n[A]n appropriate\r\nremedy must mean an effective remedy, for without effective remedies\r\nfor breach, the values underlying and the\nright entrenched in the\r\nConstitution cannot properly be upheld or enhanced. \r\nParticularly in a country where so few have the\nmeans to enforce\r\ntheir rights through the courts, it is essential that on those\r\noccasions when the legal process does establish\nthat an infringement\r\nof an entrenched right has occurred, it be effectively vindicated. \r\nThe courts have a particular responsibility\nin this regard and are\r\nobliged to âforge new toolsâ and shape innovative remedies, if\r\nneeds be, to achieve this goal.â\n[45]\tHaving regard to the fact\r\nthat the recommendations contained in the Social Package Base\r\nDocument dated 8 June 2006 are apparently\nstill under consideration\r\nwhile there is a dispute about the extent to which the interim\r\nmeasures adopted by the City in the light\nof those recommendations\r\nhave been implemented, the respondents submitted that it would take a\r\nlong time for the City to adopt\na revised policy in the light of the\r\nfindings of this court. In the meantime the constitutional rights of\r\nthe residents of Phiri\nwill be violated and they will have to\r\ncontinue living in squalor. To refer the matter back to the City\r\nwould in these circumstances\nnot constitute effective relief. When\r\nasked to formulate an order having regard to the logistical problems\r\nthat will be encountered\nin giving effect to an order that a certain\r\nquantity of water had to be provided to all Phiri residents who\r\ncannot afford to pay\nfor water, the respondents could do no better\r\nthan suggest that the City should be allowed to identify the people\r\nwho qualify for\nfree water by any reasonable means. That is to say,\r\nat least in respect of the identification of people entitled to free\r\nwater,\nthey conceded that the matter had to be referred back to the\r\nCity for them to adopt an appropriate policy. However, they suggested\n\nthat an interim order should be made that sufficient water must be\r\nprovided free to all inhabitants of Phiri so as to serve as\nan\r\nincentive to the City to adopt a revised free water policy as soon as\r\npossible.\n[46]\tAn interim order will indeed\r\nbe an effective order pending the implementation of a revised water\r\npolicy. There is however no\nreason why, in the interim, free water\r\nshould be provided to inhabitants of Phiri who can afford to pay for\r\nthe water. The question\nthen is how to identify those than cannot do\r\nso. At least as an interim measure there would not seem to be any\r\nother practical\nway than to do what the City has done and that is to\r\nuse the Cityâs Register of Indigents as a basis for targeting poor\r\nhouseholds.\nThere are 118 549 accountholders registered as\r\nindigents and provision is made in section 23(1) of the Cityâs\r\nCredit Control\nand Debt Collection By-laws for applications to be\r\nregistered as an indigent. An order that 42 litres of free water per\r\nperson\nper day be provided to those households should not cause undue\r\nhardship to the City because in terms of the interim measures adopted\n\nby the City, 10kl of free water per month is already provided to\r\nthese households. As a result households registered on the register\n\nof indigents and consisting of 8 or less people are being provided\r\nwith 42 litres free water per person per day. Such an order\nwould\r\nnevertheless ensure that those in dire need of water would not have\r\nto go without sufficient water pending the adoption and\n\nimplementation of a revised free water policy by the City. It would\r\nput some pressure on the City to adopt and implement a revised\npolicy\r\nas soon as possible.\nPrepayment meters\n[47]\tAs stated above the City\r\nprovided an unlimited unmetered quantity of water to the residents of\r\nSoweto including Phiri and charged\nthem on the basis of a deemed\r\nconsumption of 20kl per month. However, the infrastructure was in a\r\nlamentable condition. The piping\nsystem was chaotic and there were\r\nfundamental technical problems in that it was incompatible with\r\npressure systems resulting in\nfractures and innumerable leaks in\r\nprimary and secondary water reticulation. As a result of the deemed\r\nconsumption system coupled\nwith the chaotic water reticulation\r\ninfrastructure the actual âconsumptionâ, including wastage and\r\nleaks of water in Soweto,\nwas in the order of 67kl per household per\r\nmonth. That was not the only problem faced by Johannesburg Water. The\r\npayment rate of\nmunicipal bills was less than 10%. Non-paying account\r\nholders amassed substantial arrears on their accounts. The City\r\nascribes\nthe non-payment for water services to a culture of\r\nnon-payment which took root in the 1980âs under the apartheid\r\nsystem. In the\nresult, as is stated by Karen Brits in the answering\r\naffidavit filed by the City, those consumers were in effect receiving\r\nunlimited\nfree water. This situation was considered by the City to be\r\nunsustainable. However, the City does recognise that many of the\r\nresidents\nare not able to pay for the water provided to them.\n[48]\tThe problems with the deemed\r\nconsumption system and the water reticulation infrastructure led to\r\nthe appointment in mid-late\nJune 2001 of a project team within\r\nJohannesburg Water to devise a strategy to reduce unaccounted for\r\nwater in the deemed consumption\nareas. The project was called\r\nOperation Gcinâmanzi (âOGAâ). A report was prepared by the OGA\r\ntask team in terms of which\nthey recommended that prepayment water\r\nmeters be installed. The report added: âAs prepayment represents\na\r\nmajor paradigm shift from conventional metering\nand enforces payment for services electronically, prepayment should\nnot\nbe enforced on customers until such time as majority acceptance\r\n(critical mass) has been obtained, i.e.\ninstallation\r\nof a prepayment meter on any property should be by choice of the\r\ncustomer per predefined area\n.â\r\nThe report was adopted and it was decided that a pilot project should\r\nfirst be undertaken in a prototype area. Phiri was selected\nfor the\r\npilot project. Construction of the âbulk infrastructureâ phase of\r\nthe project started on 11 August 2003 and the installation\nof\r\nprepayment meters in Phiri was completed in February 2005.\n[49]\tThe court below, referring\r\nto\ns 21\nof the\nWater Services Act (which\nprovides that every\r\nwater services authority such as the City must make bylaws which\r\ncontain conditions for the provision of water\nservices) and to the\r\nbylaws made by the City, held that the bylaws did not authorise the\r\ninstallation of prepayment meters in respect\nof the water services\r\nrendered to the respondents.\n[50]\tIn terms of bylaw 3 of the\r\nCityâs Water Services By-Laws the City may provide three levels of\r\nservice. Service level 1 must\nconsist of a water supply from communal\r\nwater points and a ventilated improved pit latrine located on each\r\nsite. Service level\n2 must consist of an unmetered water connection\r\nto each stand with an individual yard standpipe; a water borne\r\nconnection connected\nto either a municipal sewer or a shallow\r\ncommunal sewer system; and a pour flush toilet which must not be\r\ndirectly connected to\nthe water installation. Service level 3 must\r\nconsist of a metered full pressure water connection to each stand and\r\na conventional\nwater borne drainage installation connected to the\r\nCityâs sewer. The level of service to be provided to a community\r\nmay be established\nin accordance with the policy of the City and\r\nsubject to the conditions determined by the City. The provision of\r\nservice level\n2 is subject to certain conditions and in terms of\r\nbylaw 3(3) the City, in the event of a consumer receiving service\r\nlevel 2 contravening\ncertain of those conditions, may install a\r\nprepayment meter in the service pipe on the premises.\n[51]\tThe City submitted that, in\r\nthe case of Phiri, service level 3 is provided to consumers and that\r\nthe use of prepayment meters\nis authorised because level 3 requires a\r\nâmetered full pressure water connectionâ without specifying the\r\nnature of the meter\nto be used.\n[52]\tIn my view âmeteredâ in\r\nthe specifications of a level 3 service was not intended to include\r\nâmeteredâ by way of a prepayment\nmeter. If that was the intention\r\none would have expected that to have been mentioned expressly in the\r\nlight of the specific authorization\nto install prepayment meters in\r\nrespect of the level 2 service by way of a penalty for having\r\nbreached the conditions upon which\nthat service is being provided.\r\nOne would also have expected mention being made of the circumstances\r\nunder which prepayment meters\ninstead of a credit meters may be used.\r\nMore so in the light of the statement in the OGA report that\r\nprepayment in respect of water\nrepresents â\na\r\nmajor paradigm shift from conventional metering\nâ.\n[53]\tThere are several other\r\nindications that âmeteredâ was not intended to include metered by\r\nway of a prepayment meter.\nSection 7(1)\nrequires every consumer on\r\napplication for the provision of water services and before such water\r\nservices are provided to deposit\nwith the City a sum of money equal\r\nto the estimated fees for two average monthsâ water services as\r\ndetermined by the City. If\nâmeteredâ was intended to include\r\nprepayment it is unlikely that the same deposit would have been\r\nrequired from those applying\nfor the provision of prepaid water\r\nservices as from those applying for the provision of water services\r\non credit. Not surprisingly\nwe were informed at the hearing that no\r\ndeposit is required in respect of prepaid water services.\n[54]\tIn terms of\ns 4\nof the\nWater Services Act water\nservices must be provided in terms of\r\nconditions set by the water services provider and these conditions\r\nmust provide for the circumstances\nunder which water services may be\r\nlimited or discontinued and for procedures for limiting or\r\ndiscontinuing water services. Furthermore,\nprocedures for the\r\nlimitation or discontinuation of water services must be fair and\r\nequitable, provide for reasonable notice of\nintention to limit or\r\ndiscontinue the services and for an opportunity to make\r\nrepresentations. They may not result in a person\nbeing denied access\r\nto basic water services for non-payment, where that person proves to\r\nthe satisfaction of the relevant water\nservices authority that he or\r\nshe is unable to pay for basic services.\n[55]\tThe City submitted that the\r\ncut-off of the water supply by a prepayment meter does not amount to\r\na discontinuation of water\nservices because the water services are\r\nstill available against payment. On that basis one can argue that\r\nwater services are not\ndiscontinued to a consumer to whom water is\r\nprovided on credit when the water supply is cut-off due to\r\nnon-payment. The only difference\nbeing that in the case of prepayment\r\nmeters the customer can himself restore the supply whereas in the\r\ncase of credit meters the\nco-operation of the supplier is required.\r\nIn my view a cut-off of water services by a prepayment meter when the\r\ncredit runs out\nclearly amounts to a discontinuation of the services\r\n(see\nR v Director\r\ngeneral of Water Services\n[1999] Env. L.R. 114 (QB)).\n[56]\tAs stated above, in terms of\ns 4\nof the\nWater Services Act water\nservices must be provided in\r\nterms of conditions set by the water services provider which must\r\naccord with conditions for the provision\nof water services contained\r\nin bylaws. The Cityâs Water Services By-Laws provide for the\r\ncircumstances under which water services\nmay be discontinued and for\r\nprocedures for doing so\n(s 9.C).\nSubsection 6 for example\r\nprovides for the sending of a discontinuation notice in the event of\r\nnon-payment which notice must contain\ninformation advising the\r\nconsumer of steps which can be taken to have the service reconnected.\r\nSubsection 7 requires a final demand\nnotice in the event of\r\nrepresentations having been unsuccessful. Subsection 8 states under\r\nwhat circumstances water services to\na consumer may be discontinued.\r\nThese provisions provide for cut-offs for non-payment but do not\r\nauthorise the cut-off by a prepayment\nmeter. The City submitted that\r\nthe prepayment meters are designed to give a warning signal before\r\nthe credit is exhausted and that,\nsince the hearing of the case in\r\nthe court below, representations can be made to the City not to\r\ndiscontinue the service when the\ncredit runs out. The respondents\r\ndispute that a special cases representation procedure has been\r\nimplemented and contend that the\nprepayment meters in Phiri, in any\r\nevent, give no warning that would allow sufficient time for\r\nrepresentations or for purchasing\nfurther water credits so as to\r\navoid the cut-off. However that may be, if âmeteredâ in bylaw 3\r\nwas intended to apply also to\nmetered by way of prepayment meters,\r\nthe bylaws would have stipulated, as in the case of credit meters, as\r\nto what warning had\nto be given before the water services could be\r\ndiscontinued and would have contained, as in the case of credit\r\nmeters, comprehensive\nprovisions as to the making of representations.\n[57]\tThe City contends that\r\nbylaws 31, 8A and 31A(2) make it clear that prepayment meters may be\r\nused. These bylaws do refer to\nprepayment meters but the provisions\r\nwhich refer to prepayment meters are necessitated by the fact that,\r\nas stated above, the bylaws\ndo authorise the installation of\r\nprepayment meters as a penalty for a breach of conditions imposed in\r\nrespect of level 2 services.\nThe City also submitted that the use of\r\nprepayment meters is envisaged in the\nLocal Government: Municipal\nSystems Act 32 of 2000\n. In terms of\ns 95(i)\nthereof a\r\nmunicipality must within its financial and administrative capacity\r\nprovide accessible pay points and other mechanisms\nfor settling\r\naccounts or for making pre-payments. That the section envisages\r\nprepayments is clear but that is a far cry from authorising\n\nprepayment water meters. In addition the City referred to s 156(5)\r\nof the Constitution which provides that a municipality\nhas the right\r\nto exercise any power concerning a matter reasonably necessary for,\r\nor incidental to, the effective performance of\nits functions. It\r\nsubmitted that the introduction of prepayment meters in the\r\ncircumstances prevailing in Phiri, falls within the\npowers reasonably\r\nnecessary for, and incidental to, those powers expressly articulated\r\nin the Constitution and national legislation.\nThat may be so but the\r\nargument loses sight of the fact that the Council of the City in\r\nterms of the bylaws decided what water\nservices would be provided to\r\nconsumers. The question therefore remains whether the bylaws\r\nauthorise the use of prepayment meters\nin the case of level 3 water\r\nservices.\n[58]\tFor the reasons mentioned I\r\nam of the view that the Cityâs Water Services By-Laws do not\r\nauthorise the installation of prepayment\nwater meters in respect of\r\nits level 3 water services and that such installation was unlawful.\r\nOnce again the question arises as\nto what the appropriate remedy\r\nwould be. The court below made the following order:\nâ\n183.2\tThe forced\r\ninstallation of prepayment water meter system in Phiri Township by\r\nthe City of Johannesburg alternatively Johannesburg\nWater (Pty) Ltd\r\nwithout the choice of all available water supply options, is declared\r\nunconstitutional and unlawful.\n183.3\tThe choice\r\ngiven by the City of Johannesburg  alternatively Johannesburg Water\r\n(Pty) Ltd to the applicants and other similarly\nplaced residents of\r\nPhiri of either a prepayment water supply or supply through\r\nstandpipes is declared unconstitutional and unlawful.\n183.4\tThe prepayment\r\nwater system used in Phiri Township is declared unconstitutional and\r\nunlawful.\n183.5\tThe City of\r\nJohannesburg alternatively Johannesburg Water (Pty) Ltd is ordered to\r\nprovide each applicant and other similarly\nplaced residents of Phiri\r\nTownship with â\n183.5.1\t. . .\n183.5.2\tthe option\r\nof a metered supply installed at the cost of the City of\r\nJohannesburg.â\nIf the prepayment water system\r\nused in Phiri in respect of the level 3 service is unlawful as I have\r\nfound it to be, it follows\nthat the installation thereof and the\r\nchoice given to the residents of Phiri (that was a choice between a\r\nlevel 3 and a level 2\nwater service) was unlawful. There was\r\ntherefore no need for the orders in paragraphs 183.2 and 183.3.\n[59]\tHaving been declared\r\nunlawful, the City was obliged to remove the prepayment meters. I do\r\nnot think that was the appropriate\nremedy in the circumstances.\r\nAccording to the City the residents of Phiri are better off with\r\nprepayment meters and many of them\nprefer to have them; no other\r\nmechanism allows a guaranteed monthly delivery of free water; the\r\nintroduction of prepayment meters\ninvolved massive capital\r\nexpenditure (as of September 2007 a total of 82 591 had been\r\ninstalled); and the implementation of\nOGA has been effective,\r\nresulting in a dramatic reduction in the level of unaccounted for\r\nwater, enabling the City to plan for\nthe extension of basic water\r\ninfrastructure to the estimated 105 000 households that do not\r\nhave access to basic water.\n[60]\tIn the circumstances an\r\norder having the effect that the prepayment meters that have already\r\nbeen installed should be removed\nis inappropriate. The City, by\r\namending its bylaws, to at least some extent may alleviate the\r\nproblems caused by the unauthorized\ninstallation of the prepayment\r\nmeters. By doing so it may be able to retain the prepayment meters at\r\nleast in respect of consumers\nwho prefer to have them and possibly\r\nalso in respect of those who cannot pay a deposit or who do not pay\r\ntheir accounts. For these\nreasons the appropriate order would in my\r\nview be to suspend the order of unlawfulness for a period of two\r\nyears to enable the\nCity to take such steps as it may be advised to\r\ntake to legalise the use of prepayment water meters.\n[61]\tThe appellants do not ask\r\nfor a costs order against the respondents and have achieved a\r\nsufficient measure of success in this\nappeal not to be ordered to pay\r\nany of the respondentsâ costs.\n[62]\tFor these reasons the\r\nfollowing order is made:\nThe appeal is upheld and the\r\norder by the court below is replaced with the following order:\nâ\n1\tThe decision of the first\r\nrespondent and/or the second respondent to limit the free basic water\r\nsupply to the residents of Phiri\nto 25 litres per person per day or 6\r\nkl per household per month is reviewed and set aside.\n2\tIt is declared:\n(a)\tThat 42 litres water per\r\nPhiri resident per day would constitute sufficient water in terms of\r\ns 27(1) of the Constitution.\n(b)\tThat the first respondent is,\r\nto the extent that it is in terms of s 27(1) of the Constitution\r\nreasonable to do so, having\nregard to its available resources and\r\nother relevant considerations, obliged to provide 42 litres free\r\nwater to each Phiri\nresident who cannot afford to pay for such water.\n3\tThe first and second\r\nrespondents are ordered to reconsider and reformulate their free\r\nwater policy in the light of the preceding\nparagraphs of this order.\n4\tPending the reformulation of\r\ntheir free water policy the first and second respondents are ordered\r\nto provide each accountholder\nin Phiri who is registered with the\r\nfirst respondent as an indigent with 42 litres of free water per\r\nday per member of his\nor her household.\n5\tIt is declared that the\r\nprepayment water meters used in Phiri Township in respect of water\r\nservice level 3 consumers are unlawful.\n6\tThe order in paragraph 5 is\r\nsuspended for a period of two years in order to enable the first\r\nrespondent to legalise the use of\nprepayment meters in so far as it\r\nmay be possible to do so.â\n___________________\nP E STREICHER\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor 1\nst\nappellant:\tG Marcus SC\nA Stein\nFor 2\nnd\nappellant:\tK D Moroka SC\nK Pillay\nInstructed by:\nBowman Gilfillan Inc, Sandton,\r\nJohannesburg (1\nst\n& 2\nnd\n)\nMcIntyre & Van der Post,\r\nBloemfontein\nThe Minister of Water Affairs &\r\nForestry, C/o The State Attorney, Johannesburg (3\nrd\n)\nState Attorney, Bloemfontein\nFor respondent:\tW Trengove SC\nN Fourie\nInstructed by:\nCals Litigation Unit,\r\nBraamfontein, Johannesburg\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nAmicus curiae:\tR Moultrie\nM S Baloyi\nAmicus Curiae:\tLegal Resources\r\nCentre, Johannesburg\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\n1\nAt paras 95-96.\n2\nS v Zuma and Others\n[1995] ZACC 1\n;\n1995 (2) SA 642\n(CC) para 15; and\nS v\r\n\tMakwanyane and Another\n[1995] ZACC 3\n;\n1995 (3) SA 391\n(CC) para 9 and 10.\n3\nSoobramoney v Minister of Health (Kwazulu-Natal)\n[1997] ZACC 17\n;\n1998 (1) SA\r\n\t765\n(CC) at para 8.\n4\nPara 1.\n5\nPara 3.\n6\nPara 11.\n7\nMinister of Health and Others v Treatment Action Campaign and\r\n\tOthers\n(No 2)\n[2002] ZACC 15\n;\n2002 (5) SA 721\n(CC) para 35.\n8\nAt para 12(c).",

    "facts": "The residents of Phiri township in Soweto were historically supplied with unlimited unmetered water based on a deemed consumption of 20 kl per month. In 2004 the City of Johannesburg replaced this with pre‑payment meters, providing 6 kl free per stand each month and requiring payment for any additional usage. The free basic water allocation of 25 litres per person per day (or 6 kl per household) was deemed insufficient by the residents, who argued that, given the need for water‑borne sanitation, a higher quantity (approximately 42–50 litres per person per day) was required for dignified living. Five respondents, all residents of Phiri, applied for an order that the City provide sufficient free water and declared the pre‑payment meter system unlawful.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the City of Johannesburg and Johannesburg Water have a constitutional duty under section 27(1) of the Constitution to provide free water to Phiri residents who cannot afford to pay. 2. Whether the pre‑payment water meters installed in Phiri are authorised by the City’s water‑services bylaws and therefore lawful.",
    "principles": "The Court applied section 27(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to sufficient water, and section 27(2), which obliges the state to take reasonable measures within available resources. The Water Services Act 108 of 1997 and its regulations set a statutory minimum of 25 litres per person per day (6 kl per household) as a basic water supply, but do not exhaust the constitutional right to sufficient water. The Court rejected the ‘direct‑reliance’ rule where legislation merely implements a constitutional right, holding that the Constitution still requires progressive realisation of sufficiency. It also examined the interpretation of “metered” service level 3 under the City’s bylaws, concluding that pre‑payment meters were not contemplated and therefore unlawful.",
    "application": "The Court evaluated expert evidence on water needs, accepting that 42 litres per person per day constituted sufficient water for the Phiri community. It held that the City, considering its resources, must provide this quantity free of charge to indigent residents. Regarding the meters, the Court found the bylaws did not authorise pre‑payment meters for service level 3 and declared their installation unlawful, but suspended the order for two years to allow the City to regularise the meters where possible.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The earlier order limiting free basic water to 25 litres per person per day was set aside. The Court declared that 42 litres per person per day is sufficient water and that the City must provide this amount free to Phiri residents who cannot pay, subject to reasonable resource constraints. The City must reformulate its free‑water policy. Pre‑payment water meters were declared unlawful, with the declaration suspended for two years to enable legalisation."
