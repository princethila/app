Mr Adams was\nExpectraâs managing director. Pursuant to the negotiations, Quantum\nand Expectra\nconcluded an âoffer to leaseâ which was to remain\nbinding until substituted by a standard lease agreement. To that end,\nClause 10(b) of the Offer to\nLease provided:\nâ\nOn acceptance of this Offer the Lessorâs\nstandard Agreement of Lease will be prepared and signed by both\nparties in substitution\nof this Agreement within 30 days of date\nhereof. In the event that both or either of the parties refuse or\nfail to sign such standard\nLease Agreement, then this Agreement shall\ncontinue to bind both parties.â\n[3]\nBy agreement initiated by Mrs Adams\nbetween Quantum and Expectra, the respondent, a Toyota car franchise\nwith, incidentally, the same\nthree directors as Expectra, substituted\nthe latter as the tenant in the final lease agreement (the lease\nagreement). The respondent\nsigned it on 19 November 2002 and\ncommenced building alterations to the premises to suit its trading\nspecifications. It took occupation\nof the premises in February 2003.\n[4] \tBoth the offer to lease and the lease agreement\ngranted the respondent an option to purchase the premises. Clause\n16.1 of the\noffer to lease provided:\nâThe landlord will provide the tenant with an option to purchase\nthe property for R2 000 000.00 excluding VAT for a 24-month period\nfrom date of occupation, subject to approval from Pick `n Pay [the\nlandlordâs anchor tenant], approval from the City Council for\nsub-division and approval from Quantum Leap Investments 230 (Pty) Ltd\nfor reciprocal access and parking agreement (See plan attached).â\nThese provisions were replicated in Clause 7 of the\nlease agreement, albeit without the conditions relating to VAT and\nthe various\nforms of approval from Pick `n Pay, the City Council and\nQuantum (I shall deal with the omission of the conditions later) and\nread:\nâArea of Leased Premises:\n7.1\t This lease automatically entitles the tenant with the first\noption to purchase the said property as per annexure âEâ [the\nsite plan] within 2 years of date of signature hereof, the property\ntotalling 3445sqm i.e. 1779sqm in addition to the leased premises.\n7.2 \tThe said property referred to in 7.1 above, shall constitute the\nentire area leased in terms hereof i.e. 847sqm plus an additional\n529sqm for the extension and 290sqm for the undercover vehicle\ndisplay, totalling 1666sqm.\n7.3\t It is further hereby expressly agreed that the tenant will be\nentitled to upon signature hereof also utilize the additional\nspace\nreferred to above (819sqm) which is situated at the front of the\nleased premises.â\n[5]\t A few days after Quantum signed the lease\nagreement, on 25 February 2003, it sold the entire shopping centre to\nthe appellant\nwhich took transfer on 15 June 2003. It is clear from\nthe relevant deed of sale concluded by Quantum and the appellant that\nthe latter\nhad notice of the respondentâs option at the time of\npurchase as clause 6.4.2, one of its warranty provisions, provides:\nâThe Seller [Quantum] warrants and undertakes to the Purchaser [the\nappellant] â¦ no agreements have been entered into by the\nSeller\nwhereby any restrictive conditions or servitudes or other real rights\nattach to the property or in terms of which any person,\nnatural or\ncorporate, is entitled to obtain any real rights to the property,\nsave for existing tenant, Ottery Toyota, [the respondent] who have\nlimited rights to purchase their section subject to a subdivision\nof\nthe land\n.â (My emphasis.)\n[6]\t Shortly after transfer, during June or July 2003\naccording to the pleadings, the respondent sought to exercise the\noption against\nthe appellant by way of an undated letter. In\ncorrespondence that followed, the appellant pointed out that the\nrespondentâs option\nwas subject to the conditions reflected in the\noffer to lease. This was denied by the respondent. The final letter\nfrom the appellantâs\nattorneys, dated 28 October 2004, reads:\nâOur client considers that it is bound by the option agreement but\nthat due to an error common to the parties, the three conditions\ncontained in the offer to rent were not carried forward into the\nultimate lease agreement and that the lease agreement accordingly\nfalls to be rectified.â\n[7]\t The respondent had, in the meantime, obtained a\nwritten undertaking from Pick `n Pay that the latter did not object\nto the respondentâs\ncontemplated purchase of the premises. More\ncorrespondence flowed between the parties but the impasse remained.\nConsequently, the\nrespondent instituted action proceedings against\nthe appellant in the Cape High Court. The basis of its claim, which\nwas pursued\nin this court, was that the appellant substituted Quantum\nand was bound by the option, which was an integral part of the lease\nagreement,\nas Quantumâs rights and obligations concerning that\nagreement were assigned to it through the purchase and that the\nappellant had\naccepted and implemented such assignment. It was\nalternatively contended that the appellant had acknowledged the\noptionâs existence\nand exercise albeit in different terms. The\nassignment therefore arose from the rule â\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nâ â hire takes precedence\nover sale â alternatively clause 6.4.2 of the deed of sale and the\nappellantâs letters acknowledging\nthe option.\n[8] \tThe appellant raised various defences, including\nthat it had not become party to the option the purported exercise of\nwhich it\ncontended was, in any event, invalid for failure to comply\nwith the provisions of s 2(1) of the Alienation of Land Act 68 of\n1981\n(the Act).\n1\nIt also counterclaimed for rectification of the lease agreement to\nincorporate the disputed conditions in the event that a finding\nwas\nmade in the respondentâs favour.\n[9] \tThe matter was heard by Zondi J, who, on the\nstrength of the respondentâs submissions, ordered the appellant to\nprocure the\napproval of the Cape Town City Council for the\nsubdivision of the premises and effect transfer to the respondent,\nbut dismissed its\ncounterclaim for rectification. The learned judge\nthen granted the respondent leave to appeal to this court only in\nrespect of the\nvalidity of the option. Upon further application to\nthis court, the appellant was granted leave to appeal against the\ndismissal of\nits counterclaim and a directive was issued for all the\nissues to be determined simultaneously.\n[10]\t The issues on appeal\n2\nare (a) whether the option became binding upon the appellant as a\nresult of its purchase of the premises by virtue of either the\noperation of the rule â\nhuur gaat voor koopâ\nor on any other legal basis; (b) whether the respondentâs exercise\nof the option against the appellant gave rise to a valid agreement\nof\nsale which met the requirements of the Act notwithstanding the\nabsence of a new written deed of sale; and, if the answer to (a)\nand\n(b) is âYesâ, (c) whether the terms of the option ought to be\nrectified as claimed by the appellant in its counterclaim.\n[11]\t In sum, the appellantâs contentions before us\nwere (a) that the operation of the rule â\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nâ does not, as a matter of\nlaw, result in the transfer from the original lessor to the new owner\nof the rights and obligations contained\nin an option to purchase\nimmoveable property reflected in a lease agreement upon the sale of\nthe property; (b) that the said rights\nand obligations are not\nincidents of the lease which can be transferred to the new owner, and\nthus remain effective only between\nthe lessee and the original\ngrantor of the  option; and (c) that the option must be signed by\nboth the grantor and the grantee to\namount to a written deed of\nalienation as envisaged by s 2(1) of the Act â one signed by both\nparties or their agents acting on\ntheir written authority â to be\nenforceable.\n[12]\t In considering whether the â\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nâ rule is relevant to the\nresolution of the issues it is necessary to examine briefly its\nsource and the development of the principles\nwhich relate to it. In\nthat regard, the following may be gleaned from various texts on our\nlaw and decisions of our courts.\n3\nIn Roman law a lessee did not have a real right in the leased\nproperty, but merely enjoyed a personal right against the lessor on\nthe lease contract. If the lessor sold the property the buyer could\ngenerally evict the lessee as he had no duty to recognise the\nlesseeâs rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had\nundertaken to do so.\n[13]\t As a result of the lesseeâs untenable situation\nand a need to cure the inequity, the rule evolved from local customs\nand legislation\nrelating to the lease of land and housing in parts of\nthe Netherlands and Holland as an equitable measure to give the\nlessee security\nof tenure where the leased property was alienated. It\nbecame part of Roman-Dutch law and, ultimately, South African law in\nthat form.\n4\nThe rule therefore has its origins in equitable principles and, apart\nfrom the fact that it applies to agreements of the letting\nand hiring\nof land and buildings, has never been clearly defined regarding its\nprecise scope and consequence.\n[14]\t This much is, however, settled in our law:\nsuccessors in title to owners of leased property are bound to\nrecognise the existence\nof the lease and an\nex\nlege\nsubstitution of the purchaser for the\nlessor-seller takes place in the lease upon sale of such property.\nThus, the rule relieves\nthe seller of all rights and obligations\nflowing from the lease which are transferred to the buyer on\ntransfer.\n5\nThis view found expression in the\nMignoel\nProperties\n6\ndecision on which the respondent heavily\nrelied. There, this court said:\nâ[O]nce the lessee elects to remain in the leased premises after a\nsale, the seller\nex lege\nfalls out of the picture and his\nplace as lessor is taken by the purchaser. No new contract comes into\nexistence; all that happens\nis that the purchaser is substituted for\nthe seller as lessor without the necessity for a cession of rights or\nan assignment of obligations.\nOn being so substituted for the seller,\nthe purchaser acquires all the rights which the seller had in terms\nof the lease, except,\nof course, collateral rights unconnected with\nthe lease.â\nThis position has been endorsed in later decisions of\nthis court:\nGennae-Wae Properties\n7\nand\nSA Breweries Ltd v\nVan Zyl\n.\n8\n[15] \tA question arises whether it can be accepted on\nthe basis of these principles that in stepping into Quantumâs shoes\nin terms\nof the lease agreement, the appellant also acquired the\nobligation relating to the respondentâs option as its counsel urged\nupon\nus. An apparent difficulty which presents is that the case\nraises a novel issue as none of our courts, and certainly none of the\nauthorities referred to above, have ever pertinently determined the\nextent of the effect of the â\nhuur gaat voor\nkoop\nâ rule on a lease agreement containing\nan option to purchase leased immovable property. By and large, our\ncourts have considered\nthe relevance of the rule in the context of\noptions to renew, rights of pre-emption and cession.\n[16]\t There is, nevertheless, persuasive authority to\nthe effect that an option to purchase may, in appropriate\ncircumstances, be\nbinding on a new owner. Authors W E Cooper\n9\nand A J Kerr\n10\nare of the view that\nthe\nproper approach in determining the applicability of the â\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nâ\nrule\nis to ask whether or not the option is an integral part of the\nagreement, such as where it was an inducement to contract or its\npresence had a bearing on the rent agreed upon, unless it is\nsupplementary to the main agreement â the question whether the\noption\nis separate from the lease agreement largely depending on the\ninterpretation of the contract as a whole.\n11\nThe authorsâ reasoning is that if the option impacts on the\ndetermination of the rental to which the new owner is entitled, it\nmust then follow that such new owner is bound by it as he becomes the\nlesseeâs debtor\nin toto\n,\n12\nunless the option forms a separate contract.\n[17] \tIn counter â and I shall deal incrementally with\neach leg of the argument outlined in para 11 as it developed â\ncounsel\nfor the appellant started with the submission that only the\nincidents of the direct relation of the lessee and lessor ie those\narising\nin relation to occupation, and not those that may relate to\ndominium of the property, such as an option to purchase, are\ntransferred\nin terms of the â\nhuur gaat voor\nkoop\nâ\nrule.\nHe relied for this contention on\nShalala &\nanother v Gelb\n13\nand\nHirschowitz v\nMoolman & others\n.\n14\nThe gist of the remarks of the provincial courts in these decisions,\nmade in passing as the appellant properly acknowledges, is that\nan\noption to purchase is a collateral obligation undertaken by the\noriginal lessor and that the rule has no application as between\ncompetitors for dominium.\n[18]\t With respect, I do not agree with this approach.\nIt is similar to Prof De Wetâs view,\n15\nwhich, as is pointed by Cooper,\n16\nis based on the premise that a new owner does not become the lesseeâs\ndebtor and is obliged only to suffer the lesseeâs rights\nof use,\ncontrary to the decisions of our courts that a new owner is bound by\nall the material terms of the lease and upon transfer\nof ownership\nthe lessor is divested of his obligations to the lessee. This view\nwas roundly rejected by this court in\nMignoel\nProperties\n.\n17\nThere, Friedman AJA reiterated the view expressed in\nKessoopersahd\n18\nthat the rule, being a creature of practical\nconsiderations of fairness, is\nsui generis\nin\nnature and is not subject to a strict application of the law of\ncontract, a factor which he said De Wet overlooked.\n[19]\tBut, despite my disagreement with Ogilvie Thompson\nJâs view in the\nShalala v Gelb\ndecision\n19\nthat options to purchase are not protected by the â\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nâ rule, I nonetheless find\nhis comments on the scope of the tenantâs right to renew the lease\ninstructive. The learned judge found\nthat considerations of principle\nand convenience and our courtsâ interpretation of the rule dictated\nthat the renewal period provided\nfor in a lease, even one of which\nthe purchaser was ignorant, falls to be included in the protection\nthat the rule accorded to the\ntenant.\n[20]\tThe basis of this finding â which was limited to\nthe right to renew a lease because it âis an extension of the\nduration of\na tenantâs right of occupationâ¦ which the rule â¦ is\ndesigned to protectâ and âforms a very material part of his\ninterest\nin the landâ â is expressed in the following remarks:\n20\nâAs regards the conditions of the existing lease, the purchaser is\nâ¦ admittedly bound â virtually in the position of the landlord\nvis-Ã -vis\nthe tenant â¦ Since the tenant must pay his rent\nto the purchaser, the original landlordâs right to claim rent in\nconsideration\nof the tenantâs occupation is gone; and there is thus\nmuch to be said, both on grounds of convenience and of equity, for\nthe view\nthat the obligation to recognize a renewal of the lease\nshould likewise pass from the original landlord to the purchaser. The\nalternative\nis to leave the tenant with an action for damages for\nbreach of contract against his original landlord: but it was to avoid\nthat\nvery result that the Roman-Dutch Law departed from the Roman Law\nwhereunder the tenant had only a personal right â¦ and applied\nthe\ndoctrine of huur gaat voor koop to the tenantâs right of\noccupation.â\n[21]\tThe learned judge further took the view that â[i]f\nthe innocent purchaser is to be held bound by the existing lease\nbecause,\nhad he enquired, he would have ascertained that there was a\ntenant in occupation of the premises under a lease, the same reason\nexists\nfor holding him bound by a right of renewal of that lease\nwhich right, had he made a proper enquiry, would have been revealed\nto\nhim.\n21\n[22]\tI see no reason why these considerations should not\napply to an option to purchase, which is a material component of and\nwas\na key motivating factor in the conclusion of the lease agreement.\nOur courts have made it clear that if an option to purchase is\nincorporated in a lease, principles similar to those on options to\nrenew apply.\n22\nThis view was expressed by this court in\nMittermeier\nv Skema Engineering (Pty) Ltd\n,\n23\nwhere Smuts AJA had to decide the longevity of an option to buy\nleased premises contained in an agreement of lease which did not\nstate when it was to be exercised. He said:\nâIt appears to me that where one finds an option to buy leased\npremises conferred on a lessee in an agreement of lease, with no\nmention of the period within which it is to be exercised, the\nagreement\nprima facie\n, and in the absence of contrary\nindications, means that the option is to be exercised before the\nexpiration of the lease. That is\nthe way in which leases containing a\nright of renewal without a clear statement of the period within which\nthe option to renew is\nto be exercised, have been interpreted in the\npast â¦ There appears to be no reason why an option to buy the\nleased premises should\nbe placed on a different footing.â\n[23]\t Another example is\nBanket\nHoldings v Levy\n24\nin which Murray CJ relied on the judgment of Wessels CJ in\nUys\n& another v Sam Friedman Ltd\n25\nf\nor\nhis dictum that a determination whether or not an option to purchase\nis collateral to the lease depends on the interpretation of\nall the\nterms of the agreement.\nIn\nUys\n,\nthe court considered whether the lease\nconferred upon the lessee an option of renewal which had influenced\nthe rental and said:\nâIf the option to renew a lease is a term or condition of the\nlease, as indeed in law it is, then it is difficult to see how it\ncan\nbe regarded as severable from the lease more than any other term of\nthe contract. Indeed the right to renew on the part of the\nlessee may\nbe a most important consideration and may very materially affect the\nrent payable, as we see at once when we consider\nthe case of a shop\nwhere the right to carry on trade in a particular locality is an\nimportant part of the goodwill. The right to\nrenew a lease which may\nform so important a part of the contract is no different from any\nother term or condition of the lease.â\n26\n[24]\t My view is further, fortified by Broome Jâs\nskepticism of the notion that options to purchase are collateral to a\nlease, expressed\nin\nArchibald & Co v\nStrachan & Co\n27\nas follows:\nâThe proposition that an option to purchase is not incident to the\nrelation of lessor and lessee may, for what it is worth, be\naccepted\nas in accordance with our law. But the contracting parties may insert\nin their contract what terms they please, and those\nterms, whether or\nnot they are incident to the relation of lessor and lessee, are\nmanifestly incident to the contract itself, for\nthe parties have so\nmade them.â\n[25]\tI can articulate my conviction that no inequity\narises from extending the protection afforded by the rule no better\nthan was\ndone by Greenberg JP in\nBoshoff v\nTheron\n.\n28\nIn that case the issue was whether a seller of leased premises was\ndivested of his obligation to provide his tenant with a power\nof\nattorney to enable him to draw water for watering his crops after the\nsale of the property. The court held:\nâIt does not seem a harsh provision that, in return for protection\nafforded him by the maxim, he should be required to look to\nthe\npurchaser, in place of the seller, for performance of the lessorâs\nobligations. In the ordinary obligations owed by a lessor\nâ¦ it can\nmake little difference to the lessee who his lessor is, in so far as\nhis legal rights are concerned â¦ [because] as regards\nthe lessor,\nthere is ordinarily no\ndelectus personae\n; the property itself\ngenerally affords the lessee sufficient security for the performance\nof the lessorâs obligations. The position\nmay be different where\nthe lease provides for an obligation on the lessor which calls for\nsome special quality on his part â¦ It\nis clear â¦ that the\npurchaser is bound by all the âmaterialâ terms of a contract of\nlease  entered into by his predecessor\nin title.â\n[26]\t To further bolster the appellantâs contention,\nan attempt was made to conflate the option to purchase with the right\nof pre-emption.\nIt was argued that transfer of rights and obligations\nex lege\ncannot take\nplace in the case of an option to purchase for the same reason that\nthe new owner would not automatically be substituted\nfor the original\nlessor in relation to obligations arising from the right of\npre-emption.\n[27]\t I find no merit in this submission because it\nignores the fundamental difference between the two rights. As was\npointed out\nby the respondent the right of pre-emption must be\noffered to the lessee and exercised before a sale of the leased\nproperty to a\nthird party. Where the lessee declines to purchase the\nproperty, the owner may then sell to a third party. This means that\nby the\ntime the third party comes on to the scene the pre-emptor has\nalready disappeared. The right has been extinguished. There is\ntherefore\nno room for a substitution and there is no one to replace.\n[28]\t Neither am I persuaded by the contention that the\napproach advocated by Cooper and Kerr, whether or not an option falls\nwithin\nthe ambit of the â\nhuur gaat voor\nkoop\nâ rule,\nmust\ndepend upon the facts of each case and on the severability or\notherwise of the right from the main agreement, was wrong because\n(a)\nit improperly sought to import principles applicable to options to\nrenew a lease contract to options to purchase  and (b) would\nresult\nin uncertainty contrary to the objectives of s 2(1) of the Act.\nExamples given in support of the latter submission were that\na\ndetermination of questions whether the grant of the option influenced\nthe fixing of the rent and the identity of the party against\nwhom the\noption could be exercised had the potential of creating disputes of\nfact and conflicting interpretations.\n[29]\tAs I have said, I have no difficulty with the\nimpugned approach. Reference must again be made to the\nsui\ngeneris\nnature of the rule and the fact that\nour courts accepted, early on, that the rule was not invariable in\nits operation and did not\nproduce the same result wherever it was\napplied.\n29\n[30]\t I have attempted to show in paragraph [22] that\nthe first concern has no basis as principles relating to options to\nrenew are\nequally applicable to options to purchase. The perceived\nrisk of uncertainty is, in my view, similarly baseless.  The\nexclusion in\nMignoel Properties\n30\nof âcollateral rights unconnected with the leaseâ from the ruleâs\nprotection, without specifying what those rights are, indicates\na\ndetermination of those rights on a case by case basis. And the\nrelevance of s 2(1) of the Act needs first to be established before\nits requirements are imposed on the case. In any event, our courts\nhave the means and are capable of resolving disputes of fact wherever\nthey arise.\n[31]\tMindful of the dangers of arguing by way of\nanalogy, I nevertheless find resonance in the remarks of Corbett CJ\nin\nAdministrator, Transvaal v\nTraub\n.\n31\nThe remarks\nrelated to the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectation which, albeit a different concept from the\nâ\nhuur gaat voor koopâ\nrule\nexisting in a\ndifferent legal sphere, similarly evolved as a concept based on\nequitable principles, to promote procedural fairness\nin\nadministrative decision-making, from âjudicial attempts to mediate\nbetween individual interests and collective demands in the\nmodern\nadministrative stateâ.\n32\nNotably, t\nhe\nlearned chief justice expressed no qualms with the fact that the\nconcept, which is not well defined, is applied on a case by case\nbasis and merely sounded this caution:\n33\nâ[W]hereas the concepts of liberty, property and existing rights\nare reasonably well defined, that of legitimate expectation is\nnot.\nLike public policy, unless carefully handled it could become an\nunruly horse. And, in working out, incrementally, on the facts\nof\neach case, where the doctrine of legitimate expectation applies and\nwhere it does not, the Courts will, no doubt, bear in mind\nthe need\nfrom time to time to apply the curb.â\n[32]\t In sum, I consider that the answer lies in whether\nthe respondentâs option was a material part of the lease agreement.\nThere\nis evidence available, which was adduced at the trial, from\nwhich the partiesâ intention in this regard may be ascertained. I\nmay\njust point out that the court below had made adverse credibility\nfindings against the appellantâs witness, Mr Codron, who had\nrepresented\nQuantum both in the lease negotiations and the subsequent\nsale transaction.\n[33]\t There was, happily, no controversy regarding the\nevidence relevant for this part of the enquiry. It seems to me that\nthis issue\nmay be disposed of shortly by reference to a portion of\nCodronâs testimony-in-chief. He was examined as follows:\nâDo you recall when the reference to an option to purchase was\nfirst raised?\nPrior to signing the offer to lease the issue was raised because of\nthe substantial amount of money being put in by [the respondent].\nâ¦\nAnd it was raised in what context?\nIf we would consider selling [the respondent] the property in future.\nâ¦\nAnd what was your response to the proposal with regard to an option?\nI discussed it with my partner who viewed it favourably as long as\ncertain conditions were adhered to.\nFirstly, how did you arrive at the [option] price?\nWe projected the rental going forward for twenty-four months. That\nwas the R18 000,00 a month [rental] escalating â I canât recall\nwhat the escalations were â but escalating over twenty-four months.\nAnd then applying a rate of capitalization on the asset at\nthat\npoint. That came to â we were satisfied with R2m plus VAT at that\npoint â¦ amenable to granting an option, but subject to\nconditions.â\n[34] \tIt is clear from this evidence that the\nsubstantial improvements that were going to be effected by the\nrespondent on the premises\ndirectly influenced the amount of rental\nthat was to be paid therefor and vice versa. It further provides\nample support for the respondentâs\nversion testified to by one of\nits directors, Mr Karriem, that without the grant of the option it\nwould not have expended R2m towards\nimproving premises that did not\nbelong to it which it could not recoup at the expiry of the lease,\nand that without the option there\nwould have been no lease. Without a\nshadow of doubt, the option was intended to be an integral, material\npart of the lease agreement.\n34\nIn my view, it is binding on the appellant.\n[35]\t It is binding for another reason too. The\nappellant agreed to clause 6.4.2 in the deed of sale and, upon\ntransfer, engaged in\ncorrespondence with the respondent acknowledging\nthe option. It was, however, argued on its behalf that the clause was\nmerely intended\nto put it on guard that Quantum owed an obligation to\nthe respondent in order to protect it from a claim for damages in the\nevent\nthat the respondent sought to enforce the option against it;\nthat it was, in any event, vague and did not indicate which agreement\nit referred to, alternatively that it referred to the offer to lease\nto which the respondent was not party, because of its mention\nof\nâsubject to subdivisionâ.\n[36]\t I find no ambiguity in the clause. It is so that\nit does not expressly refer to any specific agreement. It must,\nhowever, be\nconsidered that in terms of clause 10(b) of the offer to\nlease, Quantumâs âstandard Agreement of Lease would be prepared\nand\nsigned by both parties\nin substitution\nâ\nthereof on acceptance of the offer. The lease agreement therefore\nsuperceded the offer to lease as it had been signed when the\ndeed of\nsale was concluded and was the only agreement in existence at the\nmaterial time. It is only reasonable to assume that that\nfact would\nhave been brought to the appellantâs attention or that it would\nhave itself discovered it in its due diligence exercise\nspecified in\nthe deed of sale.\n[37]\t In any event, the clause refers to âthe existing\ntenant, Ottery Toyotaâ. That is the respondentâs trading name.\nThe reference\nto it excludes any possibility that the clause could\nrefer to Expectra, the lessee in the offer to lease which exited the\nscene when\nthe lease agreement was concluded. I also think that\nnothing turns on the reference to the subdivision of the premises\nwhich was\nreflected only in the offer to lease. Such condition is, in\nany case, implied by law, and it should be noted that the other\ndisputed\nconditions (included in the offer to lease but not in the\nlease itself) are not mentioned in clause 6.4.2, which points to a\nreference\nto the lease itself.\n[38]\t I am satisfied in the circumstances that the\nappellant accepted the validity of the option and its binding effect\nupon itself\nalbeit, perhaps,\n35\nsubject to the disputed conditions. On the assumption that the\nfinding of an\nex lege\nsubstitution of the appellant as lessor in Quantumâs place is not\nsufficient to meet the requirement of a written option to purchase\nsigned by its grantor in terms of the provisions of s 2(1) of the\nAct, my view is that Clause 6.4.2 fulfils such requirement.\n[39]\t In the premises, I find that a valid option\nagreement exists which was capable of being exercised and was in fact\nvalidly exercised\nby the respondent. These findings dispense with the\nneed to consider a further string to the appellantâs bow, that\nthere is an\narray of remedies available to a lessee that it can\ninvoke against the original lessor to protect its interests, such as\na claim\nfor specific performance or damages or an interdict which\ndivests from the respondent any need for the protection offered by\nthe\nâ\nhuur gaat voor koop\nâ\nrule.\n[40]\t It now remains to consider the appellantâs\ncounterclaim for rectification. The appellant seeks rectification of\nthe option\nagreement by the insertion of the words âexcluding VATâ\nafter the option price and, at the end thereof, the phrase âsubject\nto approval from Pick `n Pay, approval from the City Council for\nsub-division of the property and approval from Quantum to a\nreciprocal\naccess and parking agreementâ.\n[41]\t There was conflicting oral evidence regarding the\nomission of the disputed conditions in the lease agreement. According\nto Karriem,\nthe respondent successfully negotiated the exclusion of\nthe conditions through the Adamses and the lease agreement was\naccordingly\nprepared by the appellant to reflect the changes. Codron,\non the other hand, denied any agreement to omit the conditions. He\ntestified\nthat the lease agreement was a different document from that\ndrawn by the appellantâs agent and furnished to the respondent for\nsignature, presumably amended unilaterally by the respondentâs\nattorneys. He noticed the omission before signing the lease agreement\nand contacted Mrs Adams to enquire about the unauthorized changes.\nMrs Adams acknowledged the mistake and they agreed to an addendum\nto\nbe drawn by the appellant rectifying the situation. In the meantime,\nhe signed the lease agreement in its unchanged form to accommodate\nthe respondent which needed it urgently to secure finance.\nInexplicably, the addendum was never signed and he did not know what\nfinally\nhappened to it. The court below dismissed Codronâs\ntestimony in this regard as improbable.\n[42]\t It was argued before us that the basis for the\nappellantâs claim for rectification set out in its pleadings, a\nbona fide common\nerror, was not established by the evidence and that\nthe addendum referred to by Codron was similarly not pleaded by the\nappellant.\nParties should, of course, define the issues in their\npleadings so that they each know what case they have to meet\n36\nand should, therefore, be limited to such pleadings.\n37\nHowever, it is equally trite that since pleadings are made for the\ncourt and not the court for the pleadings, it is the duty of the\ncourt to determine the real issues between the parties, and provided\nno possible prejudice can be caused to either, to decide the\ncase on\nthose real issues.\n38\n[43]\t Thus, whilst there may be merit in the\nrespondentâs contentions in this regard, I do not consider myself\nbound to decide the\nissue on the basis of the inconsistent evidence.\nThe reason is that the partiesâ intention regarding the terms of\nthe lease is\nreadily ascertainable from the option granted by Quantum\nto the respondent. I believe that it would be remiss of this court to\nignore\nsuch clear, objective evidentiary material which was fully\ncanvassed at the trial where none of the parties can claim to have\nbeen\nmisled by the state of the pleadings.\n[44]\t The validity of the offer to lease in which the\ndisputed conditions were contained was not brought into question. As\nstated\nabove, in terms of its clause 10, the signed offer had the\nstatus of a binding lease until substituted by a standard lease\nagreement.\nSignificantly, in the event that a standard lease\nagreement did not come into being, the offer to lease would continue\nto bind the\nparties. It could be no clearer from the plain language\nof this clause that the intention of the contracting parties was that\nthe\nprovisions of the offer would be transposed to the lease\nagreement in their entirety, failing which they would remain bound by\nits\nterms. That being so, it must be accepted that the disputed\nconditions were intended to be part of the lease agreement and that\ntheir\nomission from this document was an error. The appellant is,\ntherefore, entitled to rectification in the terms it proposes.\n[45]\tIn the result, I would dismiss the appeal but order\nrectification of the lease agreement as prayed in the counterclaim;\neach\nparty to pay its own costs at both tiers of the proceedings in\nview of the substantial success which they have both enjoyed.\n___________________\nMML MAYA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\n________________________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\nHURT AJA (MPATI P, MTHIYANE, LEWIS JJA concurring):\n[46]\tI have had the benefit of reading the judgment\nprepared by my colleague, Maya JA. Unfortunately, I find myself in\nrespectful\ndisagreement with her conclusion that a valid agreement of\nsale resulted from the exercise of the option.\n[47]\tThe background facts have been set out in detail by\nMaya JA, but it is convenient to recount those which I regard as\nparticularly\npertinent to the view which I take. For ease of\nidentification I shall refer to the parties as follows: the original\nowner of the\nleased property with which this appeal is concerned will\nbe referred to as 'Quantum', the appellant as 'Spearhead' and the\nrespondent\nas 'E and D Motors'. In October 2002 Quantum let premises\nin a shopping centre to a company called Expectra 534 (Pty) Ltd. The\nwritten\nlease agreement contained a provision to the effect that the\ntenant was granted an option to purchase the leased premises plus an\nadditional area in the shopping centre, within two years, at a price\nof R2 million, subject to certain conditions. It was agreed\nthat this\nlease agreement was in provisional form and was to remain in force\npending the conclusion of a 'final agreement'. [49]\nIn February 2003\nthe 'final agreement' was signed, but, in the interim, it had been\nagreed that E and D Motors would be substituted\nas lessee (E and D\nMotors having the same directors and shareholders as Expectra 534\n(Pty) Ltd). The existence of the option was\nconfirmed in this lease\nagreement (this time the grant being in favour of E and D Motors) and\na plan of the shopping centre was annexed\nto the lease showing the\narea which was to be subject to the option (and which was\napproximately twice the size of the premises actually\nleased by E and\nD Motors). No reference was made in this version of the option to the\nconditions previously stipulated in the lease\nsigned by Expectra.\nShortly after this 'final lease' was concluded, Quantum sold the\nshopping centre to Spearhead. The contract of\nsale contained a\nreference to the existence of the option in terms which will be set\nout later. At some time shortly after transfer\nof the property to\nSpearhead, E and D Motors exercised the option in a signed letter\naddressed to Spearhead, tendering to pay the\npurchase price of R2\nmillion. After certain correspondence was exchanged, Spearhead\nadopted the stance that it was not obliged to\nhonour the option. E\nand D Motors then instituted the action for specific performance, ie\ntransfer of the property to them against\ntheir tender of payment.\n[48]\tIn the court below, Zondi J held that Spearhead had\npurchased the shopping centre with knowledge of the existence of the\noption\nin favour of E and D Motors. He placed emphasis on\ncorrespondence by Spearhead's attorney after E and D Motors'\npurported exercise\nof the option, in which it was stated that\nSpearhead was 'bound' by the exercise.\n39\nAs to the contention that there was no compliance with the\nformalities required for a valid alienation of immovable property,\nthe\nlearned judge held, as I understand his judgment, that the\nprinciple of\nhuur gaat voor koop\nhad\nthe effect,\nex lege\n,\nof substituting Spearhead for Quantum for all purposes of the lease\nagreement. These 'purposes' included the grant of the option\nand, I\npresume, the legal consequence of the substitution was that Spearhead\nwas to be regarded as the grantor of the option and\nQuantum's\nsignature of the lease was to be regarded as that of Spearhead once\nthe property had been transferred to Spearhead.\n40\nIf my interpretation of the findings of the court below is correct,\nthen I consider that the learned judge overstated the law as\nit\ncurrently stands with regard to the consequences of the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nprinciple.\n[49]\tIn argument before us, the primary contention by Mr\nMullins, for Spearhead, was that his client was not bound by the\noption to\npurchase. He submitted that the obligations in respect of\nthe option were not transferred to Spearhead when it took transfer of\nthe\nproperty pursuant to the sale. He further contended that no valid\n'deed of alienation', complying with the formalities prescribed\nby\nthe Alienation of Land Act 68 of 1981 ('the Act'), had come into\nbeing as a result of the cumulative transactions between the\nparties\nand that the claim for specific performance of a contract of sale by\nSpearhead to E and D Motors must accordingly fail. Mr\nvan Riet, for E\nand D Motors, based his claims to validity of the exercise of the\noption on two contentions. The first was that the\ntransfer of rights\nand obligations pursuant to the\nhuur gaat voor\nkoop\nrule occurred\nex\nlege\nand, as such, the substitution of\nSpearhead for Quantum was automatic. Accordingly, so the contention\nran, the option which had been\ngranted and signed by Quantum must be\ntreated as an option signed by Spearhead, so that the exercise by E\nand D Motors must, in law,\nbring into being a valid contract of sale\nby Spearhead to E and D Motors. Mr van Riet's\nsecond contention was that the written lease\nby Quantum to E and D Motors, which had been signed by both of them,\nand the contract\nof sale signed by Spearhead, obliged Spearhead to\nhonour the option if exercised by E and D Motors. The exercise of\nthis option by\nthe signature and transmission of the letter from E\nand D Motors to Spearhead, he contended, would in any event bring\ninto existence\na contract complying with the formalities prescribed\nby the Act.\n[50]\tTwo comparatively recent decisions by this court\nhave restated the basic principles upon which the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nrule is to operate. The first\nis\nMignoel Properties (Pty) Ltd v Kneebone\n1989 (4) SA 1042\n(A),\nin\nwhich Friedman AJA\nheld\nthat:\n41\n'. . . once the lessee elects to remain in the leased\npremises after a sale, the seller\nex lege\nfalls out of the picture and his place as lessor is taken by the\npurchaser. No new contract comes into existence; all that happens\nis\nthat the purchaser is substituted for the seller as lessor without\nthe necessity for a cession of rights or an assignment of\nobligations.\nOn being so substituted for the seller, the purchaser\nacquires all the rights which the seller had in terms of the lease,\nexcept,\nof course, collateral rights unconnected with the lease.'\nThe second decision is\nGenna-Wae\nProperties (Pty) Ltd v Medio-Tronics (Natal) (Pty) Ltd\n[1995] ZASCA 42\n;\n1995\n(2) SA 926\n(A) at 939, where Corbett CJ\nextended the principle stated in\nMignoel\nby confirming that the lessee does not have an election whether to\nproceed with the lease â he is bound, just as the purchaser\nis, to\nthe terms of the lease as they stood between him and the original\nlessor. Apart from this gloss, the decision in\nGenna-Wae\nendorsed the principle quoted above from\nMignoel\n.\n'Collateral rights unconnected with the lease.'\n[51]\tThe authors Cooper\n42\nand Kerr\n43\nsuggest that the question of what are 'collateral rights unconnected\nwith the lease' must be decided on a casuistic basis, dependent\nupon\nthe intention of the parties as gleaned from a consideration of the\ncontract as a whole (or possibly the contractual matrix,\nwhere more\nthan one contract is involved). Options to renew present no\ndifficulty. It has long been the position that such options,\nconstituting, as they do, obligations due by the landlord in his\ncapacity as such, are a fundamental part of the lease arrangement\nand\nshould not be regarded as 'collateral' or 'unconnected with the\nlease'.\n44\nIt is the authors' approach to options to purchase with which I have\ndifficulty. Stating that options to purchase 'present a more\ndifficult problem', Kerr\n45\nrefers to the decisions in\nGinsberg v Nefdt\n(1908) (25) SC 680\nand\nArchibald & Co Ltd\nv Strachan & Co Ltd\n1944 NPD 40\nas\nexamples (as I understand the learned author) of cases in which\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\noperated in favour of a lessee\nwho had an option to purchase and, accordingly, against the\nprospective purchaser. After then referring\nto the apparently\ncontrary decision by Ogilvie Thompson J in\nShalala v Gelb\nthe learned author states:\n'With The Hon Mr Justice Cooper it is thought that the\ncorrect approach is to enquire whether the option to purchase was an\nintegral\npart of the original lease or not; if it was, as for example\nwhere it was an inducement to contract, or its presence had a bearing\non the rent agreed upon, then it is protected by the rule\nhuur\ngaat voor koop;\nif it was not, as for example\nwhen it is clearly supplementary to the main agreement, then it is\nnot protected.'\nI very much doubt that the test thus proposed will\nassist in dealing with the difficulty.\n[52]\tIt must be borne in mind that the principle of\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\noperates in regard to the\npurchaser of leased property regardless of whether he has notice of\nthe existence or the terms of the prior\nlease.\n46\nThe object of the rule is an equitable one, namely to protect the\nright of the lessee to continued occupation of the property. It\nis\nperhaps not surprising that such a rule, which does not have its\norigins in one or other of the recognized principles of contract,\nshould give rise to vigorous debate about its effects and its\nlimits.\n47\nBut it can hardly be equitable to bind an innocent purchaser to an\noption to purchase which may well be for a price less than that\nwhich\nhe has just paid to acquire the property, simply because the option\nforms an 'integral part' of the lease to which he has succeeded.\nIn\nmy view, the problem must be approached from an objective point of\nview which keeps in focus the basic object of\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\n. On this approach, the\nquestion is simply whether the 'collateral right' (or the collateral\nobligation) relates to the lessee's real\nright of occupation\nas\nlessee\n. It seems to me that this question can\nhardly ever be answered in the affirmative when it relates to the\nrights and obligations flowing\nfrom an option to purchase. The\nguarded statement by Ogilvie Thompson J in\nShalala,\nto the effect that the maxim\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nhas no application as between\ncompetitors for dominium\n48\nhas been criticized by the writers to whom I have made reference\nearlier, but in my view it encapsulates a legal conclusion which\nfits\nvery comfortably into the scheme of application of the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nrule.\n[53]\tAn option to purchase incorporates a\npactum\nde contrahendo\nin which the grantor\nundertakes irrevocably to keep an offer to sell open, usually for a\nspecified or determinable period. The grant\nmay be subject to certain\ncontingencies and/or conditions.\n49\nThe rights conferred by it are purely personal to the grantee.\nAssuming that the option is granted in respect of the leased property\n(for, if it is not, then it can hardly be regarded as part of the\nlandlord's obligations to his tenant\n'as\nlessor'\n), then the anomalous situation arises\nthat, by selling to the purchaser, the landlord jeopardizes the\npactum\n. The common law\nin this situation (quite apart from the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nrule) is clear. If the\npurchaser had notice of the existence of the option prior to\npurchasing, he must be taken to have bought the\nproperty subject to\nthe lessee's personal right against the landlord to exercise it. If\nthe purchaser did not have notice of the\noption, there is no rule in\nthe common law (again apart from the possible application of\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\n) which would render the\npurchaser bound to an obligation of which he was unaware. The\nquestion is whether the development of the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nprinciple in our law has\nincluded, or should include, the\nex lege\ntransfer of obligations arising out of an\noption to purchase, granted by the original landlord,\nto the purchaser of leased property.\nCertainly, an examination of the reported decisions concerning\noptions to purchase in this context\ndoes not reveal any such\ndevelopment.\nThe Case Law on the Exercise of Options to Purchase\n.\n[54]\tThere are three reported cases in which the\nexercise of an option to purchase, granted to a lessee, occurred\nafter the original\nlandlord had sold the leased property.\n50\nThe first such decision is\nGinsberg v Nefdt\n(1908) 25 SC 680.\nThe\nlease in this matter included the grant to the lessee of an option to\npurchase the leased property. The landlord sold the property\nto a\nthird party during the currency of the lease. The lessee applied to\ninterdict the transfer of the property to the purchaser.\nThe\npurchaser agreed to be bound by the lessee's option but, for some\nreason which is not clear, the court granted the interdict\nto protect\nthe lessee's option. It appears that the option had not been\nexercised at the time when the matter came to court, nor\nis there any\nindication as to whether the option was to be exercised against the\noriginal landlord or the purchaser. Given that an\ninterdict against\nthe purchaser was granted, though, it seems that the parties\ncontemplated that the option was to be exercised against\nthe former.\n[55]\tThe second case is\nArchibald\n& Co Ltd v Strachan & Co Ltd\n1944 NPD\n40.\nInsofar as they\nrelate to the issues in this matter, the facts are briefly that the\nlandlord had granted the lessee an option to purchase\nthe leased\nproperty, such option being incorporated in the agreement of lease.\nThe landlord subsequently sold the property but, for\nreasons which\nare not recorded, transfer of the property was not passed to the\npurchaser. Nearly 18 months after the conclusion of\nthe contract of\nsale, the lessee exercised his option by directing a written\nacceptance of it to the original landlord. The landlord\nthereupon\nnotified the purchaser that the sale to him had 'fallen away' by\nvirtue of the lessee's decision to exercise the option.\nThe purchaser\nsought an order of specific performance against the landlord but his\napplication was dismissed. The court held that\nthe purchaser had\nconcluded the contract of sale in the full knowledge of the existence\nof the option and was accordingly bound to\nrecognize the lessee's\nentitlement to exercise it. Here again, the lessee had exercised the\noption against the original landlord\nand not against the purchaser.\n[56]\tIn\nVan der Pol v Symington\n1971 (4) 472 (T), the original lessor (who had granted the lessee an\noption to purchase) had died during the currency of the lease\nand the\nproperty was transferred to her son by her executor. The lessee\nexercised the option against the son. The court held that\nthe son was\nbound by the option, regardless of whether he had knowledge of the\nlease before he took transfer, on the basis that he\nwas a gratuitous\nsuccessor to the original lessor. The question whether, by exercising\nthe option, the lessee had brought into being\na written contract\nbetween himself and the son was not considered. Nor was this an\napplication of the principle of\nhuur gaat voor\nkoop\nbecause the son had not purchased the\nproperty but had acquired his title as an heir.\n51\n[57]\tA significant feature of both\nGinsberg\nand\nArchibald\nis\nthat the option was exercised against the grantor and not the\npurchaser and the court, in each case, applied the doctrine of notice\nas the basis for finding that the prior right of the lessee under his\noption prevailed over the subsequent right of the purchaser\nto\ntransfer of the property.\n52\nNor, in either of the two cases, had there been transfer to the\npurchaser, and although there was a passing reference in\nGinsberg\nto the 'well known proposition . . . that\nlease goes before sale', the court appeared to be applying the\nprinciples of a 'double sale',\nand not\nhuur\ngaat voor koop.\nThe result is that there is no\nreported decision in our case law to the effect that the obligations\narising out of an option to purchase\nare transferred\nex\nlege\nand without express or tacit assignment,\nto the purchaser of leased property. Nor, on the basis of what I have\nset out above, is\nthere any reason to extend the effects of the\nhuur\ngaat voor koop\nrule to include such a\ntransfer.\n[58]\tI have already indicated that such an extension\nwould operate unfairly against an 'innocent purchaser' (ie one who\npurchases\nthe leased property in ignorance of the terms of the\nagreement between the landlord and the tenant). As to the 'purchaser\nwith notice',\nthe doctrine of notice, in my view, provides adequate\nprotection to the tenant in respect of his rights in terms of the\noption, as\nis apparent from the decisions referred to in para 57,\nabove. The situation of the tenant who invokes the doctrine of notice\nagainst\na purchaser of the leased property in these circumstances has\nrecently been clarified by this court in\nBowring\nNO v Vrededorp Properties CC\n2007 (5) SA 391\n(SCA), particularly in paras 17 and 18. In that case the respondent\nhad purchased a portion of a property on the basis that the portion\nwas to be subdivided and transferred to the respondent together with\nthe registration of a servitude which was to give the respondent\naccess to the subdivision. Before transfer or registration of the\nservitude, the owner of the property had been liquidated. The\nliquidator\nsold the whole property to Investec Bank, the contract of\nsale making express reference to the uncompleted sale to the\nrespondent\nand specifically recording that the property being sold\ndid not include the portion sold to the respondent. Investec Bank\nlater sold\nthe whole property to the appellant. The contract between\nInvestec Bank and the appellant made no mention of the prior sale of\nportion\nof the property to the respondent, but it was common cause\nthat the appellant was aware of the respondent's right to claim\ntransfer\nof, and have the servitude registered in favour of, the\nportion of the property.\n[59]\tThe respondent had sued the appellant for transfer\nof the portion of the property to it and for an order that the\nappellant do\nwhatever was necessary to register the servitude over\nthe remainder of the property in favour of the respondent. The\nappellant had\ncontended that the respondent had no right to claim\ntransfer from it, but that the doctrine of notice required the\nrespondent first\nto set aside the sale to the appellant and then to\nclaim transfer from Investec Bank. This defence had failed in the\ncourt of first\ninstance, nor did it succeed before this court. After\na careful examination of the consequences of 'double sales' to\npurchasers with\nnotice, Brand JA said:\n53\n'(I)n the case of a servitude, application of the\ndoctrine of notice does not require that the transfer of the property\nto the purchaser\nbe set aside so as to enable the beneficiary under\nthe servitude agreement first to claim registration of the servitude\nagainst the\nseller before the property is retransferred to the\npurchaser subject to the registered servitude. The beneficiary's\nclaim is allowed\ndirectly against the purchaser (see eg\nGrant\nand Another v Stonestreet and Others\n54\n(supra)\n7). That there is no privity of\ncontract between the beneficiary and the purchaser is not seen as an\ninsurmountable hurdle. Why then,\nit may in my view rightfully be\nasked, should the position be any different when the same doctrine is\napplied in the instance of\ndouble sales?\nMy suggestion is not that in the successive-purchaser\nsituation B (the first buyer) should always be allowed to claim\ntransfer directly\nfrom C (the second). The doctrine of notice is an\nequitable remedy and its manner of application should be determined\nlargely by\nwhat is considered to be equitable to all concerned in the\ncircumstances of the particular case. Where the whole property is\nfirst\nsold to B and then to C, the most equitable solution will\nprobably be to restore A and C to their former position â by\nordering\ncancellation of the transfer and repayment of the purchase\nprice â before A is ordered to transfer the property to B. But in\nthis\ncase the position is substantially different. (The respondent)\nclaims transfer of . . . portion of the railway siding only.\nCancellation\nof the successive transfers of the whole property to\nInvestec and the (appellant) will therefore require that the\nremainder of the\nproperty be retransferred first to Investec and then\nto the (appellant). . . . No reason has been suggested, and I can\nthink of none,\nwhy this cumbersome and wasteful process would be in\nanybody's interest.'\n[60]\tIt seems to me that, in general, the equitable\nprocess of rearrangement contemplated in this judgment will be\napplicable to a\nsituation where a lessee seeks to enforce his right\nto delivery pursuant to the exercise of his option against the\noriginal lessor,\nregardless of whether the option related to the\nwhole of the property sold or to only a portion of it. The fact is\nthat there is\nno 'equitable need' to postulate an\nex\nlege\ntransfer of the obligations arising out\nof the option to the purchaser in order to protect the lessee's\noption against a purchaser\nwith notice.\n[61]\tI conclude, therefore, that the obligations arising\nfrom an option to purchase the leased property, granted by the\nlessor, are\nnot, by the operation of the rule\nhuur\ngaat voor koop,\ntransferred\nex\nlege\nto the purchaser of the property. It\nfollows that a lessee, seeking to exercise such an option (always\nassuming, of course, that\nthe relevant contracts do not constitute an\nassignment of the lessor's obligations to the purchaser) must do so\nas against the grantor\nand not against the purchaser. Where, however,\nthere has been a transfer of the property to a purchaser with notice\nof the option,\nthe lessee, having thus exercised his option, will\ngenerally be able to claim transfer of the property from the\npurchaser. The submissions\non behalf of E and D Motors to the effect\nthat it was entitled to exercise the option against Spearhead merely\nby operation of the\nhuur gaat voor koop\nrule\nmust, in my view, fail.\n[62]\tThat leaves the contention by the respondent that\nthe lease, the contract of sale to Spearhead and the letter from E\nand D Motors\nto Spearhead purporting to exercise the option, read\ntogether, constitute a written deed of alienation complying with the\nprovisions\nof the\nAlienation of Land Act 68 of 1981\n. There is no\ndoubt that the grant of the option in the written lease by Quantum to\nE and D Motors constituted an offer to sell complying\nwith the\nrequisite formalities.\n55\nThe fact that the written offer and the written acceptance may be\nembodied in different documents is not a bar to compliance with\nthe\nAct.\n56\nThe question is whether the agreement of sale from Quantum to\nSpearhead can be construed as an assignment of Quantum's obligations\nin terms of the option to Spearhead, complying with the statutory\nformalities. The only mention, in the contract of sale, of the\noption\ngranted to E and D Motors is to be found in clause 6.4, which reads:\n'6.4\tThe Seller warrants and undertakes to the Purchaser\nâ\n6.4.1\tthe Seller is the owner of and has the absolute\nright to dispose of the property to the Purchaser in accordance with\nthe provisions\nof this agreement;\n6.4.2\tno agreements have been entered into by the Seller\nwhereby any restrictive conditions or servitudes or other real rights\nattach\nto the property or in terms of which any person, natural or\ncorporate, is entitled to obtain any real rights to the property,\nsave\nfor the existing tenant, Ottery Toyota,\n57\nwho have limited rights to purchase their section subject to a\nsubdivision of the land;\n6.4.3\tno notice has been received by the Seller of the\nintention of any authority to expropriate the property or any portion\nthereof\nnor is the Seller aware of any intention to expropriate the\nproperty or any portion thereof by any such authority;\n6.4.4\tas far as the Seller is aware the current use of\nthe property and buildings by the existing tenants is lawful and is\nnot in\ncontravention of any applicable zoning scheme and/or\nconditions of title;\n6.4.5\tas far as the seller is aware no building\nencroaches over any boundary or building line or similar restriction;\n6.4.6\tas far as the Seller is aware no building or\nimprovement on any adjoining property encroaches onto the property.'\n[63]\tI have purposely quoted the clause in full to set\nclause 6.4.2 in its context. I do not think that the clause can, by\nthe furthest\nstretch of imaginative interpretation, be construed as\nan assignment by Quantum to Spearhead of any obligations, let alone\nthe obligations\narising out of the option. Nor is it couched as an\noffer by Spearhead to endorse the option in favour of E and D Motors.\nWhat the\nseller is saying in this clause is plainly along the\nfollowing lines: 'Take notice that there is an option which entitles\nOttery\nToyota to purchase a portion of the property if the land is\nappropriately subdivided'. The sale of the subdivision to E and D\nMotors\nwould not be frustrated by the fact that Quantum was no longer\nthe owner and, indeed, the tenor of the stipulation is simply that,\nif the option is exercised (against Quantum), Spearhead may later be\nrequired  to transfer the subdivision to E and D Motors. It\nis a\nclassic situation where the doctrine of notice would apply. But that,\nto my mind, is as far as the clause can be taken.\n[64]\tIt follows that, in my view, the appeal should\nsucceed. The following order is made:\n1\tThe appeal is allowed with costs, such costs to\ninclude the costs of two counsel.\n2\tThe order of the court below is set aside and the\nfollowing order substituted therefor:\n'The plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs, such\ncosts to include the costs of two counsel.'\n________________________\nNV HURT\nACTING\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances:\nFor Appellant:\tS Mullins SC\nA D Brown\nInstructed by\nBernadt Vukic Potash & Getz; Cape Town\nLovius Block, Bloemfontein\nFor Respondent:\tR S Van Riet SC\nInstructed by\nHarmse Kriel Inc; Cape Town\nRossouws Attorneys, Bloemfontein\n1\nSection 2(1) of the Act provides: âNo\n\talienation of land after the commencement of this section shall,\n\tsubject to the provisions\nof section 28, be of any force or effect\n\tunless it is contained in a deed of alienation signed by the parties\n\tthereto or by their\nagents acting on their written authority.â\n2\nSome of the issues argued in the court below and raised in the\n\tappellantâs heads of argument in this court as grounds of appeal\n\twere correctly abandoned at the commencement of argument before us.\n3\nScrooby v Gordon & Co\n1904 TS 937\n;\nBoshoff\n\tv Theron\n1940 TPD 299\n;\nArchibald v Strachan\n1944 NPD 40\n;\n\tJ C De Wet ââHuur gaat voor koopâ and the Proviso to Section 2\n\tof the General Law Amendment Act, No 50 of 1956â\n(1970) 87\nSALJ\n137\n;\nJ C\nDe Wet\n(1944) 8\nTHRHR\n74\n;\n\tW E Cooper â\nLandlord And Tenantâ\n2 ed p 274; A J Kerr\n\tâ\nThe Law of Sale and Lease\nâ (1984) p 277;\nDe Jager v\n\tSisana\n1930 AD 71\n;\nDe Wet v Union Government\n1934 AD 59\n;\nThipa v Subramany\n1954 (4) SA 126\n(N);\nKessoopersadh en `n\n\tander v Essop en ân ander\n1970 (1) SA 265\n(A);\nMignoel\n\tProperties (Pty) Ltd v Kneebone\n1989 (4) SA 1042\n(A);\nGennae-Wae\n\tProperties (Pty) Ltd v Medio-Tronics (Natal) (Pty) Ltd\n[1995] ZASCA 42\n;\n1995 (2)\n\tSA 926\n(A).\n4\nGraham v Local & Overseas Investments (Pty) Ltd\n1942 AD\n\t95.\n5\nSee also 14\nLAWSA\n2\n\ted para 45.\n6\nAt 1050J-1051A.\n7\n[1995] ZASCA 42\n;\n1995 (2) SA 926\n(A) at 937B.\n8\n2006 (1) SA 197\n(SCA)  para 7.\n9\nLandlord and Tenant\n2ed (1994) at 300-302.\n10\nThe Law of Sale and Lease\n3ed (2004)\nat 42.\n11\nBanket Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Levy\n1955 (4) SA 74\n(SR) at 76;\nUys and\n\tanother v Sam Friedman Ltd\n1935 AD 165\nat 166\n.\n12\nScrooby v Gordon & Co\n(supra)\n\tat 945;\nDe Jager v Sisana\n(supra)\nat 82;\nDe\n\tWet v Union Government\n(supra) at 63;\nKessoopersadh v Essop\n(supra) at\n\t282-3;\nCreeser v Smit\n1948 (4) SA 302\n(T);\nBoshoff v Theron\n(supra) at 305.\n13\n1950 (1) SA 851\n(C) at 865.\n14\n1983 (4) SA 1\n(T).\n15\n(8)\n1944\nTHRHR\n74\n; De Wet & Van Wyk\nDie\n\tSuid-Afrikaanse Kontraktereg en Handelsreg\n4ed\n\t(1978).\n16\nLandlord and Tenant\n2ed (1994) at 302.\n17\nAt 1049B-F.\n18\n1970 (1) SA 265\n(A) at 283B-C.\n19\n1950 (1) SA 851\n(C).\n20\nAt 862.\n21\nAt 864.\n22\n14 LAWSA 2ed para 55.\n23\n1984 (1) SA 121\n(A) at 126D-G.\n24\n1955 (4) SA 74\n(SR).\n25\n1935 AD 165\nat 166.\n26\nAt 166.

Authors such as W E Cooper\nLandlord\n\tand Tenant\n2ed (1994) pp 297 â 300; A S\n\tMathews 1966\nAnnual Survey\n116, De Wet (whose views relating to the scope of the maxim, have\n\tnevertheless, since been dismissed by this court as indicated)\n(1944) 8\nTHRHR\n241\nhave, for a variety of reasons, criticized the view. The reasons\n\tinclude that it may be difficult to determine which terms are\n\tmaterial or non-material and that as the lessorâs substitute, the\n\tnew owner should be bound by all the terms of the contract.\nI do not\n\tpropose to engage in the debate as none of these concerns arise in\n\tthe present case.\n35\nI deal more fully with the fate of the disputed\n\tconditions hereinbelow.\n36\nSee, for example,\nRobinson v Randfontein\n\tEstates GM Co Ltd\n1925 AD 173\nat 178.\n37\nImprefed (Pty) Ltd v National Transport\n\tCommission\n1993 (3) SA 94\n(A) at\n\t107G-H\n.\n38\nCollen v Rietfontein Engineering Works\n1948\n\t(1) SA 413\n(A);\nMiddleton v Carr\n1949\n\t(2) SA 374\n(A);\nShill v Milner\n1937\n\tAD 101.\n39\nIt should be noted that the attorney was not authorized in writing\n\tto write this letter to E and D Motors.\n40\nThis is my interpretation of the learned judge's approach from the\n\tfollowing passage in para 39 of his judgment, in which he dealt\nwith\n\tthe contention that there was no compliance with the statutory\n\tformalities: 'The option agreement in the present matter was\n\ttransferred by virtue of the principle\nhuur gaat voor koop\nfrom Quantum Leap to the defendant [Spearhead] which entitled the\n\tplaintiff [E and D Motors] to exercise its rights as against\nthe\n\tdefendant directly. The option which the plaintiff seeks to exercise\n\tis contained in the lease agreement which it concluded\nwith Quantum\n\tLeap. In other words the defendant was substituted\nex lege\nfor Quantum Leap (the original lessor) and the latter fell out of\n\tthe picture. On being substituted the defendant acquired by\n\noperation of law all the rights and obligations of Quantum Leap\n\tunder the lease.'\n41\nAt 1050I â 1051A.\n42\nLandlord and Tenant\n(2 ed) p 303.\n43\nThe Law of Sale and Lease\n(3 ed) p 442 and also writing in 14\n\t(2) Lawsa (2\nnd\nreissue) para 46.\n44\nShalala & another v Gelb\n1950 (1) SA 851\n(C) at 856 to\n\t864.\n45\nOp cit\npp 441 â 442.\n46\nShalala at\n862.\n47\nSee\nKessoopersadh v Essop\n1970 (1) SA 265\n(A) at 282 â 283.\n48\nAt 865.\n49\nHirschowitz v Moolman\n1985 (3) 739 (A) at 765 â 766.\n50\nThese are, as far as I have been able to ascertain, the only three\n\tcases in which this aspect has been dealt with.\n51\nThere is one other decision in which an option to purchase leased\n\tproperty was considered in this particular context, namely\nShalala\n\tv Gelb\n1950 (1) SA 851\n(C)\nat p 862.

    "facts": "Quantum Leap Investments (Quantum) entered into an offer to lease with Expectra 534 (Pty) Ltd in October 2002, which contained a 24‑month option to purchase the premises for R2,000,000 subject to certain approvals. The parties substituted Expectra with E & D Motors (the respondent) in a final lease signed in November 2002, and the respondent occupied the premises in February 2003. In February 2003 Quantum sold the shopping centre to Spearhead Property Holdings Ltd (the appellant). The respondent later attempted to exercise the purchase option, but the appellant contended that the option was not binding on it. The lower court ordered the appellant to obtain subdivision approval and dismissed the respondent’s claim, leading to an appeal on the enforceability of the option and whether the lease should be rectified.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the option to purchase granted in the lease binds the purchaser of the property (Spearhead) by virtue of the rule huur gaat voor koop or any other legal basis. 2. Whether the respondent’s purported exercise of the option created a valid contract of sale in compliance with the Alienation of Land Act. 3. Whether the lease agreement should be rectified to insert the omitted conditions that were present in the original offer to lease.",
    "principles": "The court considered the equitable maxim huur gaat voor koop, which substitutes the purchaser for the seller as landlord and transfers the lease’s obligations, except for collateral rights unconnected with the lease. Relevant authorities included Mignoel Properties (ex‑lege substitution of the lessor), Genna‑Wae Properties (binding effect of lease terms on purchaser), and scholarly commentary on when an option is an integral part of a lease. The Alienation of Land Act s 2(1) requires a written deed of alienation signed by the parties for a sale to be effective. The court also examined the doctrine of notice and the distinction between options to renew (generally integral) and options to purchase (often regarded as collateral).",
    "application": "Maya JA, dissenting, argued that the option was integral to the lease and therefore bound the appellant, relying on clause 6.4.2 of the sale agreement as satisfying s 2(1) of the Act and on the intention that the option influenced the rent. Hurt AJA, delivering the majority judgment, held that the option was a collateral right not transferred ex lege under huur gaat voor koop. The purchaser was not bound by the option absent a specific assignment, and the doctrine of notice did not create a deed of sale. Consequently, the respondent’s exercise did not create a valid contract of sale, and the claim for rectification was dismissed as the alleged omission was not proven to be a common error requiring correction.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was allowed. The option to purchase was not binding on Spearhead Property Holdings Ltd, and the respondent’s claim for specific performance was dismissed. The counterclaim for rectification of the lease was also dismissed. Costs were awarded to each party, including the costs of two counsel."
