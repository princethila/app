On\r\n22 November 2005 the appellant was convicted on counts one and two on\r\nthe basis that he\nhad been an accomplice in the unlawful importation\r\nand subsequent sale of elephant tusks by Esterhuizen to one Jaco\r\nOberholzer\n(Oberholzer) in contravention of ss 44(1)(b)(i)\n1\nand 46\n2\nof the Ordinance.\n[2]\tOn appeal to the Northern Cape High Court, the\r\nconviction and sentence on count 1 were set aside. The conviction on\r\ncount 2\nwas confirmed but the sentence was set aside and replaced\r\nwith a fine of R5 000,00 (five-thousand rand) or imprisonment for\r\nnine\nmonths with a further imprisonment for nine months suspended for\r\n3 years on prescribed conditions. The appellant is appealing against\n\nthat judgment with the leave of the court below.\n[3]\tThe facts of this case are common cause. During or\r\nabout December 1998, the South African Police Services (SAPS)\r\nlaunched a\nspecial covert operation dubbed 'Operation Rhino' in\r\nUpington. This was in direct response to reports of some widespread\r\ncriminal\nactivities in Upington involving unlawful dealing in uncut\r\ndiamonds and unlawful dealing in protected species. In the course of\n\ntheir initial investigations, some twenty-six suspects, including the\r\nappellant were identified.\n[4]\tThe required authority to undertake the covert\r\noperation in terms of s 252A of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\r\n(the CPA)\nwas obtained from the office of the Director of Public\r\nProsecutions (DPP) in Kimberley. Jaco Oberholzer (Oberholzer), a\r\nmember\nof the Gold and Diamond Unit, Bloemfontein was to be used as\r\nthe undercover agent. In order to facilitate this covert operation\n\nOberholzer was employed by one Nickey Celliers, also one of the\r\npolice informers involved in 'Operation Rhino', at Celliers' business\n\ncalled North Western Transport in Upington. The authority thus\r\nconferred included the interception and recording of communications\n\nbetween the police, the undercover agent and the suspects.\n[5]\tIt appears that, during the period between December\r\n1998 and January 1999, Oberholzer's credibility in the role he was\r\nplaying\nbegan to be questioned. This posed a serious threat to the\r\nentire covert operation. In order to save the project the police\r\ndecided\nto clothe Oberholzer with more convincing credibility. They\r\ndecided to stage a bogus arrest of Oberholzer for unlawful dealing in\n\nuncut diamonds. The necessary authority for this bogus arrest was\r\ngranted by the office of the DPP in Kimberley.\n[6]\tPursuant to this ploy, Oberholzer was duly arrested\r\non 25 February 1999 for unlawful dealing in uncut diamonds. It was\r\npart\nof the scheme that Oberholzer would contact the appellant for\r\nlegal representation. This Oberholzer did but, as the appellant had\na\r\nprior engagement on the date set for Oberholzer's court appearance\r\nthe appellant instructed one, Mr de Beer, his professional\nassistant\r\nto attend to the bail application, which de Beer did successfully. It\r\nwas an essential part of the plot that Oberholzer\nshould use this\r\narrest to establish and maintain a relationship with the appellant.\r\nIt was in the course of the relationship which\nensued that the\r\nappellant told Oberholzer that he knew of someone from Rietfontein\r\nwho had elephant tusks to sell. He offered to\nintroduce Oberholzer to\r\nthat person. In pursuance of this offer the appellant called\r\nOberholzer to his offices on 29 March 1999\nto meet the man from\r\nRietfontein who turned out to be Esterhuizen (who later became\r\naccused two). The appellant introduced Esterhuizen\nto Oberholzer at\r\nhis offices. As a direct consequence of this introduction,\r\nEsterhuizen sold and delivered two elephant tusks to\nOberholzer. In a\r\nrecorded conversation on 1 April 1999, the transcript whereof was\r\nhanded in as 'Exh K,' Oberholzer reported to\nappellant that a sale\r\nwas successfully concluded for R20 500,00.\n[7]\tIn terms of\ns 252A\nof the\nCriminal Procedure\nAct 51 of 1977\nany law enforcement officer, official of the State or\r\nany other person authorised thereto for such purpose may make use of\r\na trap\nor engage in an undercover operation in order to detect,\r\ninvestigate or uncover the commission of an offence, or to prevent\r\nthe\ncommission of any offence, and the evidence so obtained shall be\r\nadmissible if that conduct does not go beyond providing an\r\nopportunity\nto commit an offence. The appellant conceded that the\r\nconduct of the police in this case did not go beyond providing an\r\nopportunity\nto commit an offence. It follows that the evidence\r\nagainst the appellant was not rendered inadmissible by virtue of the\r\nfact that\nit was obtained by way of a trap. Before us the appellant\r\naccepted that to be the case.\n[8]\tIn the court below the appellant contended that the\r\nevidence against him was rendered inadmissible by s 35(5) of the\r\nConstitution.\nThe section provides:\nâ\nEvidence obtained in a manner that violates any right\r\nin the Bill of Rights must be excluded if the admission of that\r\nevidence would\nrender the trial unfair or would otherwise be\r\ndetrimental to the administration of justice.â\nThe court below held that the section did not render the\r\nevidence against the appellant inadmissible as the admission of such\r\nevidence\nwould not have rendered the trial unfair. Before us the\r\nappellant conceded that the section did not apply as no right in the\r\nBill\nof Rights was violated. The appellant did however submit that\r\nthe evidence against him should not have been admitted in that it\nwas\r\nobtained in an improper manner in that the magistrates and the\r\nprosecutor concerned were misled and the judicial process was\nabused\r\nby police officers in cooperation with senior officials of the\r\nNational Prosecuting Authority in order to create an opportunity\nfor\r\nOberholzer to make contact with the appellant so as to uncover the\r\ncommission of an offence.\n[9]\tThe respondent conceded that the investigative\r\nmethods employed by the police were unacceptable and that a court had\r\na discretion\nto disallow evidence improperly obtained but submitted\r\nthat the facts relied upon by the appellant did not justify the\r\nexclusion\nof the evidence.\n[10]\tIn\nS v M\n2002 (2) SACR 411\n(SCA) at 431g-i Heher JA said that there is no\r\ndoubt that a court at common law has a discretion to exclude evidence\r\nimproperly\nobtained on the basis of âa proper balancing of the\r\ncompeting interests so clearly identifiedâ in\nS\r\nv Hammer and Others\n1994 (2) SACR 496\n(C). In\r\nthat case Farlam J said at 499a-e:\nâ\nThe following factors may be useful in deciding\r\nwhether to exercise the discretion: (a) societyâs right to insist\r\nthat those who\nenforce the law themselves respect it, so that a\r\ncitizenâs precious right to immunity from arbitrary and unlawful\r\nintrusion into\nthe daily affairs of private life may remain\r\nunimpaired; (b) whether the unlawful act was a mistaken act and\r\nwhether in the case\nof mistake, the cogency of evidence is affected;\r\n(c) the ease with which the law might have been complied with in\r\nprocuring the\nevidence in question (a deliberate âcutting of\r\ncornersâ would tend towards the inadmissibility of the evidence\r\nillegally obtained);\n(d) the nature of the offence charged and the\r\npolicy decision behind the enactment of the offence are also\r\nconsiderations; (e)\nunfairness to the accused should not be the only\r\nbasis for the exercise of the discretion; (f) whether the\r\nadministration of justice\nwould be brought into disrepute if the\r\nevidence was admitted; (g) there should be no presumption in favour\r\nof or against the reception\nof the evidence, the question of an onus\r\nshould not be introduced; (h) it should not be a direct intention to\r\ndiscipline the law\nenforcement officials; (i) an untrammelled search\r\nfor the truth should be balanced by discretionary measures, for in\r\nthe words\nof Knight Bruce VC, âTruth, like other good things, may\r\nbe loved unwisely â it may be pursued too keenly â may cost too\r\nmuchâ.â\n[11]\tIn the present case the police or prosecuting\r\nauthorities did not perform an unlawful act as against the appellant.\r\nInsofar\nas their conduct was improper it was improper as against the\r\ncourt, the magistrates and the prosecutors involved. Counsel for the\n\nappellant correctly conceded that the appellantâs rights had not\r\nbeen violated by such improper conduct. In so far as the appellant\n\nwas concerned, a misrepresentation was made to him that Oberholzer\r\nhad been dealing in uncut diamonds and that misrepresentation\n\neventually led to him introducing Oberholzer to Esterhuizen as a\r\nperson who had elephant tusks for sale. Traps, by their very nature\n\nalways involve misrepresentations specifically intended to deceive\r\nthe suspect. In terms of s 252A the uncovering of an offence\nby\r\nway of such a misrepresentation is not improper and if it goes no\r\nfurther than to create an opportunity to commit an offence\ndoes not\r\naffect the admissibility of the evidence obtained as a result. Save\r\nfor the limited purpose of persuading the appellant\nthat Oberholzer\r\nmight be inclined to unlawful acts, the misleading of the court, the\r\nmagistrates and the prosecutors had no effect\non the trial. The\r\nappellant can therefore not complain that he did not have a fair\r\ntrial. In these circumstances the admission\nof the evidence could not\r\nhave brought the administration of justice into disrepute. To the\r\ncontrary the exclusion of the evidence\ncould have done so. The\r\nappellant is an attorney who was suspected of criminal activities\r\nwhich the police had great difficulty\nin exposing. In these\r\ncircumstances the evidence against the appellant obtained as\r\naforesaid was in my view correctly admitted\nagainst the appellant.\n[12]\tThe appellant did not advance any other basis for\r\nupholding the appeal. The appeal is therefore dismissed.\n______________________\nL O BOSIELO\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFOR APPELLANT: \t\tF VAN ZYL SC\nInstructed by\nENGELSMAN, MAGABANE INC KIMBERLEY\nLOVIUS BLOCK ATTORNEYS BLOEMFONTEIN\nFOR RESPONDENT:\t\tJ J CLOETE\nInstructed by\nNATIONAL PROSECUTION AUTHORITY KIMBERLEY\nDIRECTOR PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS BLOEMFONTEIN\n1\n'\r\n\ts 44(1)(b)(i) Subject to the provisions of this ordinance, no person\r\n\tshall without a permit authorising him to do so-\n(a) \t. . . .\n(b)(i) \timport into the Province from any place outside the Republic\r\n\tthe carcass of any wild animal, or . . .'\n2\n's 46\tNo carcass of any wild animal shall be sold\r\n\tby any person other than-\n(a)\tthe owner of any land on which the animal concerned was hunted\r\n\tin accordance with the provisions of this ordinance;\n(b)\ta market master at a public or municipal market; or\n(c)\ta person authorised by a permit issued under this ordinance or a\r\n\tlicence issued under the Licences Ordinance, 1981(Ordinance\n17 of\r\n\t1981), to sell such carcass.'",

    "facts": "In December 1998 the South African Police Services launched \"Operation Rhino\" in Upington to investigate illegal diamond and protected‑species trade. Herman Zürich, an attorney, and 25 other suspects were identified. The police obtained authority under s 252A of the Criminal Procedure Act to conduct a covert operation, using undercover officer Jaco Oberholzer. To bolster Oberholzer’s credibility, the police staged a bogus arrest for uncut diamond dealing on 25 February 1999. Oberholzer, after being released on bail by Zürich’s assistant, approached Zürich for legal representation. Zürich introduced Oberholzer to Jacques Andrew Esterhuizen, who sold two elephant tusks to Oberholzer. The sale was recorded and formed the basis of Zürich’s conviction for contravening the Northern Cape Nature and Environmental Conservation Ordinance.",
    "issues": "The central issues were: (1) Whether evidence obtained from the police’s deceptive trap and the bogus arrest should be excluded under s 35(5) of the Constitution; (2) Whether the conduct of the police amounted to an unlawful act that would render the evidence inadmissible under s 252A of the Criminal Procedure Act; and (3) Whether the trial was rendered unfair by the manner in which the evidence was obtained.",
    "principles": "The Court considered s 252A CPA, which permits traps and undercover operations provided they do not go beyond creating an opportunity to commit an offence. It also examined s 35(5) of the Constitution, which requires exclusion of evidence if its admission would make the trial unfair or damage the administration of justice. The Court relied on S v M and S v Hammer for the common‑law discretion to exclude improperly obtained evidence, outlining factors such as societal interest in lawful enforcement, the nature of the misconduct, and the impact on the administration of justice.",
    "application": "The Court found that the police’s conduct, although deceptive, was authorised under s 252A and did not constitute an unlawful act against Zürich; the misrepresentations were intrinsic to the trap and did not infringe any constitutional right of the accused. Consequently, s 35(5) did not apply because no Bill of Rights violation occurred. Applying the discretionary factors, the Court concluded that excluding the evidence would not better serve justice and that admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Therefore, the evidence was admissible and the conviction on count 2 stood, with the sentence modified to a fine or imprisonment.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The conviction on count 2 for unlawful importation of elephant tusks was upheld, the sentence was replaced by a fine of R5 000 or imprisonment of nine months (with nine months suspended), and the conviction on count 1 was set aside."
