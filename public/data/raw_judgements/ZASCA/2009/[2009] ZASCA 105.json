The marriage\nwas out of community of property with\r\nthe exclusion of the accrual system as contemplated in Chapter 1 of\r\nthe\nMatrimonial Property Act 88 of 1984\n.\n[3]\tApproximately three and a half\r\nyears later they were divorced by order of the Pretoria High Court\r\n(Hartzenberg J). The divorce\norder was granted after a trial lasting\r\na week. The respondent had no capital claim against her former\r\nhusband and had restricted\nher claim to one for rehabilitative\r\nmaintenance. The relevant part of the order reads as follows:\nâ â\n2.\tTHAT the\r\nPlaintiff is to pay rehabilitative maintenance to the Defendant as\r\nfollows:\n2.1\tR8 000-00 per month\r\nfor the months of October, November and December 2003;\n2.2\tR6 000-00 per month\r\nfor the next 57 months;\n2.3\tAll payments are to\r\nbe paid on or before the 3\nrd\nday of each month;\n2.4\tIf the Defendant\r\nbecomes employed and earns an income, the Plaintiff will not be\r\n\t\tentitled to advance that income as changed\ncircumstances for\r\npurposes of an \t\t\talteration of the maintenance order.â â\n[4]\tSubsequent to the divorce\r\nproceedings and the order referred to above, Mr Kruger, to whom\r\nI shall hereafter refer as the\ndeceased, duly and punctually paid\r\nrehabilitative maintenance to the first respondent until 31 August\r\n2006. He passed away on 29 September\n2006 due to natural causes.\r\nBy this time the deceased had paid 33 of the envisaged 57 monthly\r\ninstalments.\n[5]\tOn 13 February 2007 the\r\ndeceasedâs son, Mr Fred Kruger, was appointed executor of the\r\nlatterâs estate. The first respondent\nlodged a claim against the\r\ndeceasedâs estate for the remainder of the rehabilitative\r\nmaintenance, which she considered due to\nher. This amounted to R144\r\n000, which was calculated as follows: 24 months x R6 000. The\r\nexecutor, after taking legal advice,\nrejected the claim.\n[6]\tNot surprisingly, this led to the\r\nlitigation culminating in the present appeal. During March 2008 the\r\nfirst respondent launched\napplication proceedings in the Pretoria\r\nHigh Court against Mr Kruger, in his capacity as executor of the\r\ndeceasedâs estate. She\nsought an order declaring that the estate\r\nwas liable to pay her rehabilitative maintenance. More specifically,\r\nshe sought an order\nfor payment of the amount of R144 000, with\r\ninterest\na tempore morae\n.\n[7]\tAs fate would have it the matter\r\nonce again came before Hartzenberg J, who granted the relief sought\r\nby the first respondent\nand ordered the executor, the appellant\r\nherein, to pay her costs.\n[8]\tIt is against that order, with the\r\nleave of the court below, that the present appeal is directed.\nConclusions\n[9]\nSection 7\nof the\nDivorce Act 70 of\n1979\nprovides for the division of assets and the maintenance of\r\nparties. The relevant part of\ns 7(2)\nprovides that a court, in the\r\nabsence of an agreement, may, âhaving regard to the existing or\r\nprospective means of each of the\nparties, their respective earning\r\ncapacities, financial needs and obligations, the age of each of the\r\nparties, the duration of\nthe marriage, the standard of living of the\r\nparties prior to the divorce, their conduct in so far as it may be\r\nrelevant to the\nbreak-down of the marriage, â¦ and any other factor\r\nwhich in the opinion of the court should be taken into account, make\r\nan order\nwhich the court finds just in respect of the payment of\r\nmaintenance by the one party to the other for any period until the\ndeath or remarriage of the\r\nparty in whose favour the order is given, whichever event may first\r\noccur\n.â (My emphasis).\n[10]\tAs can be seen, the power to\r\ngrant maintenance is confined not to the duration of the life of the\r\nspouse liable to pay, but\nrather to the life of the beneficiary\r\nspouse. This legislative provision should, however, not be viewed in\r\nisolation. The common\nlaw viewed the duty of support which spouses\r\nowed each other, and consequently the liability for maintenance, as\r\nincidents of their\nmatrimonial relationship. Termination of\nthe\r\nrelationship by death brought that duty to an end\n.\n1\n[11]\tThe Maintenance of Surviving\r\nSpouses Act 27 of 1990 (the MSSA) allowed widows and widowers, in\r\nspecified circumstances, to\nbe maintained from the estates of their\r\nlate partners.\n2\nUp until the promulgation of the MSSA there was no such entitlement.\r\nThe MSSA was limited legislative intervention, altering the\ncommon\r\nlaw to the extent set out therein. The common law rule remained\r\notherwise untouched.\n[12]\tIt can hardly be argued that\r\nbefore the MSSA came into being, divorced persons, whose erstwhile\r\nspouses had died, were in a\nmore favourable position than widowed\r\nones, giving them ârights against the estates of people no longer\r\nmarried to them at the\ntime of death which widowed spouses did not\r\nenjoy against the estates of those to whom they were then still\r\nmarried.â\n3\n[13]\tI agree with the conclusion\r\nreached by Didcott J in\nHodges\r\nv Coubrough\n,\n4\nthat\ns 7(2)\nof the\nDivorce Act cannot\nbe construed so as to alter the\r\ncommon law position reflected in para 10 above. The following passage\r\nfrom that case (at 64E-F)\nis worth noting:\nâ\nHad [the legislature]\r\nmeant something so surprising, something so startling, it would\r\nsurely have spelt out the meaning. It would\nhardly have left such to\r\nbe conveyed by the sidewind of generally worded provisions which,\r\nwhile accommodating the idea linguistically,\ndealt with it obliquely\r\nand elliptically.â\n[14]\tThe court below held that\ns 7(2)\nwas inapplicable, in that, rehabilitative maintenance is âan animal\r\nof its ownâ, and if ordered in the terms referred to in\npara 3, the\r\nestate of âthe maintaining spouseâ is liable to pay the\r\noutstanding maintenance. On that basis the court below\ngranted the\r\nfirst respondent the relief sought.\n[15]\tCounsel on behalf of the first\r\nrespondent rightly conceded before us that if rehabilitative\r\nmaintenance is to be regarded as\na species of maintenance the appeal\r\nshould succeed. Rehabilitative maintenance is most certainly a\r\nspecies of maintenance. I cannot\nimagine how rehabilitative\r\nmaintenance can be maintenance of a kind that does not fall within\r\nthe ambit of\ns 7(2)\nof the\nDivorce Act. For\nthis reason alone the\r\nappeal should succeed. There are further considerations that militate\r\nagainst the conclusion reached by the\ncourt below, which are alluded\r\nto hereafter.\n[16]\tOf course a spouse is free to\r\nagree to bind his/her estate to pay maintenance after death. That is\r\nnot what occurred in the\npresent case.  To allow maintenance claims\r\nof the kind encountered here against deceased estates might have all\r\nsorts of undesirable\nconsequences. The legitimate claims to\r\nmaintenance of minor children might be diminished or excluded. And,\r\nthe rights of beneficiaries\nmight be implicated.\nSection 3\n(b)\nof the MSSA provides that a claim for maintenance of a surviving\r\nspouse shall have the same order of preference against the estate\nof\r\nthe deceased spouse as a claim for maintenance of a dependant child\r\nof such deceased person and that in the event of competing\nclaims,\r\neach shall, if necessary be reduced proportionately. Theoretically, a\r\nclaim for maintenance such as the present one could\ncompete with the\r\nclaim of a surviving spouse and with claims by dependant children and\r\nbeneficiaries. In the absence of legislative\nregulation the\r\npermutations and uncertainties abound.\n[17]\tFurthermore, maintenance is\r\nalways relative to the means and needs of the respective spouses. In\r\nthe present case the earning\ncapacity of the first respondent was\r\nheld not to be a changed circumstance on which the deceased could\r\nrely to seek a variation\nof the maintenance order. The propriety of\r\nthat aspect of the order appears to be doubtful. But that issue is\r\nnot before us.  In\nany event, that portion of the order did not\r\npreclude the deceased from approaching a maintenance court to seek a\r\nvariation based\non a diminution in or lack of means. Remarriage was\r\nnot excluded. To subject a deceased estate to assessments of this\r\nkind is not\nonly undesirable but appears to me to offend against\r\nfirst principles.\n[18]\tIf there is to be intervention of\r\nany kind it should be by the legislature on an informed and\r\nwell-considered basis. For the\nmoment the legislature is content with\ns 7(2)\nof the\nDivorce Act. So\ntoo, should we be.\n[19]\tThe following order is made:\n1.\tThe appeal is upheld with costs.\n2.\tThe order of the court below is set\r\naside and substituted as follows:\nâ\nThe application is\r\ndismissed with costs.â\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nAppellant:\t\tM C Erasmus SC\nInstructed\r\nby\nDu\r\nPlessis Attorneys Sandton\nSymington\r\n& De Kok Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent:\tL C Matthysen\nInstructed\r\nby\nChris\r\nKotzé & Partners c/o Hendriëtte Müller Attorneys\r\nPretoria\nMcIntyre\r\n& Van Der Post Bloemfontein\n1\nSee\nGlazer v Glazer NO\n1963\r\n\t(4) SA 694 (A).\n2\nSection 2(1)\nprovides:\nâ\nIf\r\n\ta marriage is dissolved by death after the commencement of this Act\r\n\tthe survivor shall have a claim against the estate of the\ndeceased\r\n\tspouse for the provision of his reasonable maintenance needs until\r\n\this death or remarriage in so far as he is not able\nto provide\r\n\ttherefor from his own means and earnings.â\n3\nPer Didcott J in\nHodges v\r\n\tCoubrough\n1991 (3) SA 58\n(D & CLD) at 64B-E.\n4\nOp cit\n64E-G.",

    "facts": "Fred Kruger and Denise Emmerentia Goss married in 1988 out of community of property. They divorced in 2005, and the court ordered the ex-husband to pay rehabilitative maintenance of R8,000 per month for three months and R6,000 per month for the next 57 months. The ex‑husband paid installments until August 2006, having paid 33 of the 57 instalments, and died on 29 September 2006. The executor of his estate was later sued by the former wife for the remaining R144,000 (24 months × R6,000). The High Court granted the claim, ordering the estate to pay, which was appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The appeal concerned whether a court‑ordered rehabilitative maintenance payment, granted pursuant to a divorce decree, is enforceable against the deceased spouse’s estate under section 7(2) of the Divorce Act and the common law duty of support.",
    "principles": "Section 7(2) of the Divorce Act allows maintenance orders to continue until the death or remarriage of the beneficiary. However, the common law treats the duty of support as an incident of the marital relationship, which ends on death. The Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990 creates a limited statutory right for surviving spouses to claim maintenance from a deceased spouse’s estate, but does not extend to divorced spouses. Precedent in Hodges v Coubrough (Didcott J) confirms that s 7(2) was not intended to alter the common‑law position.",
    "application": "The Court held that rehabilitative maintenance falls within the scope of s 7(2) and therefore is a personal obligation of the paying spouse, not a liability that survives his death. Allowing claims against a deceased estate would conflict with the common‑law rule, create uncertainty for other dependent claims (children, beneficiaries), and exceed the limited legislative intervention of the MSSA. Consequently, the lower court’s view that the estate was liable was rejected.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The High Court order was set aside and replaced with an order dismissing the application with costs. The deceased estate is not liable for the outstanding rehabilitative maintenance."
