Separate\namounts were claimed by the appellant and\r\nAjubatis Properties (Pty) Ltd.\n[3]\tOn 16 November 2004 the appellant and its\r\nco-plaintiff gave notice of their intention to amend the particulars\r\nof claim by (a)\nsubstituting one John Brook Dyer as the plaintiff and\r\n(b) alleging that Mr Dyer during 2003 had acquired, by cession, their\r\nclaims\nagainst the respondent. The amendments sought were effected on\r\n15 April 2005.\n[4]\tThe respondent pleaded to the amended particulars of\r\nclaim. One of the defences raised in the plea was that in terms of\r\nthe\nsale agreement the sellers, ie, the appellant and its erstwhile\r\nco-plaintiff, were not entitled to cede any of their rights.\n[5]\tThis defence led to a further amendment to the\r\nparticulars of claim in terms of which the appellant was substituted\r\nfor Mr Dyer\nas the plaintiff in the action and the appellant claimed\r\nits share of the amount outstanding (its claim for which it had\r\npurported\nto cede to Mr Dyer). Notice of this amendment was given in\r\nOctober 2006 and the amendment was effected on 10 November 2006.\n[6]\tThe respondent then pleaded to the re-amended\r\nparticulars of claim, raising a special plea of prescription as well\r\nas pleading\ndefences on the merits (with which it is unnecessary to\r\ndeal in this judgment).\n[7]\tThe special plea of prescription was based on\ns\r\n11(d)\nof the\nPrescription Act 68 of 1969\n. The averments pleaded in\r\nsupport thereof may be summarised as follows:\n(a)\tthe debt was due on or before 30 September 2001;\n(b)\tduring April 2006 the appellant and its co-plaintiff\r\nwere replaced by Mr Dyer as the plaintiff;\n(c)\tduring November 2006 Mr Dyer was replaced by the\r\nappellant as the plaintiff;\n(d)\tthe question as to whether the appellant's claim has\r\nprescribed must be determined by reference to the amendment which\r\nmost\nrecently made it a party to the proceedings, ie, the amendment\r\neffected on 10 November 2006.\n[8]\tAt the commencement of the trial Joffe J ruled\nmero\r\nmotu,\nin terms of\nrule 33(4)\n, that the\r\nspecial plea be determined before any other issues.\n[9]\tAfter argument, the learned judge gave judgment\r\nupholding the special plea. Before his judgment is summarised it will\r\nbe convenient\nif the relevant provisions of Act 68 of 1969 are set\r\nout.\nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n[10]\tSection 11(d) provides that the period of\r\nprescription in respect of a debt such as the one presently under\r\nconsideration shall\nbe three years.\n[11]\tSection 12(1) provides that subject to subsections\r\n(2) and (3), which are not relevant in this case, prescription shall\r\ncommence\nto run as soon as the debt is due.\n[12]\tSection 13 deals with circumstances in which\r\ncompletion of prescription is delayed. Subsection (1) provides as\r\nfollows:\n'(1)\tIfâ\n(a)\nthe creditor is a minor\r\nor is insane or is a person under curatorship or is prevented by\r\nsuperior force including any law or any\norder of court from\r\ninterrupting the running of prescription as contemplated in section\r\n15(1); or\n(b)\nthe debtor is outside the\r\nRepublic; or\n(c)\nthe creditor and debtor\r\nare married to each other; or\n(d)\nthe creditor and debtor\r\nare partners and the debt is a debt which arose out of the\r\npartnership relationship; or\n(e)\nthe creditor is a\r\njuristic person and the debtor is a member of the governing body of\r\nsuch juristic person; or\n(f)\nthe debt is the object of\r\na dispute subjected to arbitration; or\n(g)\nthe debt is the object of\r\na claim filed against the estate of a debtor who is deceased or\r\nagainst the insolvent estate of the debtor\nor against a company in\r\nliquidation or against an applicant under the Agricultural Credit\r\nAct, 1966; or\n(h)\nthe creditor or the\r\ndebtor is deceased and an executor of the estate in question has not\r\nyet been appointed; and\n(i)\nthe relevant period of\r\nprescription would, but for the provisions of this subsection, be\r\ncompleted before or on, or within one\nyear after, the day on which\r\nthe relevant impediment referred to in paragraph\n(a),\r\n(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)\nor\n(h)\nhas ceased to exist,\nthe period of prescription shall not be completed before\r\na year has elapsed after the day referred to in paragraph\n(i).'\n[13]\tSection 15, as far as is material, provides as\r\nfollows:\n'(1)\tThe running of prescription shall, subject to the\r\nprovisions of subsection (2), be interrupted by the service on the\r\ndebtor\nof any process whereby the creditor claims payment of the\r\ndebt.\n(2)\tUnless the debtor acknowledges liability, the\r\ninterruption of prescription in terms of subsection (1) shall lapse,\r\nand the running\nof prescription shall not be deemed to have been\r\ninterrupted, if the creditor does not successfully prosecute his\r\nclaim under the\nprocess in question to final judgment or if he does\r\nso prosecute his claim but abandons the judgment or the judgment is\r\nset aside.\n. . .\n(6)\tFor the purposes of this section, \"process\"\r\nincludes a petition, a notice of motion, a rule\nnisi,\na pleading in reconvention, a third party\r\nnotice referred to in any rule of court, and any document whereby\r\nlegal proceedings are\ncommenced.'\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nA\r\nQUO\n[14]\tThe only point considered by the learned judge in\r\nthe court\na quo\nrelated to the question as to whether the service of the original\r\nsummons in this matter, in terms of which the appellant together\nwith\r\nAjubatis Properties (Pty) Ltd claimed monies from the respondent,\r\ninterrupted prescription. In his view it did not because,\nas he put\r\nit, they 'did not prosecute their claim until final judgment.' When\r\nthe amendment introducing Mr Dyer as the plaintiff\nwas effected, he\r\nheld, the appellant and Ajubatis Properties (Pty) Ltd\n'fell out the proceedings. Furthermore in terms of s\r\n15(2) of the act, the summons issued by them did not have the effect\r\nof interrupting\nprescription.'\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL\n[15]\tIn its application for leave to appeal (which Joffe\r\nJ granted) the appellant sought leave to appeal on the ground that\r\nthe\nproceedings which were commenced by way of summons at the\r\ninstance of the appellant and Ajubatis Properties (Pty) Ltd were not\r\nterminated by the substitution of Mr Dyer as the plaintiff and that\r\nthe re-introduction of the appellant as the plaintiff in the\nplace of\r\nMr Dyer did not constitute a fresh action which commenced only after\r\nthe debt allegedly owing by the respondent to the\nappellant had\r\nprescribed.\n[16]\tIn the heads of argument filed on behalf of the\r\nappellant by counsel (who had not appeared in the High Court) the\r\njudgment\nof the court\na quo\nwas\r\nattacked on two grounds: the ground on which leave was granted and a\r\nnew ground to the effect that the prescription of the appellant's\n\nclaim had been interrupted, in terms of s 13(1)(b) of the Act,\r\nbecause at all material times the respondent had been outside the\n\nRepublic. This submission was based on the fact that the respondent\r\nis a foreign company, incorporated and registered in the United\n\nKingdom, with its chosen\ndomicilium citandi et\r\nexecutandi\nat an address in London. The\r\nappellant applied at the hearing of the appeal for leave to file a\r\nreplication to the respondent's\nspecial plea in which this ground was\r\nspecifically pleaded. The respondent not having opposed the\r\napplication, the application\nwas granted.\n[17]\tThe appellant's replication reads as follows:\n'1.At all times material hereto:\n1.1.\tThe defendant's citation has been as pleaded in the\r\nparticulars of claim, namely, the defendant has been incorporated and\r\nregistered\nin accordance with the Laws of England and Wales under\r\nregistration number 2857671, and with its chosen domicilium citandi\r\net executandi\nat 120 Campden Hill Road, London, V87AR, United\r\nKingdom.\n1.2.\tThe defendant has accordingly been outside the\r\nRepublic, as contemplated by section 13(1)(b) of the Prescription\r\nAct, 68 of\n1969 (\"the Act\").\n2.\tAt no stage has the above impediment ceased to exist,\r\nfor the purposes of section 13(1)(i) of the Act.\n3.\tIn the premises, any period of prescription relied\r\nupon by the defendant has not been completed.\nWHEREFORE the plaintiff prays that the defendant's\r\nspecial plea be dismissed with costs.'\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\n[18]\tIn argument before this court counsel for the\r\nappellant contended that the court\na quo\nerred\r\nin two respects. Its first error was the result, so it was contended,\r\nof its failure to have regard to the fact that the respondent\ndebtor\r\nis a British company and accordingly that s 13(1)(b) of the Act\r\napplied so as to delay the completion of the period of prescription.\n\nIt was contended further that the respondent, being a peregrine\r\ncompany, was\nex facie\nthe\r\nadmitted facts on the pleadings at all relevant times absent from the\r\nRepublic. It was pointed out that the respondent is not\nan external\r\ncompany with its memorandum registered in this country as was the\r\ncase in\nDithaba Platinum (Pty) Ltd v\r\nErconovaal Ltd\n1985 (4) SA 615\n(T).\n[19]\tCounsel also contended that the fact that the\r\nrespondent was amenable to the jurisdiction of the South African\r\ncourt, either\nby owning property in this country or by consenting to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court, does not detract from the fact\r\nthat\nthe respondent remained absent from the Republic: in support of\r\nthis submission counsel referred to\nGrinaker\r\nMechanicals (Pty) Ltd v SocietÃ© Francaise Industriale et D'Equipment\n1976 (4) SA 98(C)\n, esp at 102A-H.\n[20]\tSince the respondent has at all material times been\r\nabsent from the Republic, the argument proceeded, and the respondent\r\nitself\nled no evidence nor suggested that that was not the case, the\r\nrunning of prescription could not be completed before one year had\n\nelapsed after the respondent ceased to be absent from the Republic â\r\n'if that were ever to occur.' It was accordingly submitted\nthat as\r\nthe relevant impediment never ceased the period of prescription\r\nprovided in s 13 has never been completed.\n[21]\tThe court\na quo's\nsecond\r\nerror, according to the argument of counsel for the appellant,\r\nconsisted in holding that s 15(2) of the Act applied. Counsel\n\nsubmitted that it was not in dispute on the common cause facts that\r\nby the institution of the original proceedings in 2001 the\nrunning of\r\nprescription in respect of the claim against the respondent was\r\ninterrupted. They contended that, despite the substitution\nof Mr Dyer\r\nas the plaintiff in 2005 and the subsequent re-substitution of the\r\nappellant in 2006 as the plaintiff in respect of\npart of the original\r\nclaim, 'the process that commenced with the institution of action [in\r\n2001] is in substance the same process\nthat was being conducted at\r\nthe instance of the appellant when the matter came before Joffe J'\r\nand 'section 15(2) of the . . .\nAct could have had no application.'\n[22]\tThey went on to submit that the significance of the\r\nphrase 'the process in question' is apparent if regard is had to the\r\nmemorandum\non the draft bill prepared for the South African Law\r\nCommission by the late Professor JC de Wet in which the mischief at\r\nwhich\ns 15(2) is directed is set out. The memorandum in question is\r\npublished in JC de Wet:\nOpuscula Miscellanea:\r\nRegsgeleerde Lesings en Adviese\n(1979) at pp\r\n77\net seq.\nIn the\r\npassage on which counsel relied (at p 128) Professor De Wet said that\r\nthe service of a summons ought\n'sy stuitende werking te verloor indien die skuldeiser\ndie proses nie aan die gang hou nie,\nanders kan dit gebeur dat die skuldeiser telkens deur dagvaarding die\r\nloop van verjaring stuit en daardeur die toestand van onsekerheid\n\nverleng. Indien my voorstel aanvaar word sal die diening van\r\ndagvaarding sy stuitende werking verloor\nindien\r\ndie skuldeiser die dagvaarding\nintrek,\naliter\nDjaperides v\r\nFederal Insurance Corporation of SA Ltd\n1955\r\n(2) SA 396\n(W) of the hof die gedaagde van die instansie absolveer,\r\naliter\nPistorius & Kie v Steyn\n1958\r\n(3) SA 440\n(T).'\n[23]\tCounsel argued that the appellant had acted\r\ndiligently in instituting the proceedings in 2001, that the\r\nsubstitution of Mr\nDyer as plaintiff and its resubstitution did not\r\nevince a subjective intention on the part of the appellant, which at\r\nall times\nremained the creditor, to release the respondent from the\r\ndebt owed and that 'the same proceedings (as that expression is\r\ngenerally\nused) were still\nin esse\nbefore\r\nJoffe J.' Although there had been a substitution of plaintiff the\r\nsame debt had throughout been pursued by way of the same\nlitigation.\r\nThe appellant, they submitted, had continued to prosecute its claim\r\n'under the process in question' (viz the summons\nissued in 2001) and\r\nthere had accordingly been no lapsing of the interruption of\r\nprescription.\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n[24]\tCounsel for the respondent submitted that on a\r\nproper construction of  s 13(1)(b) of the Act the respondent was not\r\n'outside\nthe Republic'. It was pointed out that the original summons\r\nin this matter was served in South Africa on the respondent in the\r\nfollowing circumstances:\n(a)\tthe respondent agreed to accept service care of its\r\nSouth African attorneys; and\n(b)\tthe shareholders' agreement on which the appellant's\r\ncause of action is based provided that the parties thereto submitted\r\nthemselves\nto the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Johannesburg High\r\nCourt for the purposes of any proceedings arising out of or in\r\nconnection\nwith the agreement.\n[25]\tPointing to the fact that the absence of a debtor\r\nfrom the Republic is described in s 13(1)(i) as an 'impediment', they\r\nsubmitted\nthat at no stage was the registration of the respondent as\r\na foreign company an impediment to the service of summons in South\r\nAfrica.\n[26]\tThey contended further that the argument raised by\r\nthe appellant leads, as they put it, to the 'absurd conclusion' that\r\ndespite\nthe respondent's having consented to be sued in South Africa,\r\nthe appellant's claim against the respondent will never prescribe\n\nbecause the respondent will always be absent from the Republic.\n[27]\tWith regard to the contention raised by the\r\nappellant's counsel based on s 15(2) of the Act counsel for the\r\nrespondent submitted\nthat the appellant did not prosecute its claim\r\nunder the original summons to final judgment and accordingly the\r\ninterruption of\nprosecution by that process lapsed.\n[28]\tReferring to the fact that the amendment of October\r\n2006, in which notice was given that the appellant was to be\r\nsubstituted\nfor Mr Dyer as the plaintiff, qualifies as process under\r\ns 15(6) (see\nMias de Klerk Boerdery (Edms) Bpk\r\nv Cole\n1986 (2) SA 284\n(N) at 287I-288B),\r\ncounsel for the respondent submitted that this is the process whereby\r\nit now claims the debt and under which,\nif it were to obtain judgment\r\nin its favour, it would successfully prosecute its claim to final\r\njudgment. Without the October 2006\nnotice of amendment the appellant\r\ncould not have claimed payment of the debt.\n[29]\tCounsel for the respondent contended further that\r\nif their argument on this point were to be upheld this would not be\r\nat variance\nwith the mischief s 15(2) was designed to prevent. This\r\nwas because the appellant had not kept its original process going.\n[30]\tIt followed, so they submitted, that the second\r\npoint raised by the appellant also had to be rejected.\nDISCUSSION\n(i)\nWas the respondent 'outside\r\nthe Republic' in terms of s 13(1)(b)?\n[31]\tAs appears from s 13 read as a whole the fact that\r\na debtor is outside the Republic (as a result of which the completion\r\nof\nprescription is delayed) is regarded by the legislature as an\r\n'impediment'. The various impediments listed in s 13(1) are\r\ncircumstances\nwhich, as Professor M M Loubser puts it in his work\nExtinctive Prescription\nat\r\np 117, 'have in common some legal or practical problem which makes it\r\ndifficult or undesirable for a creditor to institute proceedings\nfor\r\nthe enforcement of his claim against the debtor.' See also\nABP\r\n4x4 Motor Dealers (Pty) Ltd v IGI Insurance Co Ltd\n1999\r\n(3) SA 924\n(SCA) at 930I-931A, where it was said that '(t)he word\r\nimpediment . . . covers a wide spectrum of situations ranging from\r\nthose\nin which it would not be possible in law for the creditor to\r\nsue to those in which it might be difficult or awkward, but not\r\nimpossible,\nto sue.' Where, as in the present case, the debtor has\r\nnot only consented to the jurisdiction of the South African Court but\r\nalso\nagreed to accept service of process care of its South African\r\nattorneys\n1\nthere is no circumstance which gives rise to a problem which creates\r\na difficult or undesirable situation for a creditor seeking\nto\r\ninstitute legal proceedings against the debtor in this country. Is it\r\nlikely that Parliament would have intended the completion\nof\r\nprescription to be delayed in those circumstances? The only purpose\r\nthat it would serve would be to prevent prescription from\never being\r\ncompleted against the respondent, which as the respondent's counsel\r\nsubmitted, would lead to an absurd conclusion. It\ncertainly would not\r\nadvance the evident purpose of the provision, which is to assist a\r\ncreditor which has a legal or practical\nproblem in relation to the\r\ninstitution of legal proceedings in South Africa against its debtor.\n[32]\tI think that to interpret the phrase 'outside the\r\nRepublic' as covering a case where, although the debtor itself is\r\nphysically\noutside the Republic, it has consented to the jurisdiction\r\nof the South African courts in respect of a claim and has a\r\nrepresentative\nhere whom it has authorised to receive service on its\r\nbehalf of any process in which the claim in question is sought to be\r\nenforced\nwould give a meaning to the provision under consideration\r\nwhich Parliament could never have intended.\n[33]\tThe first South African statute which provided for\r\nthe completion of prescription to be delayed while the debtor was\r\n'absent\nfrom the Colony' was s 6 of the Prescription Amendment Act 6\r\nof 1861 (Cape), which was based on s 19 of the Act for the Amendment\n\nof the Law and the better Advancement of Justice, 4&5 Anne, c 16,\r\npassed by the English Parliament in 1705. Similar legislation\nto the\r\nCape act was passed in Natal (s 10 of Law 14 of 1861), the Orange\r\nFree State (s 6 of Chapter XXIII of the Law Book) and\nthe Transvaal\r\n(s 11(2) of Act 26 of 1908). The pre-Union statutes were repealed by\r\nthe Prescription Act 18 of 1943, which provided\nin s 7(1)(c) for the\r\nsuspension of prescription 'during the absence of the debtor from the\r\nUnion for a period exceeding six months'\nand in s 10 that '(w)hen the\r\ndebtor is absent from the Union extinctive prescription shall not\r\nbegin to run until the date of his\nreturn' (which was interpreted as\r\nmeaning the date when the debor ceased to be absent: see\nGrinaker's\ncase,\nsupra,\nat\r\n100C to 102A, and the authorities there referred to).\n[34]\tThe provision in the statute from Queen Anne's\r\nreign on which s 6 of the Cape Act of 1861 was based was also copied,\r\nwith various\nforms of wording, in the various states of the United\r\nStates of America, where suspending or stopping the running of a\r\nstatute\nof limitations is called 'tolling' ('it is analogous to a\r\nclock stopping then restarting', 51\nAmerican\r\nJurisprudence\n2d, para 169). A very\r\ninformative annotation headed 'Absence as Tolling Statute of\r\nLimitations' is to be found in 55 American Law\nReports 3d at p 1158\net seq.\nIt is an\r\nannotation on\nByrne v Ogle\n(1971\r\nAlaska) 55\nALR 3d 1151, a decision of the Supreme Court of Alaska.\r\nThe annotation collects and discusses American cases considering\r\nwhether\nand under what circumstances a provision 'tolling' the\r\nstatute of limitations while a party is outside the jurisdiction\r\napplies\nwhere, notwithstanding such absence, the party remains\r\namenable to service of process which subjects him to the personal\r\njurisdiction\nof the state.\n2\nAs is to be expected, the American courts have not spoken with one\r\nvoice on the topic, nor have the statutory provisions considered\nbeen\r\nuniformly drafted. Many of the cases discussed have turned on the\r\nparticular wording of the statutes under consideration.\nIn others,\r\nhowever, general considerations apart from the construction of\r\nparticular tolling provisions have been discussed and\nthese cases\r\nraise points which have relevance in the present context. In\r\nparticular at pp 1186-1187 Kenneth J Rampino, the author\nof the\r\nannotation, refers to a series of cases, the latest of which was\nByrne v Ogle, supra,\nin\r\nwhich it was held that the purpose of the statute of limitations,\r\nthat of eliminating stale claims, would be contravened if the\nrunning\r\nof the period were suspended during mere physical absence of a party\r\nwho remained subject to personal jurisdiction by some\nform of\r\nsubstituted process.\n[35]\tThe present case is, of course, stronger than the\r\nAmerican cases to which I have referred because here it was possible\r\nfor\nthe appellant to serve the original summons served on the\r\nrespondent not by substituted service but by service on its own\r\nattorneys\nwho were authorised to receive service on its behalf.\n[36]\tAs I have said the appellant's counsel relied\r\nstrongly on the decision in\nGrinaker\r\nMechanicals Ltd, supra,\nwhich was cited as\r\nauthority for the proposition that\n'(t)here is nothing in the wording of sec 10 [of the\r\n1943 Prescription Act] to justify the conclusion that the Legislature\r\nintended\nto confer the benefit of prescription upon a debtor who,\r\ndespite his continued absence from the Republic, became amenable to\r\nbe\nsued in respect of his debt in a Republican Court. If that was the\r\nintention of the Legislature it certainly has not been made apparent\n\nin the terms of sec 10.'\n[37]\tThe debtor in\nGrinaker's\ncase was a company incorporated according to\r\nthe laws of France and carrying on business in Paris. At all relevant\r\ntimes it was\nphysically absent from the Republic. In an action\r\nbrought against it for moneys due under a contract for work and\r\nlabour it filed\na special plea that the plaintiff's claim had\r\nprescribed as the cause of action arose prior to 1 October 1968 and\r\nthe summons was\nserved on 4 December 1974, although it had been\r\nissued on 13 January 1969. In response to a request for particulars\r\nby the plaintiff\nthe defendant stated that it was a\nperegrinus\nand had never been present in the Republic of South Africa. The\r\nplaintiff took exception to the plea on the ground that as the\n\ndefendant had at all material times been absent from the Republic\r\nwithin the meaning of s 10 of the 1943 Prescription Act the period\nof\r\nextinctive prescription had not begun to run against the plaintiff.\n[38]\tThe defendant then sought to amend its special plea\r\nby inserting an averment to the effect that on 18 December 1968 and\r\nby\norder of the Cape Provincial Division the plaintiff attached\r\nproperty of the defendant\nad fundandam\r\njurisdiction,\nfrom which date the plaintiff's\r\nright of action against the defendant became enforceable in the Cape\r\nProvincial Division.\n[39]\tThe application to amend the special plea was\r\nrefused and the exception taken to it was upheld on the basis that\r\nthe insertion\nof the averment summarised above would not save it from\r\nbeing excipiable. The reason for this conclusion is set out in the\r\npassage\ncited above.\n[40]\tIt is thus clear that the amenability to the\r\ncourt's jurisdiction which was held not to lead to the conclusion\r\nthat the debtor\nwas no longer 'absent' was based on the attachment\nad\r\nfundandam jurisdictionem\nof its property. As\r\nis well known, an attachment of a debtor's property to found\r\njurisdiction does not render the debtor personally\nliable to the\r\ncourt's jurisdiction. A judgment obtained on the strength thereof\r\nonly binds the property attached and has no extra-territorial\nforce\r\nand obligation:\nJamieson v Sabingo\n2002\r\n(4) SA 49\n(SCA) at 58G-H. On the other hand a judgment founded on\r\nvoluntary submission to jurisdiction by a debtor would bind the\r\ndebtor\npersonally and would be internationally enforceable:\nibid\nat 58H. The amenability to jurisdiction\r\ndiscussed in the\nGrinaker\ncase\r\nonly concerned jurisdiction based on an attachment to found\r\njurisdiction. Other considerations may well apply where the\r\namenability\nto jurisdiction arises from a voluntary submission to the\r\njurisdiction by the debtor. Indeed it has been decided in the United\r\nStates 'by the great weight of authority' that the suspension of the\r\nrunning of the statute of limitations is not prevented by the\nfact\r\nthat the absent defendant had property in the state which might have\r\nbeen subject to attachment before the expiration of the\nperiod of\r\nlimitation, without the necessity of personal service on the\r\ndefendant: see Annotation at\n119 ALR 331\nat 337\net\r\nseq.\n[41]\tIt is not necessary, however, in this case to\r\ndecide whether amenability to jurisdiction over the debtor personally\r\nin circumstances\nwhere a judgment can be given which can be enforced\r\nagainst him internationally will lead to the conclusion that he is\r\nnot to be\nregarded as 'outside the Republic' for the purposes of s\r\n13(1)(b) of the Act. I say that because I am satisfied that the\r\ncombined\neffect of the submission by the respondent to the court's\r\njurisdiction and the authorisation to its attorneys to accept service\n\nof the summons clearly leads to the conclusion, for the reasons I\r\nhave stated, that it would go beyond the purpose of s 13(1)(b)\nif it\r\nwere held that the respondent in this matter, despite what it had\r\ndone to remove any difficulty or awkwardness which the\nappellant\r\nmight otherwise have encountered in an attempt to institute\r\nproceedings against it to claim the debt allegedly owing\nin this\r\nmatter, was 'outside the Republic'. It follows that the first\r\ncontention advanced by the appellant's counsel must fail.\n(ii)\nDoes s 15(2) apply?\n[42]\tIn regard to the second point raised by counsel for\r\nthe appellant I agree with the argument of counsel for the respondent\r\nthat\nif the appellant were to obtain final judgment in its favour in\r\nthis matter, the process under which it would obtain such judgment\n\nwould be the notice of amendment of November 2006. It follows that s\r\n15(2) of the Act applied and the interruption of prescription\nbrought\r\nabout by service of the original summons lapsed. In the circumstances\r\nthe second point raised by the appellant's counsel\nmust also fail.\nORDER\n[43]\tThe following order is made:\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs, including those\r\noccasioned by the employment of two counsel.\nâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦\n.\nIG FARLAM\nAPPEARANCES:\nFOR APPELLANT: \t\tJ J GAUNTLETT\r\nSC\nJ C BUTLER SC\nInstructed by\tRoutledge Modise\r\nin Association with Eversheds Johannesburg\nMcIntyre & Van der Post\r\nBloemfontein\nFOR RESPONDENT:\tA F BHAM SC\nW PYE\nInstructed by\t\t\tBowman Gilfillan\r\nInc Johannesburg\nLovius-Block\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nOn the face of the original summons the following\r\n\tappears after the name and address of the respondent: 'who has\r\n\tagreed to accept\nservice care of its attorneys, Bowman Gilfillan\r\n\tIncorporated, 9\nth\nFloor, Twin Towers West, Sandton City, Sandton, Johannesburg.'\n2\nAfter their attention had been drawn to the\r\n\tAmerican authorities on the point, counsel on both sides submitted\r\n\tsupplementary heads\nof argument dealing therewith, for which I wish\r\n\tto express my gratitude.",

    "facts": "In 2001 Silouette Investments Ltd (the appellant) and co‑plaintiff Ajubatis Properties (Pty) Ltd instituted proceedings in the Johannesburg High Court against Virgin Hotels Group Ltd (the respondent) for amounts owing under a share‑sale agreement. The claim was amended in April 2005 to substitute John Brook Dyer as plaintiff, alleging a cession of the claim. The respondent disputed the cession, leading to a further amendment in November 2006 which re‑substituted Silouette as plaintiff. The respondent raised a special plea of prescription, arguing that the debt had prescribed under the Prescription Act 68 of 1969.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the respondent, being a foreign company incorporated in the United Kingdom, was “outside the Republic” within the meaning of s 13(1)(b) of the Prescription Act, thereby suspending the running of prescription. 2. Whether the service of the original summons in 2001 interrupted prescription, and if so, whether that interruption lapsed under s 15(2) when the plaintiff was substituted and the claim was not prosecuted to final judgment.",
    "principles": "The Court considered the statutory framework of the Prescription Act: s 11(d) (three‑year prescription period), s 12(1) (prescription commences when debt becomes due), s 13(1) (impediments that toll prescription, including the debtor being outside the Republic), s 13(1)(i) (tolling continues until a year after the impediment ceases), and s 15(1)–(2) (service of process interrupts prescription, but the interruption lapses if the claim is not prosecuted to final judgment). Relevant case law included Grinaker Mechanicals Ltd (where physical absence combined with consent to jurisdiction did not halt prescription) and the earlier Grinaker decision on “outside the Republic” under the 1943 Prescription Act.",
    "application": "The Court held that the respondent’s consent to South African jurisdiction and the acceptance of service through its local attorneys removed any practical impediment; therefore the respondent was not “outside the Republic” for s 13(1)(b) purposes, and prescription was not suspended. Regarding s 15(2), the Court found that the original summons did not constitute a continuing process because the claim was never prosecuted to final judgment; the amendment in November 2006 represented a new process, causing the earlier interruption to lapse. Consequently, the prescription period had run and the special plea of prescription was upheld.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including the costs incurred in employing two counsel."
