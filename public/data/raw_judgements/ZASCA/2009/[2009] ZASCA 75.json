The defendant in the first action\r\n(and\nthe respondent in the first of the appeals) is EMI Music\r\nPublishing (Pty) Ltd ('EMI Publishing') and, in the second, EMI Music\r\n(Pty) Ltd ('EMI Music'). The respondents delivered notices to cure\r\nvagueness and embarrassment in terms of Rule 23(1) of the Uniform\n\nRules of Court and, no response to these notices having been received\r\nfrom the appellant, notices of exception were duly delivered.\nThe\r\ncases were dealt with as one by Jajbhay J for the purposes of\r\ndeciding them. The learned judge upheld the exceptions with costs\nand\r\ngave the appellant leave to amend the particulars of claim within 21\r\ndays. This appeal comes before us with the leave of the\ncourt below.\nThe Infringement Claims ('The\r\nFirst Exception')\n.\n[2]\tThe particulars of claim in each\r\nmatter commenced with a claim for damages based on copyright\r\ninfringement. The appellant claimed\nto have joint ownership of the\r\ncopyright in 157 works listed in an annexure to the summons. With\r\nfour exceptions\n1\nthe works listed (being music and lyrics for so-called 'pop songs')\r\nare works in which the late Ms Fassie collaborated with others\nto\r\ncompose them. They are accordingly works of 'joint authorship' as\r\ndefined in s1 of the Copyright Act 98 of 1978 ('the Act').\nHaving\r\nmade the necessary averments to establish that the works are entitled\r\nto copyright protection, the particulars of claim\nin the EMI\r\nPublishing action proceed as follows:-\n'4.\tFrom and\r\nsubsequent to 1980, the Defendant continuously, until the present\r\ntime, without the licence of the Plaintiff or any\nof the persons\r\nreferred to in paragraph 3.1.1.1 above (\nsc\nthe\r\njoint authors), and whilst the exclusive right to do so vested in the\r\nPlaintiff and the said persons:\n[\nreproduced,\r\npublished and made adaptations of the works and purported to grant\r\nlicences to third parties to perform similar acts]\n2\n5.\tIn the premises, the\r\ndefendant, during the said period, infringed the copyright in respect\r\nof the said works, referred to in\nparagraph 3 above.\n6.\tThe defendant at all relevant\r\ntimes bore knowledge of the fact that such conduct constituted an\r\ninfringement as aforesaid.\n7.\tThe Defendant received\r\nroyalties for performing the acts set out in paragraph 4 supra.\n8.\tThe damages suffered by the\r\nPlaintiff constitute the reasonable royalty that would have been\r\npayable by a licensee in respect\nof the work.\n9.\tThe plaintiff has no\r\nknowledge of the extent of the royalties the Defendant received as\r\naforestated.\n10.\tIn order to determine the\r\namount of a reasonable royalty, having regard to the provisions of\nsection 24(1B)\nof the\nCopyright Act, the\nPlaintiff will seek an order\r\ndirecting that an enquiry be held.'\n[3]\nThe\r\nrelief sought in respect of the infringement claim is an order for\r\ndamages equivalent to the royalties which would reasonably\nhave been\r\npayable by a licensee of the copyright and an enquiry aimed at\r\nestablishing the amount of such royalties. There is a\nfurther prayer\r\nfor what are sometimes referred to as 'punitive damages' based on the\r\nprovisions of s 24 (3) of the Act.\n3\n[4]\tThe particulars in the EMI Music action are almost\r\nidentical to those set out above, save that the date of inception of\r\nthe\nalleged acts of infringement in paragraph 4 is 1993, the words\r\n'and/or fees' appear after the word 'royalties' in paragraph 7 and\n\nthe words 'and that the defendant be ordered to pay to the Plaintiff\r\nthe amount found to be due pursuant thereto' appear after\nthe words\r\n'an inquiry to be held' at the end of paragraph 10. These variations\r\nare not material to the issues raised by the first\nexception in\r\neither action.\n[5]\tThe notices of exception taken to the claims based\r\non infringement, after recounting the nature of the copyright relied\r\nupon\nby the appellant, state that:\n'4.\tThe claims pursued by the\r\nplaintiff in this action are claims founded upon copyright ownership.\n5.\tThe\r\nplaintiff has not indicated that any of the joint authors listed in\r\nAnnexure A to the particulars has ceded or otherwise\nmade over their\r\ncopyright to Fassie. It is accordingly unclear on what basis the\r\nplaintiff has the requisite\nlocus\r\nstandi\nto sue on his own.\n6.\tThe\r\nparticulars are accordingly vague and embarrassing,\nalternatively\nlack averments necessary to sustain the cause of action, and the\r\ndefendant is accordingly unable to plead thereto.'\nThis will be referred to as 'the first exception'.\n[6]\tBefore dealing with the parties' respective\r\ncontentions, it will be convenient to refer briefly to the law\r\nconcerning joint\nauthorship of works protectable by copyright.\r\nSection 21(1)(a) of the Act states that:\n'Subject to the provisions of\r\nthis section, the ownership of any copyright conferred by section 3\r\nor 4 on any work shall vest in\nthe author or, in the case of a work\r\nof joint authorship, in the co-authors of the work.'\nSection 3 of the Act confers\r\ncopyright on,\ninter\r\nalia,\nany literary\r\nor musical work of which the author or any one of the joint authors\r\nis a South African citizen or is domiciled or\nresident in the\r\nRepublic at the time that the work is composed. It is not in dispute\r\nthat the late Ms Fassie and her co-authors\nin this case qualify under\r\nthe section. Although subsections 22(1) and 22(5) equate copyright to\r\nmovable property for the purpose\nof dealing with transmission of the\r\nrights by way of 'assignment, testamentary disposition or operation\r\nof law', there are features\nof co-ownership of copyright which differ\r\nfrom co-ownership of movables. Thus, for instance, one co-owner of\r\ncopyright does not\nhave the right, without the consent of the\r\nother(s), to exploit the rights comprising his copyright.\n4\nAs to the proportions in which individual co-authors are entitled to\r\nshare in the proceeds of the copyright, much will depend,\nin each\r\ninstance, on the basis on which the co-authors have agreed to\r\ncollaborate to produce the work. It is clear from the definition\nof a\r\n'work of joint authorship',\n5\nhowever, that in the absence of agreement between the co-authors, the\r\nshare of each will be an undivided one. In this regard\nCopinger\r\nand Skone James\n6\nsuggest that the circumstances surrounding the creation of the work\r\nwill generally be relevant to a decision as to the respective\nshare\r\nfor which each co-author qualifies. In the absence of clear contrary\r\nindications as to the parties' intention, it is suggested,\nthe\r\nco-authors will each be taken to hold an equal, undivided share as\r\n'tenants in common'. It seems that this is the position\nunder the\r\nAct, but it is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to\r\ninvestigate this aspect further. What is clear, and\nwhat was not in\r\ndispute in argument before us, is that one co-author cannot\r\nordinarily claim the whole proceeds of any exploitation\nof a work of\r\njoint authorship. It must follow that, in invoking the provisions of\r\nsection 24(1A) of the Act as a basis for quantifying\nhis or her claim\r\nfor damages, a co-author suing individually for damages for\r\ninfringement or their surrogate under the section\nwill be restricted\r\nto the portion of the 'reasonable royalty' to which he or she would\r\nhave been entitled if the work had been\nduly licensed.\n[7]\tThe debate about the first\r\nexception in the court below appears to have focused on a contention\r\nthat the infringement claims\nwere excipiable because the appellant\r\nhad not joined the joint authors in the action. Jajbhay J referred to\r\nvarious authorities\nto the effect that a joint owner should join his\r\nco-owner(s) in litigation concerning the joint property. As authority\r\nfor the\nproposition that non-joinder may be raised as a matter for\r\nexception, the learned judge referred to\nCollin\r\nv Toffie\n1944 AD\r\n456\n, and\nSmith v\r\nConelect\n1987 (3)\r\n689 (W). Apart from noting that Tindall JA in\nCollin\nstated that a point of non-joinder may be taken on exception, but\r\nonly if it is expressly referred to in the exception,\n7\nit is not necessary to consider whether the decision by Jajbhay J of\r\nthe first exception on the basis of joinder was correct in\nlaw. An\r\nexcipient is obliged to confine his complaint to the stated grounds\r\nof his exception. As in\nCollin\n,\r\nthe exceptions here contain no mention of non-joinder.  They\r\naccordingly fell to be decided on the grounds taken, namely that\nthe\r\nparticulars did not contain averments which founded the claim for\r\nrelief. Nor, in arguing the appeals, did counsel for either\nparty\r\npresent argument based on the ground of non-joinder.\n[8]\nMr\r\nGautschi\n, who\r\nappeared with\nMr\r\nSmit\nfor the\r\nappellant, submitted that, on a fair reading of the particulars of\r\nclaim, it was implicit that the plaintiff was only\nclaiming his pro\r\nrata share of the 'reasonable royalty' contemplated in section\r\n24(1A). I think that such an interpretation of\nthe particulars would\r\ninvolve more than just a 'fair reading' of the claims â it would\r\ninvolve interpolating presumptions and\na measure of speculation into\r\nthe particulars. On the basis set out in para 7, a plaintiff will not\r\nbe entitled to the whole of\nthe 'reasonable royalty' accruing from a\r\nwork of co-authorship unless, at the time of the creation of the\r\nwork, there was an agreement\nbetween the co-authors that the\r\nplaintiff was to be entitled to all the fruits of the work or, of\r\ncourse, unless the plaintiff\nhad taken cession of the rights of his\r\nco-author(s). The matter is complicated in a case such as this where\r\na substantial number\nof the works are alleged to be the product of\r\nmore than two authors. The short answer to the question raised by the\r\nexception is\nsimply that the averments in the particulars of claim,\r\nread fairly, are silent as to the basis upon which the plaintiff\r\ncontends\nthat he is entitled to the 'damages' which he claims. As to\r\nthe claim for 'punitive damages', I consider that such damages would\n\nultimately have to be assessed as a lump sum figure which would have\r\nto be shared pro rata by the co-authors. The defendant in\nthis\r\nsituation would be exposed to substantial prejudice if he were to be\r\nordered to pay the plaintiff the total amount of such\ndamages but\r\nstill remain exposed to a similar claim by one or more of the other\r\nco-authors. The absence of averments relating to\nthe plaintiffs share\r\nof the copyright accordingly has the effect of rendering the claim\r\nfor 'punitive damages' excipiable as well,\non the basis submitted in\r\nthe exceptions..\nThe Exceptions Based on Vagueness\r\n('The Second Exception').\n[9]\tEach defendant relied upon an exception based on the\r\ncontention that the claim for damages was vague and embarrassing for\r\nwant\nof particularity as to the royalties allegedly received by the\r\ndefendants from the acts of infringement. (These will hereinafter\nbe\r\nreferred to as 'the second exception' in each case.) Jajbhay J upheld\r\nthese exceptions. In response to the submission on behalf\nof the\r\nplaintiff that s 24(1B) of the Act expressly provides for an enquiry\r\nas to what would be a reasonable royalty 'for the purposes\nof\r\ndetermining the amount of damages', the learned judge said:\n'\nSection 24\n(1B) of the\nCopyright Act contemplates\nand permits an enquiry into\r\nthe quantum of damages only, and not into the existence of an act of\r\ninfringement. Proof of infringement\nof copyright, in respect of which\r\nthe plaintiff bears the\nonus\n,\r\nis a pre-requisite to any entitlement to invoke the enquiry\r\nprovisions of\nsection 24\n(1B). It is at the level of proof of\r\ninfringement that the plaintiff's particulars fail. Consequently, the\r\nprovisions of\nsection 24(1B)\noffer no assistance to the plaintiff\r\nagainst this exception.'\nThere was no basis, in the\r\ncircumstances of these cases, to assess the appellant's prospects of\r\nproving wh\nat is\r\nalleged. The appellant alleged that the respondent, in each action,\r\nreceived royalties from the acts of infringement and that\nhe has no\r\nknowledge of their extent.\nSection 24(1B)\nwas obviously inserted into\r\nthe Act to cover just such a contingency. I may say that\nMr\r\nLiebowitz\n, for the\r\nrespondents, wisely did not press his contentions in this regard with\r\nany discernible degree of enthusiasm. The appeal\nagainst the\r\nupholding of the second exception in each case must therefore\r\nsucceed.\nMutually Contradictory Averments\r\n('The Third Exception')\n.\n[10]\nThe\r\nthird basis upon which the exception was framed in each case was the\r\nmutually contradictory allegations concerning the current\nownership\r\nof the copyright. In the EMI Music matter, after setting out, in\r\nparas 1 to 12, the claim based on infringement, the\nparticulars\r\ncontain a second claim, not pleaded in the alternative, in which the\r\nappellant relies on the conclusion by Ms Fassie\nof a number of\r\nso-called 'performance agreements'. The claim is that EMI Music\r\nfailed in its obligations, in terms of these agreements,\nto render\r\nregular, accurate and proper accounts of what it had received and\r\nwhat was due to Ms Fassie and her estate. The notice\nof exception\r\nalleged that the appellant's claim, in para 3 of the particulars, to\r\nownership of the copyright and the allegation\nin para 12 that there\r\nwere no licensees of the works was inconsistent with the contention\r\nthat Ms Fassie had entered into what\nwere effectively assignments\r\nand/or licensing agreements. This exception was upheld by the court\r\nbelow but abandoned by EMI Music\nshortly before the appeal was\r\nargued. In the EMI Publishing action the claim for contractual\r\nroyalties was specifically pleaded\nin the alternative to the\r\ninfringement claim. Jajbhay J held that the particulars were vague\r\nand embarrassing and that EMI Publishing\nwas prejudiced thereby\n'more\r\nparticularly in that the defendant is unable to know whether to come\r\nto court to meet a case based on ownership of copyright\nvesting in\r\nthe plaintiff, or to meet a case based on ownership of copyright\r\nvesting in the defendant, and a consequent claim for\nroyalties and a\r\nstatement and debatement of account. These two claims are mutually\r\ndestructive of one another . . .'\n.\n[11]\nIt\r\nis not necessary to refer to authority for the proposition that a\r\nplaintiff is entitled to rely on mutually contradictory averments\nin\r\nhis particulars of claim, provided that it is clear from the manner\r\nof pleading them that he is only relying on the one in the\nevent that\r\nthe other is not sustainable. In this instance one might well have\r\nexpected that the claim based on contract would be\nrelied on as the\r\nmain claim and that the claim for damages would be pleaded in the\r\nalternative, eg in the event of the claim on\ncontract failing. But\r\nthe circumstance that the contractual claim is pleaded in the\r\nalternative to that for infringement damages\ndoes not detract from\r\nthe fact that it is clear to the reader of the particulars that the\r\nclaims are relied upon in the alternative.\nThat the defendant will be\r\nrequired to come to court to meet one of two alternative claims is\r\ncertainly no basis for a finding\nthat the defendant is embarrassed or\r\nprejudiced. This exception should accordingly have been dismissed.\n[12]\tIn the result the appeals\r\nsucceed only insofar as the second and third exceptions are\r\nconcerned.\nMr\r\nLeibowitz\nsubmitted\r\nthat since both parties had had a measure of success in the appeal,\r\nthere should be no order as to the costs in this\ncourt. However, it\r\nwas necessary for the appellant to come to this court to have the\r\nsecond and third exceptions set aside and\non that basis the appellant\r\nshould have the indemnity of a costs order.\n[13]\tIn each case, the following\r\norder is made:\n1.\tThe appeal against the upholding\r\nof the first exception is\ndismissed.\n2.\tSave as is set out in paragraph 1,\r\nthe appeal succeeds.\n3.\tThe respondent is ordered to pay the appellantâs\r\ncosts of appeal, such costs to include the costs of two counsel.\n4.\tThe order of the court below is altered to read:\n(a)\tThe first exception is upheld.\n(b)\tParagraphs 3 to 12 of the particulars of claim are\r\nstruck out.\n(c)\tThe plaintiff is given leave to amend the\r\nparticulars of claim by notice of amendment delivered within 21 days\r\nof the date of\nthis order.\n(d)\tSave as ordered in paragraph (a),\r\nthe exceptions are dismissed.\n(e)\tThe plaintiff is ordered to pay the costs of the\r\nexceptions.\n5.\tThe period of 21 days in para 4(c) is to run from the\r\ndate of delivery of this judgment.\n____________________________\nNV HURT\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances:\nFor Appellant:\nJR\r\nGautschi   SC\nM Smit\nInstructed by:\nFeldman & Nance Kivell\r\nJohannesburg\nLovius Block Bloemfontein\nFor Respondent:\nDavid\r\nLeibowitz\nInstructed by:\nRosin Wright Rosengarten Johannesburg\nClaude Reid Inc Bloemfontein\n1\nIn which Ms Fassie was stated to be the sole\r\n\tcomposer/author of the music and lyrics.\n2\nThis is a précis of the detailed allegations of conduct which\r\n\tconstituted copyright infringement.\n3\n'Where in an action under this section an infringement of copyright\r\n\tis proved or admitted, and the court having regard, in addition\nto\r\n\tall other material considerations, to\n(a)\tthe\r\n\tflagrancy of the infringement; and\n(b)\tany benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant by reason of\r\n\tthe infringement,\nIs\r\n\tsatisfied that effective relief would not otherwise be available to\r\n\tthe plaintiff, the court shall in assessing damages for\ninfringement\r\n\thave power to award such additional damages as the court may deem\r\n\tfit.\n4\nO H Dean\nHandbook of South African Copyright Law\np1-30A; K\r\n\tGarnett, G Davies, G Harbottle\nCopinger and Skone James on\r\n\tCopyright\n15 ed p 288.\n5\n'\nwork of joint authorship\nmeans a work produced by the\r\n\tcollaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of\r\n\teach author is not separable from\nthe contribution of the other\r\n\tauthor or authors'.\n6\nOp cit\npp 287 to 288.\n7\np 467.",

    "facts": "The appellant, David Feldman N.O., acting as executor of the estate of the late singer Brenda Fassie, instituted two separate actions in the Witwatersrand Local Division against EMI Music Publishing (Pty) Ltd and EMI Music (Pty) Ltd. The claims were based on alleged copyright infringement of 157 musical works that were jointly authored by Ms Fassie and other collaborators. The pleadings alleged that the respondents had reproduced, published and adapted the works without licence, received royalties, and that the plaintiff was entitled to damages measured by a reasonable royalty and punitive damages. The pleadings were challenged for vagueness, lack of averments of the plaintiff’s entitlement to the whole royalty, and for not joining the other co‑authors.",
    "issues": "1. Whether a co‑author of a joint work has standing to sue for the full damages arising from infringement without joining the other co‑authors or showing a cession of their rights. 2. Whether the particulars of claim are sufficiently particularised to sustain a claim for damages and an enquiry under s 24(1B) of the Copyright Act. 3. Whether the exceptions raised on the grounds of vagueness and mutually contradictory averments should be upheld.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the Copyright Act 98 of 1978. Section 21(1)(a) provides that ownership of a work of joint authorship vests in the co‑authors, each holding an undivided share unless an agreement states otherwise. Section 24(1A) limits a co‑author’s claim for damages to the proportion of the reasonable royalty to which he is entitled. Section 24(1B) permits an enquiry into the quantum of damages once infringement is proven, but the plaintiff must first establish infringement. An exception must be based on grounds expressly pleaded in the exception; non‑joinder cannot be raised if not mentioned. A plaintiff may plead contradictory averments only if it is clear that they are alternative claims.",
    "application": "The Court held that the first exception was correctly upheld because the pleadings did not contain averments showing the plaintiff’s entitlement to the whole royalty or any cession of the other co‑authors’ rights, limiting his claim to a pro‑rata share. The second and third exceptions, however, were wrongly upheld by the lower court. The Court found that the vagueness objection could not stand once an enquiry under s 24(1B) was available, and that contradictory averments were pleaded as alternatives, not as a basis for embarrassment. Accordingly, the appeal succeeded in setting aside the second and third exceptions.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal dismissed the upholding of the first exception, thereby leaving it in place. The appeal succeeded in overturning the second and third exceptions. The order of the court below was amended: the first exception was upheld; paragraphs 3‑12 of the particulars of claim were struck out; the plaintiff was given 21 days to amend the particulars; all other exceptions were dismissed; the respondent was ordered to pay the appellant’s costs of appeal, including costs of two counsel, and the plaintiff was ordered to pay the costs of the exceptions."
