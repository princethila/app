On 8 November\n2001 he was convicted in the Regional\r\nCourt, Pietersburg (now Polokwane), on 69 counts of fraud, two counts\r\nof forgery and one\ncount of uttering. He was sentenced in November\r\n2001 to a total period of 29 years’ imprisonment, several\r\nsentences to run\nconcurrently such that the effective sentence\r\namounted to 18 years’ imprisonment. Botha had pleaded not\r\nguilty to all the\ncharges. He appealed against all the convictions\r\nand sentences to the North Gauteng High Court.\n[2]      The\r\nappeal was heard by the full bench (Preller and Motata JJ) on 29\r\nNovember 2004 and was effectively\ndismissed on 7 March 2007, save\r\nthat the high court substituted for the 69 counts of fraud only one\r\ncharge of fraud, apparently\nassuming it could do so; upheld the\r\nappeal against one charge of forgery and dismissed the appeal in\r\nrespect of one charge of forgery\nand one of uttering. The effective\r\nperiod of imprisonment was reduced to 12 years. Leave to appeal\r\nagainst conviction and sentence\nwas given by this court. This is\r\neffectively an appeal against the conviction on charges 1 to 71.\n[3]      Both\r\nBotha and the State agree that the combination of 69 counts by the\r\nhigh court into one was\nimpermissible and that an accused is entitled\r\nto be either acquitted or convicted in respect of every charge laid\r\nagainst him or\nher.\nSection 106(4)\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51\nof 1977\nprovides that an accused who pleads to a charge is entitled\r\nto ‘demand that he be acquitted or convicted’.\n[4]     \r\nBotha was not granted bail pending appeal and by the time this appeal\r\nwas heard he had been released\nfrom prison on parole.\n[5]      The\r\n69 charges of fraud were alleged in the charge sheet to have been\r\ncommitted over a period\nfrom October 1996 to May 1999. In respect of\r\ncounts 1 to 63, the charges were that on the dates set out in a\r\nschedule to the charge\nsheet, and at Pietersburg, Botha, in the name\r\nof various business entities also set out in the schedule,\r\nwrongfully, falsely and\nwith the intention to defraud, presented\r\nreturns to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) claiming\r\nrepayment of Value Added\nTax paid to suppliers, also listed in the\r\nschedule, based on false invoices. The amounts claimed were also set\r\nout in the schedule.\nIn misrepresenting that the VAT returns were\r\ntrue, the State alleged, Botha had prejudiced SARS which had accepted\r\nthe returns\nas correct and paid the amounts set out in the schedule,\r\nfor the benefit of Botha.\n[6]     \r\nCounts 64 to 69 were of the same nature save that it was alleged that\r\nthe offences were committed\nin Klerksdorp. All the charges of fraud\r\nwere brought on the basis that Botha was instrumental in the creation\r\nof false invoices\nfor goods or materials supplied to one of the\r\nentities over which he had control; that he had drafted tax returns\r\nclaiming VAT\nrefunds which would be signed by a member of his staff\r\nin the legal practice as the ‘bookkeeper’ (though in fact\r\nnot\none of those who signed was a bookkeeper or knew anything about\r\nthe books); that he would ensure the submission of the returns to\n\nSARS; and that SARS would make the refunds to the entity claiming, to\r\nits prejudice. A number of entities and suppliers were involved.\nNone\r\nof the VAT 201 returns was signed by Botha himself.\n[7]      No\r\npurpose would be served in describing each charge and the entities\r\ninvolved. Suffice it to\nsay that there were some eight businesses\r\nthat allegedly made the claims for VAT refunds over the two year\r\nperiod and five suppliers\nwhose tax invoices were involved. An\r\nexample suffices. The first charge was  that on 31 October 1996,\r\nin the tax period October\n1996, a return was submitted by ‘L\r\nBotha Praktyk’ (Botha’s legal practice) claiming two\r\namounts – R22 000\nand R20 844.47 – in respect of VAT\r\npayments that had been made to ‘Primaforce’. (The\r\ninvoices used in support\nof the claims were those of Bosveld\r\nAutomotive Centre trading as  ‘Primaforce Exhausts\r\nPotgietersrus’, and reflected\nwork done on ‘swaar\r\nvoertuie’ (heavy vehicles such as trucks). ) The other charges\r\nfollow the same pattern.\n[8]      The\r\nevidence of the State before the trial court comprised the testimony\r\nof a tax inspector from\nSARS, Mr A J Vogel, former business\r\nassociates of Botha and several former employees in his practice, all\r\nof whom gave evidence\non their role, at the instance of Botha, in the\r\nsubmission of the VAT returns or the creation of false invoices. The\r\nState produced\neither the original returns (VAT 201 forms) or copies,\r\nVAT input lists, and invoices or copies of them. Botha did not give\r\nevidence\nin his own defence.\n[9]      The\r\ndefences before the trial court and the arguments on appeal are that\r\nthe charge sheet was\ndefective in that the correct name of every\r\nentity which made claims is not given; that Botha’s share or\r\ninvolvement in it\nis not correctly stated; that the evidence is\r\nlargely circumstantial (this is, however, really an attack on the\r\nauthenticity and\nadmissibility of the documentary evidence, to which\r\nI shall return); and that some of the witnesses were not credible,\r\nespecially\nsince two of them had been convicted of fraud for some of\r\nthe offences with which Botha was charged, and were warned against\r\nself-incrimination\nas witnesses in terms of\ns 204\nof the\nCriminal\nProcedure Act, as\nwas one other witness who had not been prosecuted.\n[10]    Much was made\r\nalso about the fact that several documents on which the State relied\r\nhad been found by Vogel\non his desk, and that he did not know who had\r\nput them there (a matter to which I shall return). The gravamen of\r\nthe defence was,\nhowever, that Botha did not know what case he had to\r\nmeet since the charge sheet was inaccurate in many respects. It was\r\nargued\nthus that he had not had a fair trial.\n[11]    It is of course\r\ntrue that an accused is entitled to know exactly what charges he or\r\nshe has to meet, and\nthat a conviction on the basis of a different\r\ncharge that has not been made, either initially or through an\r\namendment during the\ncourse of the trial, would be unfair:\nS v\r\nRosenthal\n1980 (1) SA 65\n(A) at 89D-H. In this case,\r\nhowever, the State did not seek or gain a conviction on any charge\r\nnot set out in the charge sheet,\nincluding the schedules, itself.\r\nBotha’s argument that the schedule was inaccurate in certain\r\nrespects does not go to the\nsubstance of the charges. It goes to the\r\ninformation in the charge sheet which was not actually necessary\r\n(such as the membership\nof some of the entities that made the VAT\r\nreturns). Moreover the charge sheet, including the schedules, can in\r\nmy view be easily\nread and understood. Thus the contention that he\r\ndid not know what case he had to meet cannot be accepted.\n[12]    It should be\r\nstated also that during the course of the trial, which extended over\r\na lengthy period, Botha’s\nlegal representative did not ever\r\nassert that Botha did not know what case he had to meet. The\r\nwitnesses were all cross examined\nat length and it is apparent that\r\nBotha knew exactly what the charges were. He and his legal\r\nrepresentative had access to all the\ndocuments that underlay the\r\ncharges. The defence had also requested, and been given, further\r\nparticulars for the purpose of pleading\nand preparing for trial.\n[13]    Because of the\r\nuse of many documents and the related oral evidence, not generally\r\nled in any particular order,\nthe appeal record is not a model of\r\nclarity. Before the hearing this court requested counsel for Botha\r\nand the State to provide\nschedules indicating which documents in the\r\nrecord were used as evidence in respect of each charge, whether they\r\nwere original\nor copies, and whether they were regarded as admissible\r\nor were contested. A postponement of the hearing was granted to allow\r\ncounsel\nthe required time to provide the schedules requested. The\r\nState provided a schedule timeously. Botha’s counsel produced\r\nthree\nvolumes on the morning of the hearing. We have worked thus on\r\nthe schedule provided by the State which has been checked against\nthe\r\nrecord. The schedule demonstrates that there was both documentary and\r\noral evidence in respect of every charge.  I shall\nrevert to the\r\nissue whether copies of documents suffice.\n[14]    I shall not\r\ndeal with the oral evidence in any detail, nor even mention all the\r\nwitnesses: no oral evidence\nwas led for the defence, and the\r\nextensive cross-examination of each witness by Botha’s legal\r\nrepresentative did not reveal\nany substantive flaw in the State’s\r\nevidence. The trial court found that the witnesses were credible and\r\nthose who were warned\nin terms of\ns 204\nof the Act had given\r\nsatisfactory evidence. There was no argument on appeal that the\r\nevidence was not credible – only that\nit was circumstantial.\r\nThat in itself is hardly a flaw. But in any event, as the ensuing\r\ndiscussion will show, it is untrue that\nthe evidence was mainly\r\ncircumstantial. A host of witnesses testified and identified\r\ndocuments which they said they had signed\nor completed on Botha’s\r\ninstructions. These documents are referred to in the charge sheet.\n[15]    The evidence\r\nled at the trial tells the story of how the alleged frauds were\r\nperpetrated. Vogel, who gave\nevidence first, was a tax inspector in\r\nSARS. While doing random checks on VAT returns he chanced on a return\r\nfrom an entity known\nas Olbo (Pty) Ltd, which seemed to him to be\r\nsuspicious. He arranged a tax inspection with Botha who was\r\nregistered as the representative\nof Olbo. Vogel and a colleague met\r\nBotha at a hotel in Potgietersrus. He also went to the premises of\r\nOlbo but could not establish\nwhat sort of business it ran. He\r\nsubsequently arranged with members of the South African Police\r\nServices to do further inspections\nat Botha’s offices and at\r\nhis home.\n[16]    Vogel and\r\npolice working with him found several copies of VAT returns and of\r\ntax invoices on these inspections,\nand he requested Botha to send him\r\nother documents relating to the VAT claims of a number of businesses\r\nin which Botha had some\ninvolvement. Shortly after that, on returning\r\nto the SARS offices one day, he found a pile of documents on his desk\r\nwhich related\nto the businesses in which Botha was involved,\r\nincluding his legal practice, and he and the police pursued their\r\ninvestigation\nof the VAT claims and payments made. Botha has\r\nquestioned the provenance of the documents that Vogel found on his\r\ndesk. Vogel’s\nresponse to questioning in this regard was that\r\nhe did not know how they had got there and by whom they were\r\ndelivered. But one\ncannot escape the compelling inference that they\r\ncame from Botha himself since he had been asked to provide further\r\ndocuments to\nVogel, and since, as I have said, witnesses testified\r\nabout their roles in the creation of all the documents in question on\r\nBotha’s\ninstructions.\n[17]    Vogel also\r\ntestified about meetings that he had with a Mr K H Dauth and a Mr S\r\nLouwrens, both of whom also\ngave evidence. Vogel obtained statements\r\nfrom them as to their complicity with Botha in making false invoices.\r\nDauth and Louwrens\nwere also charged with fraud and forgery\r\nrespectively, and both had pleaded guilty and been convicted and\r\nsentenced. (They were\nwarned in terms of\ns 204\nof the Act.) The\r\nessence of the evidence was that Louwrens and Dauth, among others,\r\nhad been requested to invoice other businesses\nby Botha. Louwrens\r\nasserted that he had believed that the invoices were genuine and that\r\nhe had been misled by Botha. Botha had\nin fact arranged for a\r\nbusiness in Louwrens’s name to be registered as a VAT vendor.\r\nFor his part in creating false tax invoices\nLouwrens was charged with\r\nsix counts of forgery. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five\r\nyears’ imprisonment followed\nby correctional supervision in\r\nterms of\ns 276(1)(i)\nof the Act.\n[18]    Dauth\r\nacknowledged that he knew that what he was doing was wrong, but said\r\nthat he had, at the time in question,\nbeen an alcoholic and was\r\ndependent on Botha. His business, Prima Force, had ceased to trade;\r\nhe was in dire financial straits\nand he had been willing to create\r\nfalse invoices for work done to vehicles, and for other purposes, at\r\nthe request of Botha. The\ninvoices underpinning the first charge,\r\ndescribed above, were written by Dauth, who knew that they were\r\nfalse, but was willing\nto assist Botha in what he was told were\r\nbookkeeping arrangements. For his role, Dauth was charged with 74\r\ncounts of forgery. He\npleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven\r\nyears’ imprisonment which was suspended for four years.\n[19]    The other\r\nwitness warned in terms of\ns 204\nwas Ms C F Peuckert, who was\r\nemployed in Botha’s practice. She too had given a statement to\r\nVogel about the false returns\nshe had signed on Botha’s\r\ninstructions. She had spent several days, after Vogel first began\r\ninvestigating Botha, sorting\nout papers, compiling files of invoices,\r\nand typing ‘input lists’ for VAT refunds, all from\r\nmaterial that had been\ngiven to her by Botha. Peuckert testified that\r\nshe had been instructed by Botha to take the computer on which she\r\nworked home and\nto destroy the data on it. She had, however, copied\r\nfiles from the computer to stiffie disks and handed them to the\r\npolice.\n[20]    Peuckert also\r\ntestified that Botha had gone to Namibia, apparently with the\r\nintention of evading a trial,\nand had summoned her to meet him there\r\non the pretext that she too might be charged and should leave the\r\ncountry. She had indeed\ngone to Namibia but returned to South Africa\r\nwhen she realized that Botha’s reason for summoning her was to\r\ncontinue a sexual\nrelationship with her and not to protect her from\r\nprosecution.\n[21]    Another\r\nemployee in the practice, Mrs Smith (Engelbrecht when she gave\r\nevidence) testified that she had filled\nout tax invoices on Botha’s\r\ninstructions (all on the same day) in respect of a business known as\r\nBasson and Sons, and had\nalso signed VAT returns in the capacity as\r\nbookkeeper although she was not one.\n[22]    Charges 70 and\r\n71 (the trial court did not convict Botha in respect of charge 73,\r\nand the high court upheld\nBotha’s appeal on charge 72) are for\r\nforgery and uttering respectively. They relate to an attorney, whose\r\ntax invoice book\nBotha allegedly took when on a visit to Van\r\nNiekerk’s offices.  Van Niekerk’s testimony and\r\ndocuments adduced\nby the State showed that invoice pages were removed\r\nfrom the book, and filled in by Botha, reflecting payments payable to\r\nhim for\nwork done for a number of clients, none of which was genuine.\r\nThe invoices were found in Botha’s offices. Only one invoice\n\nwas sent to SARS, however, hence the one conviction for uttering and\r\ntwo for forgery.\n[23]    Botha’s\r\nsignature did not appear on any of the documents adduced by the\r\nState, although some had been\npartially completed by him. But in my\r\nview, the evidence that he instructed other people to fill in false\r\ntax invoices and submit\nsigned VAT returns to SARS, to its prejudice\r\nand for his benefit, is overwhelming. There are documents that\r\nsupport each charge,\nand the State witnesses testified as to who\r\nfilled in tax invoices, completed VAT 201 returns, and the reasons\r\nfor doing so: Botha\nhad instructed them so to do.\n[24]    Moreover, the\r\ndocuments speak for themselves in so far as falsity is concerned. No\r\nexplanation was proffered\nas to why Prima Force, for example, would\r\ndo extensive and costly work on trucks for an attorney’s\r\npractice.  Nor was\nthere an explanation why a furniture dealer\r\n(Basson and Sons) sold wild animals to a farm on land that could not\r\nbe traced. These\nare random examples of the kinds of claims that were\r\nmade on Botha’s instructions.\n[25]    The input tax\r\nstatements generated in Botha’s office also tell a story.\r\nAgain, a random example illustrates\nthis: for the period December\r\n1996 to January 1997, the claims for repayment of VAT in respect of\r\nBotha’s practice each amounted\nto less than R30 (some for just\r\n98 cents) except for two – claims in respect of moneys paid to\r\nBosveld Automotive Centre\n(Prima Force), one for repayment of R23 000\r\n(the charge for the work being R187 285.71) and the other for R24\r\n179.33 (the charge\nfor the work by Bosveld Automotive Centre being\r\nR196 888.83).\n[26]    And as the\r\ntrial court said, Botha chose his people well: he ensured that those\r\nwhom he requested to fill\nin tax invoices or sign VAT returns were in\r\nsome way dependent on him: friends who were in dire economic straits\r\nlike Dauth, and \nemployees who would obey his instructions\r\nwithout demur. Another significant aspect is that all the businesses\r\ndealt with each\nother, rendering or receiving goods and services. And\r\nseveral individuals, like Louwrens, were involved in different\r\ncapacities\nin several of the transactions that facilitated the\r\nfrauds. The pattern repeated itself with different friends and\r\ndifferent employees,\nbut in every case it was Botha who orchestrated\r\nthe making of false representations to SARS with intent to defraud,\r\nto their prejudice\nand to his benefit.\n[27]    For each charge\r\nthe State adduced documentary proof, sometimes the original documents\r\nand sometimes copies.\nBotha’s legal representative in the trial\r\nargued at length that no reliance could be placed on copies. But no\r\nevidence was\nadduced by him to show that they were not authentic\r\ncopies. And since many of the documents were computer-generated it\r\ncannot be\nsaid that the documents were not the originals. While\r\nclearly it is preferable for original documents to be produced as\r\nevidence,\nwhere this is not possible or practicable, there is no\r\nreason, in the absence of countervailing evidence as to its lack of\r\nauthenticity,\nnot to accept it as the best evidence available.\r\nMoreover, several witnesses testified as to the handwriting on\r\nvarious documents\n– whether their own or Botha’s –\r\nand none of this evidence was countered. I see no reason not to\r\naccept the authenticity\nof the copies of tax returns or invoices\r\nintroduced in evidence by the State.\n[28]    The argument\r\nfor Botha on appeal was thus reduced to one that he did not know what\r\ncase he had to meet at\nthe trial. As I have said, that is plainly not\r\nthe case. He would have known from the charge sheet exactly when and\r\nwhere each\nfraud was allegedly committed, which entities were\r\ninvolved and the sums involved. He had provided many of the documents\r\nhimself\nand had filled in parts of some. The oral evidence of those\r\nwho had been instrumental in committing the frauds also came as no\r\nsurprise to him for they had made statements to the police at the\r\noutset of the investigation and all this evidence was disclosed\nto\r\nhim. That the State made inaccurate statements as to the nature of a\r\nbusiness entity (whether it was a close corporation or\na company, for\r\nexample) or as to the interests in the various entities, is\r\nirrelevant. All the elements of the frauds committed\nby Botha –\r\nunlawfully making false representations with the intent to deceive,\r\nto the prejudice of SARS – were alleged\nand proved beyond\r\nreasonable doubt.\n[29]    In my view\r\nBotha was correctly convicted on 71 charges by the trial court. \r\nThe high court’s judgment\non appeal must thus be set aside.\r\nThat leaves the question of sentence. Botha does not appeal against\r\nthe sentence imposed by the\nhigh court, effectively twelve years’\r\nimprisonment, and the State has not argued strenuously that the\r\nreduction to 12 years’\nimprisonment was unjustified.\n[30]    In the\r\ncircumstances it is not improper to impose only one sentence in\r\nrespect of all the convictions, and\nsince there is no appeal against\r\nit, it should be left as it stands.\n[31]\n1 The appeal is successful only to the\r\nextent that the substitution by the high court of convictions on 69\r\ncharges of fraud with\na conviction on one charge of fraud is set\r\naside.\n2 The order of the high court is\r\naltered to read as follows:\n‘\n(a)\r\nSave that the conviction on charge 72 is set aside, the appeal is\r\ndismissed.\n(b) The appeal against sentence is\r\nupheld. The sentence is set aside and replaced with a sentence of\r\ntwelve years’ imprisonment.\n(c) This sentence is deemed to have\r\ncommenced on 15 November 2001.’\nC H Lewis\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor Appellant:\nD Bisschoff\nInstructed by:\nJ L Botha\nMokopane\nSaffy &\r\n\t\t\tAssociates\nBloemfontein\nFor Respondent:\nJ H T Schutte\nInstructed\r\n\t\t\tby:\nDirector\r\n\t\t\tof Public Prosecutions\nPretoria\nDirector\r\n\t\t\tof Public Prosecutions\nBloemfontein",

    "facts": "Jacob Louis Botha, an attorney practicing in Potgietersrus, was charged with a large-scale VAT fraud scheme. The charge sheet listed 69 counts of fraud alleged to have been committed between October 1996 and May 1999, two counts of forgery and one count of uttering. The fraud involved the preparation of false VAT returns and invoices for a number of entities, resulting in unlawful refunds from the South African Revenue Service (SARS). Botha was convicted in the Regional Court in November 2001 on all 71 charges and sentenced to a total of 29 years imprisonment, effectively 18 years, later reduced on appeal to 12 years. Evidence presented by the State included testimony from a SARS tax inspector and numerous documents – original returns, copies, invoices and input tax lists – many of which were computer‑generated. Botha did not testify and alleged that inaccuracies in the charge sheet meant he did not know the case he had to meet.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised three principal issues: (1) whether minor inaccuracies in the charge sheet deprive an accused of fair notice of the case to meet; (2) whether the High Court was authorised to substitute 69 separate fraud convictions with a single conviction; and (3) whether copies of documentary evidence could be admitted as best evidence in the absence of the originals.",
    "principles": "The Court relied on Section 106(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which guarantees an accused the right to be convicted of each specific charge. It also applied the principle from S v Rosenthal that an accused must be given clear notice of the charges, but noted that inaccuracies that do not affect the substantive nature of the charge are not fatal. Regarding evidence, the Court affirmed that while original documents are preferred, copies are admissible as best evidence where authenticity is not successfully challenged, especially where documents are computer‑generated.",
    "application": "The Court found that the schedule in the charge sheet, though containing some factual errors (e.g., incorrect entity types), still conveyed the essential nature of each fraud charge, and Botha had full access to the documents and was aware of the allegations. Consequently, the argument that he did not know the case was rejected. The substitution of 69 fraud convictions with a single conviction was held to be impermissible because the accused is entitled to be convicted on each charge laid. The Court also concluded that the copies of VAT returns and invoices presented by the State were admissible, as no credible evidence was raised to dispute their authenticity.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded in setting aside the High Court’s substitution of the 69 fraud convictions with one conviction. All original convictions (71 charges) were reinstated. The sentence of twelve years’ imprisonment, imposed by the High Court, was upheld and deemed to have commenced on 15 November 2001."
