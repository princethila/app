Puma sought relief by way of an\r\ninterdict and damages calculated on a notional royalty\nbasis. The\r\nhigh court, after hearing evidence, dismissed the claim with costs.\r\nThe appeal is with the leave of this court.\n[2]\tPuma\r\nrelied on\ns 34(1)(a)\nof the\nTrade Marks Act 194 of 1993\n, which\r\nprovides that the rights acquired by registration of a trade mark are\r\ninfringed by the unauthorized use in the course of\ntrade in relation\r\nto goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is\r\nregistered, of an identical mark or of a mark so nearly\nresembling it\r\nas to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\n[3]\tThe\r\nissues on infringement are limited particularly because the two trade\r\nmark registrations were not impinged. Both are registered\nin class 25\r\nfor footwear of all types and descriptions, and for clothing. Their\r\nparticulars are these:\nThe first mark, TM\r\n\t1980/05551, consists of a device described in the admissions section\r\n\tof the registration certificate as a âtapering\nstripe on the side\r\n\tof the shoe or boot as depictedâ. It runs from the upper portion\r\n\tof the heel to meet the sole at the middle\nof the shoe. The stripe\r\n\tcontains two dotted lines that follow its curvature. They appear to\r\n\tconsist of or be in the form of stitching.\n A disclaimer states that\r\n\tthe registration gives no right to the exclusive use of the stylised\r\n\tshoes as depicted by means of\ndotted lines. The word PUMA appears\r\n\tabove the stripe. PUMA is an associated word mark held under TM\r\n\t78/05750. A representation\nof this mark is attached.\nThe second, TM\r\n\t1982/04607, consists of a similar device but differs from the first\r\n\tmark in the following respects: the device\nis not limited to use on\r\n\tthe side of a shoe; it is of one colour and there are no dotted\r\n\tlines; and there is a blank space in\nthe tapering stripe close to\r\n\tits widest end. The registration contains an undertaking by Puma\r\n\tthat, in use, the blank space appearing\nin the mark will be occupied\r\n\tonly by matter of descriptive or non-distinctive character, or by a\r\n\tregistered trade mark, or it\nwill be left blank. Another difference\r\n\tbetween the marks is that the name mark PUMA does not form part of\r\n\tthe registered mark.\nBecause of the poor quality of the photocopies\r\n\tin the record the attached representation of the mark does not\r\n\treflect the blank\nspace.\n[4]\tGlobal\r\nis in the business of having shoes made for it on order, and\r\nmarketing them. A photograph of the shoe with the alleged\ninfringing\r\nmark is attached to this judgment. The words âDT NEW YORKâ appear\r\non the tongue and the side of the shoe. A stripe\nruns from the heel.\r\nThe stripe tapers slightly and then splits in two with a distinct\r\nintruding section, more or less like an inverted\nthumb, in a\r\ncontrasting colour. One leg has a curve in the direction of the heel.\r\nThere are, as in the first registration, dotted\nlines but whether\r\nthey are, in the light of the disclaimer, to be discounted for\r\npurposes of determining infringement was not argued\nand need not be\r\ndecided.\n[5]\tThe\r\nfirst question that springs to mind is this: what is Globalâs trade\r\nmark as represented on the shoe? I would have thought\nthat it is DT\r\nNEW YORK. Pumaâs counsel argued otherwise because, he said, these\r\nwords are meaningless. Trade marks more often\nthan not are\r\nobjectively meaningless (because if they have a meaning they may be\r\ndescriptive) but that does not mean that they\ncannot be badges of\r\norigin or source identifiers even if they do not disclose the source.\n[6]\tThe\r\nsecond question that springs to mind is whether the stripe on\r\nGlobalâs shoe, which is not substantially the same as the\nmarks in\r\nissue, would have been perceived by the purchasing public as a source\r\nidentifier or as an adornment.\n1\nSince counsel did not\r\naddress the issue squarely it is not necessary to consider this\r\nquestion or the effect of the recent judgment\nof the European Court\r\nof Justice in the\nAdidas\ncase where the\r\nissue was whether the use of two stripes on sportswear could infringe\r\nAdidasâs three-stripe motif trade mark or\nwhether it would have\r\nbeen perceived as a mere adornment.\n2\n[7]\tIf\r\nGlobalâs stripe has trade mark significance, as Puma contends,\r\nregard must be had to the whole of its mark, which consists\nof the\r\nstripe with the name, to determine whether\nit\r\nso nearly resembles any of Pumaâs marks as to be likely to deceive\r\nor cause confusion. Once that is recognized, Pumaâs reliance\nof the\r\nfirst registration is doomed because of the prominence on the name\r\nPUMA.\n[8]\tThat\r\nbrings me to a consideration of the second registration. The trial\r\ncourt relied on\nCowbell\n3\nfor the proposition that the decision about the likelihood of\r\nconfusion or deception involves a value judgment; that a global\r\nappreciation is required; that regard must be given to the overall\r\nimpression given by the marks; and that registered trade marks\ndo not\r\ncreate monopolies in relation to concepts or ideas. The court also\r\nhad regard to the factors set out in\nPlascon\r\nEvans\nthat have to be taken into\r\naccount in determining the question whether there is a probability or\r\nlikelihood of confusion.\n4\nIt held that the average consumer would have had regard to the fact\r\nthat DT NEW YORK was part of the trade mark and would have\nnoted that\r\nthe two stripes are significantly different and, consequently, that\r\nGlobalâs mark was not confusingly or deceptively\nsimilar.\n[9]\tAs\r\ncounsel for Puma reminded us, the question of the likelihood of\r\nconfusion or deception is a matter of first impression and\nthat one\r\nshould not peer too closely at the registered mark and the alleged\r\ninfringement to find similarities and differences.\n5\nAs a matter of first impression I came to the same conclusion as did\r\nthe trial court. Argument did not convince me to the contrary,\nand in\r\nmy view the trial court was correct in its eventual judgment.\n[10]\tThe\r\ncourt did, however, have regard to matters that were not permissible\r\nto consider. These included the fact that the mark\non Globalâs\r\npackaging differed from that used on the shoe; that Puma after\r\ninstituting action in this case applied for registration\nof a trade\r\nmark that approximated Globalâs stripe; and that Puma did not\r\nproduce in evidence, as it undertook to do, a shoe with\neither of\r\nthese trade marks. These factors might have been relevant in a\r\npassing-off situation but they are not in a trade mark\ninfringement\r\ncase which requires an objective comparison between the registration\r\nand the defendantâs actual use.\n[11]\tThe\r\nfact that the test is objective impinges on another aspect of Pumaâs\r\ncase. It sought to rely on the subjective intention\nof Global in\r\nadopting the stripe to support a finding of infringement. The first\r\nproblem with the argument concerns the evidence.\nGlobal sought to\r\nproduce a shoe that approximated the Puma Sprint shoe without\r\ninfringing its trade marks. The photograph of the\nSprint shoe, as\r\nreproduced in the record, does not appear to bear either of the two\r\nregistered marks in issue although it could\nbe considered to be an\r\nadaptation of the first mark. In any event, there are other aspects\r\nto the argument. The first is that the\nintention to compete must not\r\nbe confused with the intention to mislead.\n6\nThe second is that the subjective intention of a defendant could\r\nhardly assist in deciding the objective question of the likelihood\nof\r\ndeception or confusion. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in\nAdvantage\r\nGroup Ltd v ADV E-Commerce Ltd\n[2002]\r\nNZCA 282\nquoted in this regard\nMcCarthy\r\non Trademarks and Unfair Competition\n(4\r\ned), para 13.22 with approval:\nâ\nAlmost all of the\r\nmodern decisions have shifted the emphasis away from the defendant's\r\nsubjective mental state, and have placed\nprime importance upon the\r\nissue of likelihood of confusion and consequent consumer deception.\r\nThat is, the objective facts of probable\ncustomer confusion are more\r\nimportant than trying to determine what was going on in the\r\ndefendant's mind.â\nOne\r\ncould test the proposition by asking whether the intention of a\r\ndefendant not to confuse or deceive could assist in a defence\nof\r\nnon-infringement. The answer must be in the negative because as an\r\nArizona court quoted by McCarthy has said: âBoth the first\nuser and\r\nthe public may be as readily wounded by the ostrich as the fox.â\n7\n[12]\tThe\r\ncourt below, unnecessarily, expressed a view about Pumaâs claim for\r\na notional royalty, stating that the claim could\nnot have succeeded\r\nin the absence of proof of actual loss. In this regard the court\r\nerred. The object of permitting a claim for\ndamages in the form of\r\nnotional royalties is to obviate proof of actual loss, something\r\nextremely difficult to establish in intellectual\nproperty\r\ninfringement cases. As Learned Hand J explained,\n8\nâ\nThe\r\nwhole notion of a reasonable royalty is a device in aid of justice,\r\nby which that which is really incalculable shall be approximated,\n\nrather than that the patentee, who has suffered an indubitable wrong,\r\nshall be dismissed with empty hands.â\nAll a\r\nclaimant has to prove is the number of infringing articles and the\r\nreasonable royalty rate.\n9\n[13]\tIt\r\nfollows that the appeal stands to be dismissed and the appeal is\r\naccordingly dismissed with costs.\n_____________________\nL T C HARMS\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\nFor\r\n\tAppellant:\tC Puckrin SC\nI Joubert\nInstructed by:\tAdams &\r\n\tAdams\nPretoria\nHoney Attorneys\nBloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent:\tJ Newdigate SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\tFairbridges\nCape Town\nMcIntyre\r\n& Van Der Post\nBloemfontein\n80/05551\nGlobal\r\nshoe\n1\nVerimark (Pty) Ltd v\r\n\tBayerische Motoren Werke AktienGesellschaft; Bayerische Motoren\r\n\tWerke AktienGesellschaft v Verimark (Pty)\nLtd\n[2007] ZASCA 53\n; [2007] SCA 53 (RSA);\n2007 (6) SA 263\n(SCA) para 5.\r\n\tSee also the discussion in\nBergkelder\r\n\tBpk v Vredendal KoÃ¶p Wynmakery\n(105/05)\n[2006] ZASCA 5\n;\n2006 (4) SA 275\n(SCA); [2006] SCA 8 (RSA)\r\n\tpara 8;\nLubbe NO v\r\n\tMillenium Style (Pty) Ltd\n[2007] ZASCA 10\n; [2007] SCA 10;\n[2007] 4 All SA 692\n(SCA);\n2007 (6)\r\n\tSA 241\n(SCA) para 9.\n2\nAdidas AG\r\n\t(Approximation of laws)\n[2008] EUECJ C-102/07\n(10 April 2008)\n[Adidas AG v Marca Mode CV\n].\n3\nCowbell AG v ICS Holdings\r\n\tLtd\n[2001] ZASCA\r\n\t18\n;\n2001 (3) SA 941\n;\n[2001] 4 All SA 242\n(SCA) para 10.\n4\nPlascon-Evans Paints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd\n1984 (3) SA 623 (A) 640G-641E, 642D-F.\n5\nLaboratoire Lachartre SA v Armour-Dial Inc\n1976 (2) SA 744 (T)\r\n\t746B-F.\n6\nReckitt & Colman SA (Pty) Ltd v SC Johnson & Son SA (Pty)\r\n\tLtd\n1993 (2) SA 307 (A) 318A-C.\n7\nV J Doyle Plumbing\r\n\tCo v Doyle\n120\r\n\tAriz 130\n(Ct App 1978).\n8\nCincinatti Car Co v New York Rapid Transport\r\n\tCorp\n66 F2d 592.\n9\nBut see the reservations expressed in\nReed\r\n\tExecutive Plc & Ors v Reed Business Information Ltd\n&\r\n\tOrs\n[2004] EWCA Civ 159\npara 165-169.",

    "facts": "Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport sued Global Warming (Pty) Ltd for alleged trade‑mark infringement. Puma owned two registered marks (TM 1980/05551 and TM 1982/04607) covering footwear and clothing. Global Warming produced shoes bearing the words “DT NEW YORK” and a distinctive striped design on the side of the shoe. The High Court heard evidence, found no infringement, and dismissed Puma’s claim with costs. Puma appealed the decision.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two principal issues: (1) whether Global Warming’s striped design together with the “DT NEW YORK” wording infringed either of Puma’s registered marks under s34(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act 194 of 1993; and (2) whether the stripe constituted a trade‑mark capable of causing confusion or was merely an ornamental feature. A subsidiary issue concerned the validity of a claim for damages on a notional royalty basis.",
    "principles": "The court applied the objective test of likelihood of confusion contained in s34(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, emphasizing that infringement depends on whether the marks are identical or so similar as to deceive the average consumer. Precedents cited include Cowbell AG v ICS Holdings Ltd, Plascon‑Evans Paints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd, the European Court of Justice decision in the Adidas case, and the New Zealand ruling in Advantage Group Ltd v ADV E‑Commerce Ltd, all reaffirming that the assessment must be objective and based on the overall impression of the marks, not on the defendant’s subjective intention. The court also noted that notional royalty damages are permissible to avoid the need for proof of actual loss.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that Global Warming’s stripe differed materially from Puma’s registered designs and was not likely to be perceived by the public as a source identifier. The presence of the “DT NEW YORK” wording further distinguished the marks. The court rejected Puma’s reliance on subjective intent and on the alleged decorative nature of the stripe. It also corrected the lower court’s consideration of impermissible factors such as differences in packaging and subsequent registration attempts by Puma. Consequently, the court concluded that no infringement occurred and that the claim for notional royalties was unnecessary.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The High Court’s judgment that there was no trade‑mark infringement was upheld."
