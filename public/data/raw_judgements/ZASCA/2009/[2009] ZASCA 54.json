The high court decided\n\nthe case on the basis of a stated case agreed to by the parties. It\r\nwill be convenient to refer to the parties as they were referred\nto\r\nin the court below â the appellants were the defendants and the\r\nrespondent was the plaintiff.\n[2]\tThe plaintiff was married to one Bruce Francis (âthe\r\ndeceasedâ) who was killed in a motor vehicle collision on 9 October\n\n1998 giving rise to a third party claim by the plaintiff for damages\r\nfor loss of support against the Road Accident Fund (âthe\nFundâ)\r\nunder the Road Accident Fund Act 56 of 1956. The plaintiff instructed\r\nthe defendants, who are attorneys, to pursue her\nclaim against the\r\nFund. They accepted the instruction and lodged the claim but failed\r\nto issue summons timeously. The claim thus\nbecame prescribed and the\r\nplaintiff sued the defendants for professional negligence. Her claim\r\nagainst the defendants was for R850 000\nâ the amount that the\r\nparties agreed she would have been entitled to recover from the Fund\r\nfor her loss of support had the defendants\nnot caused her claim to\r\nbecome prescribed.\n[3]\tThe deceased was employed at Douglas Colliery\r\nServices Limited (âDouglas Collieryâ). In terms of his employment\r\ncontract\nwith Douglas Colliery he was (and on his death his\r\ndependants were) entitled to benefits under an insurance policy known\r\nas a Commuting\nJourney Policy (âthe CJPâ) issued by Rand Mutual\r\nAssurance Company Limited (âRand Mutualâ). It is common cause\r\nthat, the\nplaintiff became entitled to payment of a pension of\r\nR695 525 from Rand Mutual in terms of the CJP arising from the\r\ndeath\nof the deceased, and that the pension is indeed being paid to\r\nher. (The figure comprises both the amounts which the plaintiff has\n\nreceived in the form of monthly pension payments, and the capitalised\r\nvalue of future payments.) Had the defendants pursued the\nplaintiffâs\r\nclaim against the Fund, the Fund would not have been entitled to\r\nbring this amount into account as it was âfor\nloss of support as a\r\nresult of a personâs death (and constituted) insurance money,\r\npension or benefitâ as envisaged in\ns 1(1)\nof the\nAssessment\nof Damages Act 9\nof 1969 (âthe Assessment Actâ), which the Fund,\r\nin terms of the section, would have been precluded from deducting\r\nfrom its\noverall liability. However, in terms of the CJP the\r\nplaintiff would have been obliged to pay Rand Mutual out of the\r\namount received\nfrom the Fund to the extent of the benefit payable by\r\nRand Mutual in terms of the CJP.\n[4]\tSo, had the defendants pursued the claim against the\r\nFund on the plaintiffâs behalf they would have recovered R850 000\n\nin respect of the plaintiffâs loss of support from the Fund. She\r\nwould have had to pay R695 525 to Rand Mutual, retaining\na\r\nbalance of R154 475 and would have continued to receive the CJP\r\npension. She would thus, in effect, have received a total\nof R850 000\r\ncomprised of her monthly CJP pension to the value of R695 525\r\nand the R154 475 that she would have retained\nout of her claim\r\nagainst the Fund.\n[5]\tThe defendants contended that the plaintiff would\r\nnot be obliged to indemnify Rand Mutual to any extent out of damages\r\nrecovered\nfrom them with the result that she suffered damages in an\r\namount of R154 475 and not R850 000 as a result of their\r\nnegligence.\nShould they be ordered to pay R850 000 to the\r\nplaintiff, she would be R695 525 better off than she would have\r\nbeen had\nthey not allowed her claim to become prescribed. The\r\nplaintiff on the other hand contended that, in terms of the CJP she\r\nis obliged\nto indemnify Rand Mutual out of damages recovered from any\r\nthird party to the extent of the benefit payable by Rand Mutual in\r\nterms\nof the policy. In the alternative she contended that her claim\r\nagainst the defendants is a claim for loss of support as a result\nof\r\nthe death of her husband and that in terms of\ns 1\nof the\nAssessment of Damages Act 9 of 1969\nthe insurance money payable to\r\nher may not be taken into account in assessing her damages claimed\r\nfrom the defendants. Consequently\nthe stated case posed the following\r\nquestions for determination by the high court:\nâ\nThe Court is asked to\r\nadjudicate upon the effect of the Plaintiffâs receipt of benefits\r\nin terms of the CJP upon the Defendantsâ\nliability to the Plaintiff\r\narising out of the prescription of her claim against the Fund. More\r\nin particular, the Court is asked\nto determine:\n(a)\tWhether the defendants were\r\nâthird partiesâ as defined in Condition 8 of the CJP.\n(b)\tIf not, whether the\r\nplaintiffâs claim against the defendants fell to be reduced by the\r\namount which the plaintiff would have\nhad to repay to Rand Mutual,\r\nand which she was no longer obliged to.â\nIn answering the second question the high court was\r\nasked to determine whether the provisions of s 1 of the\r\nAssessment Act\napplied to the plaintiffâs claim against the\r\ndefendants.\n[6]\tIt appeared to the parties that if either question\r\nwas answered affirmatively the plaintiff would be entitled to the\r\nfull amount\nof R850 000 without having to deduct the R695 525.\r\nOn the other hand, if the second question was resolved in favour of\n\nthe defendants, in other words that the Assessment Act did not apply\r\nto the plaintiffâs claim, the parties were under the impression\n\nthat the defendantsâ liability of R850 00 would be reduced by\r\nR695 525 to R154 475. The high court decided the\nfirst\r\nquestion against the plaintiff but the second in her favour. This\r\nmeant that the defendants could not deduct the value of\nthe pension\r\nfrom the computation of the plaintiffâs damages and were thus\r\nliable to the plaintiff for the full amount of R850 000.\nThe\r\ndefendants appealed against this finding.\n[7]\tI turn to consider the first question â whether\r\nthe defendants are âthird partiesâ as envisaged in Condition 8 of\r\nthe\nCJP. It reads thus:\nâ\nWhere the accident in respect\r\nof which a benefit is payable was caused under circumstances creating\r\na legal liability in some person\nother than the Insured (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the Third Party) to pay damages to the Insured Person\r\nor to his dependants in\nrespect thereof, the Insurer shall be\r\nentitled to be indemnified by the Insured Person or by his\r\ndependants, as the case may be,\nout of any damages recovered from the\r\nthird party, to the extent of any benefit payable by the Insurer in\r\nterms of this policy\n. . .â\n[8]\tThe plaintiff contended in the high court, as she\r\ndid before us, that the cause of the plaintiffâs claim was the\r\naccident.\nAs such, so the contention went, the court should give\r\neffect to the true intention of the parties by interpreting the\r\ncondition\nso as to include the defendants within the ambit of the\r\nmeaning of âthe Third Partyâ. The high court observed that the\r\nclear\nterms of the condition applied only to a claim that arose from\r\nan accident and because, the court reasoned, the legal liability\nof\r\nthe defendants was caused not by the accident but by the prescription\r\nof the claim, the defendants were not third parties envisaged\nin the\r\nCJP. In my view the courtâs reasoning on this aspect cannot be\r\nfaulted.\n[9]\tI turn to the second issue namely whether the\r\nAssessment Act applied to the plaintiffâs claim.  Section 1 of the\r\nAssessment\nAct provides as follows:\nâ\n(1)\tWhen\r\nin any action, the cause of which arose after the commencement of\r\nthis Act, damages are assessed for loss of support as\na result of a\r\nperson's death, no insurance money, pension or benefit which has been\r\nor will or may be paid as a result of the deat\nh,\r\nshall be taken into account.\n(2)\tFor the\r\npurposes of subsection (1) â\nâ\nbenefitâ\r\nmeans any payment by a friendly society or trade union for the relief\r\nor maintenance of a member's dependants;\nâ\ninsurance\r\nmoneyâ includes a refund of premiums and any payment of interest on\r\nsuch premiums;\nâ\npensionâ\r\nincludes a refund of contributions and any payment of interest on\r\nsuch contributions, and also any payment of a gratuity\nor other lump\r\nsum by a pension or provident fund or by an employer in respect of a\r\nperson's employment.â\n[10]\tThe defendants contended in the high court, as they\r\ndo now, that the Assessment Act, in its terms, applies only to\r\nactions\nin which damages are assessed for loss of support, which the\r\nplaintiffâs action against the Fund is. And, so they contended,\r\nbecause the plaintiffâs action against the defendants is not one\r\nfor loss of support, but for loss of her claim against the Fund,\nthe\r\nAssessment Act did not apply to her claim against them.\n[11]\tThe high court rejected this contention. In so\r\ndoing, it reasoned that even though the plaintiffâs cause of action\r\nagainst\nthe Fund differed from its action against the defendants, her\r\nclaim, that is, her right of action against them was essentially the\n\nsame â they both related to damages for loss of support as a result\r\nof the death of the deceased.\n[12]\tClaims for loss of support on the one hand and for\r\nprofessional negligence on the other differ. In the former case what\r\nis\nbeing compensated is the loss of support; in the case of the\r\nlatter it is the lost opportunity for recovering that loss. The\r\nclaims\nare conceptually different. Section 1(1) of the Assessment Act\r\napplies only to actions in which damages are to be assessed for loss\n\nof support as a result of a personâs death. In the present action\r\ndamages are not to be assessed for loss of support. The damages\nthat\r\nare to be assessed are the damages suffered by the plaintiff as a\r\nresult of the negligence of the defendants in having allowed\nher\r\nclaim for loss of support against the Fund to become prescribed. The\r\nfact that the damages suffered by the plaintiff may be\nthe same as\r\nthe amount of her loss of support and the fact that such damages have\r\nto be determined by reference to her loss of\nsupport do not make the\r\npresent action an action in which âdamages are assessed for loss of\r\nsupportâ.\n[13]\tIn light of the fact that the plaintiff is not in\r\nterms of the CJP obliged to indemnify Rand Mutual out of damages\r\nrecovered\nfrom the defendants and the fact that the value of the\r\nbenefit payable by Rand Mutual is not to be excluded from the\r\ncomputation\nof the damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of\r\nthe defendantsâ negligence, the defendants submitted that the\r\ndamages\nsuffered by the plaintiff as a result of their negligence\r\namounted to R154 475 and not R850 000 as claimed by her.\n[14]\tHowever, it does not follow that because s 1(1)\r\nof the Assessment Act does not apply the plaintiffâs claim against\r\nthe\ndefendants falls to be reduced by the amount which the plaintiff\r\nwould have had to repay to Rand Mutual. The question arises whether,\n\nat common law, the benefit payable to the plaintiff in terms of the\r\nCJP should not be disregarded when determining the damages\nsuffered\r\nby the plaintiff as a result of the defendantsâ negligence. Because\r\nof the conclusion the high court had arrived at\nit was not necessary\r\nto pursue this inquiry and during their oral submissions before this\r\ncourt neither party dealt with this question\nsatisfactorily.\n[15]\tSo the parties were invited to make further written\r\nsubmissions. In particular they were requested to deal with whether\r\nthe\nbenefit payable by Rand Mutual was collateral to the plaintiffâs\r\nright of action according to the principle\nres\r\ninter alios acta\n,\naliis\r\nneque nocet\n,\nneque\r\nprodest\n(âa thing done, or a transaction\r\nentered into, between certain parties cannot advantage or injure\r\nthose who are not parties to\nthe act or transactionâ) and had to be\r\ndisregarded in computing the plaintiffâs damages. The parties were\r\nalso asked to deal\nwith the question whether Rand Mutual should have\r\nbeen joined in the proceedings before the high court. Since then Rand\r\nMutual\nhas indicated that it waived its right to be joined as a party\r\nand that it considers itself bound by this courtâs decision and\nso\r\nthe answer to this question fell away. It remains to deal with the\r\nquestion whether the pension benefit that Rand Mutual paid\nto the\r\nplaintiff was a collateral benefit which had to be disregarded in\r\ncomputing the damages suffered by her as a result of the\ndefendantsâ\r\nnegligence.\n[16]\tAs a general rule the patrimonial delictual damages\r\nsuffered by a plaintiff is the difference between his patrimony\r\nbefore\nand after the commission of the delict. In determining a\r\nplaintiffâs patrimony after the commission of the delict\r\nadvantageous\nconsequences have to be taken into account. But it has\r\nbeen recognised that there are exceptions to this general rule.\r\nVarious\nattempts to formulate a legal principle as to which benefits\r\nshould be taken into account have been made. In\nStandard\r\nGeneral Insurance Co Ltd v Dugmore NO\n1997\r\n(1) SA 33\nat 41E-42E Olivier JA referred to these attempts and\r\nconcluded:\nâ\nBoberg (\nThe\r\nLaw of Delict\nvol 1\r\nat 479) succinctly states:\nâ\nThe existence of the\r\ncollateral source rule can therefore not be doubted; to what benefit\r\nit applies is determined casuistically;\nwhere the rule itself is\r\nwithout logical foundation, it cannot be expected of logic to\r\ncircumscribe its ambit.â\nIt now seems to be generally\r\naccepted that there is no single test to determine which benefits are\r\ncollateral and which are deductible.\nBoth in our country (\nSantam\r\nVersekeringsmaatskappy Bpk v Byleveldt\n(\nsupra\nat 150F) and in England (\nParry\r\nv Cleaver\n[1969] 1\r\nAll ER 555\n(HL)\n(1970) AC 1)\nat 14 and 31 it is acknowledged that\r\npolicy considerations of fairness ultimately play a determinative\r\nrole.â\nIn a dissenting judgment Marais JA said that there can\r\nbe little doubt that the exclusion of benefits flowing from the\r\nbenevolence\nof third parties or from insurance policies which a\r\nplaintiff had himself taken out and paid for is a result intuitively\r\nsensed\nby virtually all to be âfairâ. As to the reason why\r\nbenefits in other classes of cases have not been excluded he\r\nsuspected\nâthat the intuitively sensed âfairnessâ of ignoring\r\nbenefits flowing from the benevolence of third parties or from\r\ninsurance\npolicies which a plaintiff himself had taken out and paid\r\nfor, is either entirely absent in the other classes of case, or not\r\nso\nkeenly sensed.â\n1\n[17]\tIn light of the aforegoing I agree with Neethling,\r\nPotgieter and Visser\nLaw of Delict\n5ed (2006) at p 215-216 that â[q]uestions regarding collateral\r\nbenefits are normative in nature; they have to be approached and\n\nsolved in terms of policy principles and equityâ and that in doing\r\nso âthere should always be a weighing-up of the interests\nof the\r\nplaintiff, the defendant, the source of the benefit as well as the\r\ncommunity in establishing how benefits resulting from\na\r\ndamage-causing event should be treatedâ.\n[18]\tThe defendants submitted that it would be unfair to\r\nallow the plaintiff to receive double compensation and thereby to be\r\nenriched\nin the amount of R695 525, which will occur if the\r\ndefendants are not able to deduct this amount from their overall\r\nliability\nof R850 000. On the other hand there would seem to be\r\nno reason why the defendants should be allowed to benefit from an\r\ninsurance\npolicy which had to be disregarded in respect of the loss\r\nof support claim which they allowed to become prescribed. Should the\r\namount received by the plaintiff from Rand Mutual be disregarded she\r\nmay well consider herself morally obliged to indemnify Rand\nMutual to\r\nthe extent of the benefit payable by Rand Mutual in terms of the CJP\r\nas she would have been obliged to do had her claim\nagainst the Fund\r\nnot become prescribed. I see no reason why she should be deprived of\r\nthat moral choice by withholding the means\nfor her to do so. An order\r\nthat R850 000 be paid to her will therefore also be in the best\r\ninterests of Rand Mutual which\naccording to Mr Mullins who appeared\r\non behalf of the defendants, is âlurking behind (her) claimâ. If\r\nit is, there is nothing\nopprobrious in its conduct. It is out of\r\npocket in the amount of R695 525 and is entitled to try to\r\nrecover this amount.\n[19]\tBut even if the plaintiff does not repay Rand\r\nMutual and thereby profits from the outcome of this litigation, I do\r\nnot think\nit unfair that the defendants compensate her for the full\r\nextent of her loss of R850 000, for this is what she would have\r\nbeen entitled to receive from the Fund had the defendants not\r\nnegligently caused her claim against the Fund to become prescribed.\n\nThe defendants therefore cannot complain â they are no worse off\r\nthan the Fund would have been had they fulfilled their mandate\nto\r\ndiligently pursue her claim against the Fund.\n[20]\tFor these reasons the appeal must fail. The parties\r\nagreed in the stated case that if the plaintiff succeeded in the high\r\ncourt\nshe would be entitled to interest at the rate of 15.5% per\r\nannum calculated from a date 14\ndays after the date of judgment.\n2\nThe high court appears to have inadvertently omitted to reflect this\r\nagreement in its order. The following orders are made:\n(i)\tThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n(ii)\tThe order of the court below is\r\namended to\ninclude the\r\nagreed provision for interest so that it reads:\nâ\nJudgment is entered for the plaintiff against the\r\ndefendants, jointly and severally, the one paying the others to be\r\nabsolved, in\nthe amount of R850 000 (eight hundred and fifty\r\nthousand rand) with interest at the rate of 15.5% per annum\r\ncalculated from\nthe date 14 days after date of judgment with costs\r\nwhich costs are to include the costs attendant upon the employment of\r\nsenior\ncounsel.â\n________________\nA CACHALIA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor Appellant:\tJ F Mullins SC\nInstructed by:\nSavage Jooste & Adams Inc;\r\nPretoria\nWebbers; Bloemfontein\nFor Respondent:\tJ G Bergenthuin SC\nInstructed by:\nVan Zyl Le Roux & Hurter Inc;\r\nPretoria\nMolefi Thoabala Attorneys;\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nAt 48E-G.\n2\nThe reason\r\n\tfor the 14 day delay is inexplicable.

    "facts": "Bruce Francis was killed in a motor‑vehicle collision on 9 October 1998. His widow claimed loss of support from the Road Accident Fund (RAF) and instructed the respondents, who were attorneys, to prosecute the claim. The attorneys failed to issue summons in time, causing the claim to become prescribed. The plaintiff sued the attorneys for professional negligence, seeking R850,000 – the amount she would have recovered from the RAF. In addition, she received a pension of R695,525 from Rand Mutual under a Commuting Journey Policy (CJP) issued to the deceased’s employer. The issue was whether the attorneys could deduct this insurance benefit from their liability.",
    "issues": "The court had to determine (a) whether the attorneys were “third parties” within the meaning of Condition 8 of the CJP and thus liable to indemnify the insurer, and (b) whether section 1(1) of the Assessment of Damages Act 9 of 1969 applied to the plaintiff’s claim against the attorneys, requiring the insurance benefit to be taken into account and deducted from damages.",
    "principles": "The court examined the definition of “third party” in the insurance policy, concluding it applied only to parties whose liability arose from the accident, not from the prescription of a claim. It held that the Assessment of Damages Act applies solely to actions where damages are assessed for loss of support; an action for professional negligence – loss of a claim – falls outside its scope. The judgment also considered the collateral source rule and policy considerations of fairness, emphasizing that benefits should not be deducted where the plaintiff is not contractually obliged to reimburse the insurer.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the court found that the attorneys were not third parties under the CJP and that the Assessment Act did not govern the claim. Consequently, the plaintiff was not required to offset the Rand Mutual pension against the damages owed by the attorneys. The full amount of R850,000, plus interest at 15.5% per annum from 14 days after judgment and costs, was upheld.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The order of the lower court was amended to include the agreed interest provision, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendants jointly and severally for R850,000 with interest at 15.5% per annum from 14 days after judgment and costs."
