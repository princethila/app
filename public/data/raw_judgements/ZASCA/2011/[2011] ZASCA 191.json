Although not a party to the\noriginal application brought in\r\nthe court of first instance, he was granted leave to join those\r\nproceedings as the third respondent.\nThe first and second appellants\r\nare named as parties to the appeal but only the third appellant is\r\npursuing it. The first appellant,\nwhich is an insurance company,\r\nelected to abide by the decision of the court, and the second\r\nappellant decided not to persist with\nthe appeal.\n[2] Ms Sebata was the owner of a life\r\npolicy which the first appellant had issued to her. She had nominated\r\nher mother, Helen Mmapule\nMkhabela, as the beneficiary of the policy\r\nin the event of her death, but reserved the right to change or cancel\r\nthe nomination\n‘at any time’. Ms Mkhabela passed away on\r\n26 May 2007. Her daughter died afterwards, on 12 August 2007,\r\nwhen the\nproceeds of the policy fell due, but without having\r\nnominated another beneficiary. Simon Michael Mkhabela, the respondent\r\nand executor\nof Ms Mkhabela’s deceased estate, then claimed the\r\nproceeds of the policy in the high court.\n[3] The court of first instance\r\n(Coetzee J) dismissed his claim with costs and directed that the\r\nproceeds of the policy be paid\nto the third appellant, as executor of\r\nthe Sebata estate. The learned judge reasoned that when Ms Mkhabela\r\ndied, her daughter’s\nnomination of her as the beneficiary of\r\nthe policy ceased to exist. The policy therefore vested in Ms\r\nSebata’s estate and\nnot her mother’s.\n[4] The full court (Tsoka J, Victor\r\nand Mayat JJ concurring) took a different view. It held that, once Ms\r\nMkhabela accepted her\nnomination as beneficiary, and the first\r\nappellant recorded this, a binding agreement between her and the\r\nfirst appellant came\ninto effect. On Ms Sebata’s death, so the\r\ncourt reasoned, the respondent, as executor of Ms Mkhabela’s\r\nestate, was\nentitled to accept the benefit of the policy. The third\r\nappellant takes issue with the court’s reasoning. The appeal is\r\nbefore\nus with special leave of this court.\n[5] The approach of the full court\r\nproceeded from the premise that the insurance agreement between Ms\r\nSebata and the first appellant\nwas a\nstipulatio alteri\n–\r\nan agreement for the benefit of a third party (Ms Mkahabela). It then\r\nreasoned as follows:\n‘\nThe\r\nagreement creates a\nspes\nfor\r\nMs Mkhabela. Ms Mkhabela has no rights to the policy during the\r\nlifetime of Ms Sebata. The\nspes\nonly\r\nbecomes a right to Ms Mkhabela on the death of Ms Sebata. The\r\nbenefit, on the death of Ms Sebata, is open for acceptance by\nMs\r\nMkhabela. As she had already died at the time the benefit accrued and\r\nher nomination had not been revoked, it remained open\nfor acceptance\r\nby the appellant. That Ms Sebata had, during her lifetime, the right\r\nto cancel or revoke the nomination of a beneficiary,\nis beyond\r\nquestion. Ms Mkahabela accepted the nomination on this basis. The\r\nnomination of Ms Mkhabela as a beneficiary, not having\nbeen revoked\r\nby Ms Sebata before her death, remains a valid agreement between Ms\r\nMkahabela and the [insurance company]. On the\ndeath of Ms Sebata the\r\nproceeds of the insurance company accrue to the estate of Ms\r\nMkhabela. Contrary to the view taken by the\nCourt below, the\r\nagreement between Ms Mkhabela and the [insurance company] did not . .\r\n. become extinct . . ..’\n[6] The full court was correct in its\r\nview that Ms Sebata’s nomination of her mother as the\r\nbeneficiary under the policy was\na contract for the benefit of her\r\nmother as a third party, which was capable of acceptance upon the\r\ndeath of the policy holder.\n1\nBut it then, with respect, erroneously\r\nfound that Ms Mkhabela’s acceptance of her\nnomination\nas a beneficiary had some legal\r\nsignificance.\n[7] It is well established that a\r\nnominated beneficiary does not acquire any right to the proceeds of a\r\npolicy during the lifetime\nof the policy owner. It is only on the\r\npolicy owner’s death that the nominated beneficiary is entitled\r\nto accept the benefit\nand the insurer is obligated to pay the\r\nproceeds of the policy to the beneficiary.\n2\nUntil the death of the policy owner,\r\nthe nominated beneficiary only has a\nspes\n(an expectation) of claiming the\r\nbenefit of the policy – the nominated beneficiary has no vested\r\nright to the benefit.\n3\n[8] It follows that if the nominated\r\nbeneficiary predeceases the policy owner, she would have had no right\r\nto any benefit of the\npolicy at the time of her death. Put simply,\r\nwhen the nominated beneficiary dies, the\nspes\nevaporates. It falls away.\r\nThe fact that a nominated beneficiary accepts the nomination cannot\r\nchange this.\n[9] Likewise, where, as here, the\r\ninsured expressly reserves the right to change or cancel the\r\nnomination, the nominated beneficiary\nhas no claim to the benefit of\r\nthe policy until the insured’s death. For if the insured\r\nsubsequently chooses another beneficiary\nthereby revoking the first,\r\nthe first nominee’s acceptance becomes nugatory.\n4\nAnd, where the insured does not revoke\r\nthe nomination of the nominated beneficiary, as in this case, the\r\nbeneficiary is in exactly\nthe same position as if there were no\r\nrevocation clause. In other words, until the death of the insured the\r\nnominated beneficiary\nhas no right to claim any benefit of the\r\npolicy. This means that because Ms Mkhabela died before her daughter,\r\nher\nspes\nlogically expired at the same time.\r\nThere was thus no enforceable right that was transmissible to the\r\nMkhabela estate. The benefit\nremained with the insured, Ms Sebata,\r\nuntil her death approximately two months later, when it fell into her\r\nestate.\n[10] That the approach adopted by the\r\nfull court does not withstand scrutiny was demonstrated by Mr\r\nMundell, who appeared for the\nappellant. He asked what would have\r\nhappened to the\nspes\nif the nominated beneficiary had died two\r\nyears, instead of two months, before the policy owner, and her estate\r\nwas finally wound\nup before the policy owner’s death. And the\nspes\n, not being an enforceable right, is not reflected in the\r\nLiquidation and Distribution account. The consequence of the full\r\ncourt’s\nreasoning is that the\nspes\nwould have somehow\r\nrevived and become enforceable on the death of the policy owner,\r\nwhich is simply not possible.\n[11] In the result the appeal must\r\nsucceed, with costs, and the order of the full court should be\r\naltered to read:\n‘\nThe appeal is dismissed with\r\ncosts.’\n_________________\nA CACHALIA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nFor 2\nnd\nand 3\nrd\nAppellant: A R G Mundell SC\nInstructed\r\nby:\nWerksmans\r\nInc, Sandton\nSymington\r\n& De Kok, Bloemfontein\nFor\r\nRespondent: E M Matanda\nInstructed\r\nby:\nMankoe Inc c/o Tsebane Molaba Inc,\r\nJohannesburg\nMphafi\r\nKhang Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nMoonsamy\r\n\tv Nedcor Bank Ltd\n2004 (3) SA 513\n(D) at 518B.\n2\nIbid\r\n\t518A-B.\n3\nIt\r\n\tshould be noted that although the parties referred to\nMutual Life\r\n\tInsurance Co of New York v Hotz\n1911 AD 556\n, the case does not\r\n\tassist the decision here since the facts were completely different.\r\n\tThere, the policy owner claimed the surrender\nvalue on his father’s\r\n\tdeath.
