In brief, s 228 provides that the\r\ndirectors of a company may not dispose of the whole or the greater\r\npart of\nits assets without the approval of the shareholders. The\r\nquestions raised have been debated over decades and there are\r\nconflicting\nanswers given by the courts. But the debates and\r\nauthorities precede an amendment (in 2006) to the section that\r\nrequires that the\nshareholders’ consent or ratification must\r\ntake the form of a special resolution. Before dealing with the\r\nprinciples I shall\nset out the background briefly. For the purpose of\r\nthis appeal the facts are largely not in dispute.\n[2] On 30 January 2009 the second appellant, Mr N van\r\nZyl, acting for a company to be formed, Stand 242 Hendrick Potgieter\r\nRoad\nRuimsig (Pty) Ltd (Stand 242), the first appellant, purchased\r\nimmovable property from the seventh respondent, Bubesi Investments\n\n196 (Pty) Ltd (Bubesi). The property was Bubesi’s sole asset.\r\nBubesi was represented by two directors, Mr Karl-Heinz Göbel\nand\r\nMr V Wilken . The purchase price was some R31 million. The terms of\r\nthe contract are not germane to the appeal.\n[3] The shares in Bubesi are owned in equal shares by\r\ntwo trusts: the Karl-Heinz Göbel Trust and the Deutra Trust. The\r\nfirst\nthree respondents are the trustees of the Göbel Trust and\r\nthe fourth, fifth and sixth respondents are the trustees of the\r\nDeutra Trust. Göbel, the second respondent, is married to the\r\nfirst respondent, Mrs C Göbel. And Wilken is married to\nthe\r\nfifth respondent, Mrs A Wilken.\n[4] On 2 February 2009 Göbel and Wilken signed a\r\ndocument certifying that they were the directors of Bubesi, and that\r\nthe sale\nhad been approved by the shareholders ‘in a general\r\nmeeting in terms of section 228 of the Companies Act’ or that\r\nthe\nproperty ‘does not constitute the whole or greater part of\r\nthe assets of the company’. Both statements (in the\r\nalternative)\nwere false. As I have said, the property was the sole\r\nasset of the company, and the other trustees of the shareholding\r\ntrusts asserted\nthat they were not aware of the sale.\n[5] At the time of the sale Bubesi, the seller, was in\r\nfinancial difficulty, and the proceeds of the sale were intended to\r\nrepay\nthe bondholder over the property. Shortly after the sale\r\nvarious disputes arose between Bubesi and Stand 242. And, despite the\r\nconclusion of the agreement of sale, Bubesi let the property to a\r\nthird party for a period of three years, and an alternative source\nof\r\nfinance, related to the new lessee, was found.\n[6] It thus became apparent to Van Zyl, representing\r\nStand 242, that Bubesi was not going to perform in terms of their\r\nagreement.\nThey accordingly brought an urgent application in the\r\nSouth Gauteng High Court against Bubesi for an order interdicting it\r\nfrom\ndealing with the property pending an action to be instituted\r\nagainst it. The trustees of the shareholding trusts were not cited\nas\r\nparties. Bubesi opposed the application, relying inter alia on the\r\nfact that s 228 had not been complied with. Jajbhay J, without\ngiving\r\nreasons, granted the order sought on 30 July 2009.\n[7] Apart from Göbel and Wilken, the trustees of\r\nthe shareholding trusts claimed not to have been aware of the sale,\r\nor the\norder sought, until after it was granted. The trustees and\r\nBubesi thus brought an urgent application (in the same court and\r\nunder\nthe same case number) seeking a declaratory order setting aside\r\nthat of Jajhbay J, and an order that there had been non-compliance\n\nwith s 228 and that the sale was thus unenforceable. Lamont J granted\r\nthe orders sought, but gave leave to appeal to this court.\n[8] There was indeed no special resolution, either\r\nauthorizing or ratifying the sale to Stand 242, passed by the\r\nshareholders of\nBubesie. Nor was there any evidence that the trustees\r\nof the shareholding trusts of Bubesi were aware of or had consented\r\nto the\nsale. Stand 242 argued that the trustees were Wilken and Göbel\r\nand their respective wives, who must have known of the sale\nand thus\r\nconsented to it.\n[9] It should be noted, however, that Stand 242 has\r\ninstituted an action for specific performance or damages against\r\nWilken and\nGöbel for R10.2 million. The question of knowledge\r\nand consent will no doubt be tested in that action. The questions\r\nbefore\nus are thus limited: does the Turquand rule allow the\r\ncircumvention of s 228 of the Act, or does estoppel preclude reliance\r\non\ns 228?\n[10] Section 228, as amended in\r\n2006,\n1\nprovides in so far as relevant:\n‘\nDisposal of undertaking or greater part of\r\nassets of company\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in its\r\nmemorandum or articles, the directors of a company shall not have the\r\npower,\nsave by a special resolution of\r\nits members\n, to dispose of-\n(a)\nthe\r\nwhole or the greater part of the undertaking of the company; or\n(b)\nthe whole or the greater part of the assets of the company.\n. . . .\n(3) A special resolution of a company shall\r\nnot be effective in approving a disposal described in subsection (1)\r\nor\n(2) unless it authorizes or ratifies in terms the specific\r\ntransaction.’ (My emphasis.)\n[11] As I have said, the authorities and writers that\r\nhave considered the question whether the Turquand rule, or estoppel,\r\nobviates\nthe need for compliance with s 228 predate the amendment\r\nwhich now requires a special resolution of shareholders for the\r\ndisposition\nof the sole asset of a company. Whether the amendment\r\nmakes any difference to the question of principle is a matter to\r\nwhich I\nshall turn.\nSection 228 and the Turquand rule\n[12] The rule, in essence, is that a\r\nperson dealing with a company in good faith is entitled to assume\r\nthat the company has complied\nwith its internal procedures and\r\nformalities. It emanates from\nRoyal\r\nBritish Bank v Turquand\n2\nand has been accepted as part of\r\nSouth African law at least since\nThe\r\nMine Workers’ Union v J P Prinsloo; The Mine Workers’\r\nUnion v Greyling\n.\n3\nThe purpose of the rule is based on\r\ncommercial convenience: business might well be impeded if parties\r\ndealing with agents of a company\nhad to investigate in all instances\r\nwhether internal rules had been duly observed.\n[13] Section 228 (and s 70\ndec\n(2)\r\nof the Companies Act 46 of 1926, which was in the same terms) was\r\nintroduced for the protection of shareholders who have given\ngeneral\r\ncontrol of the company to its directors. It is the shareholders\r\nthemselves who should exercise control over the disposal\nof the\r\ncompany’s major assets. The authorities to this effect are\r\ndiscussed by Cleaver J in\nFarren\r\nv Sun Service SA Photo Trip Management (Pty) Ltd\n.\n4\nIn\nFarren\nthe court held that the Turquand rule\r\ndid not operate to override the provisions of s 228. While a contract\r\nentered into without\nthe shareholders’ consent was not void,\r\nCleaver J held,\n5\nit could not be enforced until the\r\nshareholders had consented or ratified the contract for the disposal\r\nof the major part of the\ncompany’s assets. The reason for this\r\nis the purpose of s 228: to protect shareholders.\n[14]\nFarren\nis the only decision that has held\r\nthat the Turquand rule is inapplicable in so far as compliance with s\r\n228 is concerned. There\nis, however, an obiter dictum of Van Zyl J in\nLevy & others v\r\nZalrut Investments (Pty) Ltd\n6\nwhich indicates that there is no\r\nreason why the Turquand rule should not apply to s 228 (that case\r\ndealt with whether there was\ncompliance with s 228 on the basis that\r\nthere was unanimous consent of the shareholders). Van Zyl J said that\r\nthere was no indication\n‘that the public interest or public\r\npolicy played any part in the intention of the Legislature when it\r\nenacted . . . s 228’.\nAccordingly there was no reason why a\r\nparty to a contract, in good faith, need be adversely affected should\r\nthe company’s\ninternal procedures not be followed.\n[15] In commentary on this view\r\nvarious writers have argued that since no public interest is\r\ninvolved, the equities lie in favour\nof the innocent third party\r\nwhere the shareholders have given control to the directors. Should\r\nthe directors act without the shareholders’\nconsent, an action\r\nlies against them for breach of their duties. Other commentary has\r\nsuggested that the purpose of s 228 is to\nprotect the rights of\r\nshareholders and that the application of the Turquand rule would\r\ndefeat those rights. The respective views\nare discussed\r\ncomprehensively in\nFarren\nand I do not propose to repeat them\r\nhere.\n7\n[16] In my view, the clear meaning of s 228 is that the\r\nshareholders must give their consent to, or ratify, the disposal of\r\nthe\nsole asset, or the major assets, of a company. If the purpose of\r\ns 228 is the protection of the shareholders, then the application\nof\r\nthe Turquand rule would deprive them of that protection. The section\r\nwould then serve no purpose. It would be cold comfort to\na\r\nshareholder, when the company loses its substratum, to be told to sue\r\nthe directors who have acted without approval.\n[17] In\nFarren\nCleaver J\r\nconsidered that the meaning of the words in s 228 were unambiguous:\r\nthey could not be read so as to allow the Turquand\nrule to prevail\r\nover the rights of shareholders.\n8\nThis is the view adopted by the court\r\nbelow: without the consent of the shareholders the directors had no\r\nauthority to sell the\nproperty, the sole asset of the company, and\r\nthe sale was unenforceable. Lamont J held that until the statutory\r\nrequirement (enacted\nonly after\nFarren\nwas decided) of a\r\nspecial resolution was met, the contract for the sale of the Bubesi\r\nproperty was unenforceable.\n[18] That brings me to the amendment\r\nto s 228 which now requires that the consent or ratification must be\r\ngiven by a special resolution\nwhich, to be effective, must be\r\nregistered within one month of the passing of the resolution.\n9\nAs Henochsberg states:\n10\n‘\nUnfortunately, the amendments to s 228 do\r\nnot address the controversy as to whether a third party to whom an\r\ninvalid disposal is\nmade is entitled to enforce it against the\r\ncompany by means of the application of the rule in the\nTurquand\ncase since the invalidity or\r\n“non-effectiveness” of the special resolution does not\r\nentail that the related contract\nbetween the company and the third\r\nparty is, as between them, void or unenforceable . . . .’\n[19] Bubesi argued that the introduction of the\r\nrequirement that consent or ratification take the form of a special\r\nresolution underscored\nthe purpose of s 228 – the protection of\r\nshareholders. This seems to have been the view also of the court\r\nbelow, for Lamont\nJ said that the requirement of a special\r\nresolution, that must be registered to be effective, indicated that\r\nthe consent to the\ndisposition of the property is more than an\r\ninternal management act that the Turquand rule is designed to cover.\r\nThird parties,\nsaid the court, are not entitled to assume that\r\nshareholders participate in management.\n[20] Stand 242, on the other hand,\r\npointed out that the reason for the amendment to s 228 was to protect\r\nminority shareholders.\nJ L Yeats, in a note on the amendments\r\neffected to the Act in 2006,\n11\nrefers to the explanatory memorandum\r\nto the amendment bill, and points out that the requirement of a\r\nspecial resolution to embody\nthe consent to the disposal of a\r\ncompany’s main asset or assets, is designed to protect minority\r\nshareholders, especially\nwhere a company is the target of a takeover\r\nbid.\n[21] Yeats is of the view that the\r\namendment makes no difference to the application of the Turquand rule\r\nto s 228. If a special\nresolution has been passed and registered,\r\nthen of course the third party would have access to it, or possibly\r\nbe deemed to have\nconstructive notice.\n12\nBut if the special resolution is not\r\nyet registered when enquiries are made, or the resolution ratifies\r\nthe decision of the shareholders\nafter enquiries are made, then the\r\nthird party will be in no better position. (Of course if a resolution\r\nis not registered within\nsix months of its passing, then it lapses: s\r\n202 of the Act.) I accept that the requirement of a special\r\nresolution in this context\nthus does not assist the third party.\n[22] Accordingly, in my view the\r\nrequirement of a special resolution does not change the principle as\r\nto the application of the\nTurquand rule to s 228. As I have said\r\nearlier, the Turquand rule should not apply to s 228, for if it did,\r\nthe section would not\nserve the purpose of protecting shareholders as\r\nit is intended to do. I consider that Lamont J in the high court,\r\nwhen following\nCleaver J in\nFarren\n,\r\nwas correct.\nEstoppel\n[23] Stand 242 argued also that it\r\nhad been misled into believing that Wilken and Göbel had the\r\nnecessary authority to conclude\nthe sale, and had relied on the\r\ndocument signed by them that stated that the disposal of the property\r\n‘has been approved\nby the Shareholders in a General Meeting in\r\nterms of s 228 of the Companies Act: or the . . . property does not\r\nconstitute the\nwhole or the greater part of the assets of the\r\ncompany’. Counsel for the appellants did not persist in the\r\nargument based\non estoppel, accepting that it was not the\r\nshareholders themselves who had made the representation. Moreover,\r\nthe document was\nprepared by the conveyancer for Stand 242, not the\r\nsellers’ representative. In any event, the full facts are not\r\nbefore us.\nAnd most importantly, estoppel cannot operate to allow a\r\ncontravention of a statute:\nCity\r\nof Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality v RPM Bricks (Pty) Ltd\n.\n13\n[24] In the circumstances, I find that the Turquand rule\r\ndoes not override the requirements of s 228 of the Act, and that\r\nestoppel\ndid not operate to preclude the respondents from relying on\r\nit. Accordingly, the order of Lamont J in the high court must stand.\n[25] The appeal is dismissed with costs.\n______________\nC H Lewis\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nAPPELLANTS: R Stockwell S C\nInstructed by\nWhalley & van der Lith Inc,\nJohannesburg;\nBezuidenhout Inc,\nBloemfontein.\nRESPONDENTS: J P Blignaut\nInstructed by\nLynette Steyn,\nRoodepoort;\nNaude’s Attorneys,\nBloemfontein.\n1\nAmended\r\n\tby\ns 21\nof the\nCorporate Laws Amendment Act 24 of 2006\n, which came\r\n\tinto effect in 2007.\n2\nRoyal\r\n\tBritish Bank v Turquand\n[1855] EngR 531\n;\n(1856) 119 ER 474\n(5 E & B 248),\r\n\tconfirmed on appeal:\n[1856] EngR 470\n;\n(1856) 119 ER 886\n(Ex Ch) (6 E & B 327).\n3\nThe\r\n\tMine Workers’ Union v J P Prinsloo; The Mine Workers’\r\n\tUnion v Greyling\n1948 (3) SA 831\n(A).\n4\nFarren\r\n\tv Sun Service SA Photo Trip Management (Pty) Ltd\n2004\r\n\t(2) SA 146\n(C) para 10.\n5\nParagraph\r\n\t11.\n6\nLevy\r\n\t& others v Zalrut Investments (Pty) Ltd\n1986 (4) SA 479\n(W)\r\n\tat 487B-F.\n7\nSee\r\n\talso\nHenochsberg on the Companies Act\n(ed J A Kunst, Professor P Delport and\r\n\tProfessor Q Vorster) Vol 1 at 441ff.\n8\nParagraph\r\n\t17.\n9\nSection\r\n\t199 of the Act deals with the requirements for the passing of a\r\n\tspecial resolution and s 200 with the registration.\n10\nAbove\r\n\tat 443.\n11\nJ\r\n\tL Yeats ‘The Drafters’ Dilemma: Some comments on the\r\n\tCorporate Laws Amendment Bill, 2006’\n(2006) 123\nSALJ\n601\nat 610ff\n.\n12\nYeats\r\n\tabove at 613.\n13\nCity\r\n\tof Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality v RPM Bricks (Pty) Ltd\n2008\r\n\t(3) SA 1\n(SCA) paras 11-13 and 16.",

    "facts": "In January 2009 Stand 242 Hendrik Potgieter Road Ruimsig (Pty) Ltd, represented by N van Zyl, purchased an immovable property from Bubesi Investments 196 (Pty) Ltd for roughly R31 million. The property was the sole asset of Bubesi, which was owned equally by two trusts. The directors of Bubesi, Karl‑Heinz Göbel and Vernon Wilken, signed a document stating that the sale had been approved by shareholders in a general meeting under s 228 of the Companies Act, or that the property did not constitute the whole or greater part of the company's assets—both statements were false. After the sale Bubesi leased the property to a third party and later sought an interdict to prevent further dealing with the property. The trustees of the shareholding trusts, unaware of the sale, applied to set aside the interdict, arguing non‑compliance with s 228. The High Court granted their application; the appellant appealed.",
    "issues": "The appellate court had to determine (1) whether the Turquand rule could be used to bypass the statutory requirement of a special resolution under s 228 for the disposal of a company's sole or major asset, and (2) whether estoppel could prevent the respondents from relying on the statutory breach.",
    "principles": "Section 228 (as amended in 2006) requires a special resolution of shareholders, registered within one month, to authorise the disposal of the whole or greater part of a company's assets. The Turquand rule allows third parties dealing in good faith to assume internal compliance, but case law (e.g., Farren v Sun Service) holds that the rule does not override s 228 because the purpose of the provision is to protect shareholders. Estoppel cannot be invoked to permit a statutory violation (City of Tshwane v RPM Bricks).",
    "application": "The court examined the factual matrix and noted that no special resolution was passed or registered authorising the sale, and the directors acted without shareholder consent. Applying the principle that the Turquand rule does not apply to s 228, the court concluded that the sale was unauthorised and therefore unenforceable. Likewise, estoppel was rejected as it cannot circumvent a statutory prohibition.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The High Court’s order setting aside the interdict and declaring the sale non‑compliant with s 228 was affirmed."
