The court of first instance (Meer J) dismissed the\r\napplication with costs. With leave of the court of first instance,\r\nKernsig\nappealed to the full bench of the Western Cape High Court\r\n(the court a quo).\n[2] The court a quo (Fourie J; Traverso AJP and Yekiso J\r\nconcurring) reversed the decision of the court of first instance and\r\ngranted\nthe order sought by Kernsig. The matter is before this court\r\nafter this court granted Absa special leave to appeal.\n[3] Messrs P J Greyling and J A Greyling are the sole\r\ndirectors and shareholders of Kernsig. Kernsig owns an immovable\r\nproperty\nknown as Karoovlakte farm situated in the district of\r\nKlawer, Western Cape. P J Greyling and J A Greyling formed a\r\npartnership\nknown as Karoovlakte Boerdery (the partnership) and the\r\npartnership conducted farming activities on Karoovlakte farm which\r\nthey\nleased from Kernsig.\n[4] Absa, through its Vredendal branch, was the banker\r\nof the partnership. Absa granted the partnership an overdraft\r\nfacility on\nthe partnership's cheque account and short-term loans. As\r\nsecurity for the facilities granted to the partnership, six covering\r\nmortgage bonds were registered against the title deed of Karoovlakte\r\nfarm in favour of Absa. The total amount secured by the mortgage\n\nbonds was R1.11 million. As I have said, the bonds were covering\r\nbonds and each provided:\n'Voortdurende Dekkingsverband\nHierdie verband sal van krag bly\r\nas 'n voortdurende dekkende sekuriteit vir die hoofsom – die\r\nrente daarop en die bykomende\nbedrag, ondanks enige tussentydse\r\nskuldvereffening en, ondanks enige tussentydse skuldvereffening, sal\r\nhierdie verband van volle\nkrag en effek bly as 'n voortdurende\r\nsekureits- en dekkingsverband vir enige en elke bedrag wat die\r\nVerbandgewer nou of hierna\naan die Bank verskuldig mag wees\r\nvoortspruitend uit welke oorsaak ookal tot die bedrag van die\r\nhoofsom, die rente daarop en die\nbykomende bedrag.'\n[5] Mr Johan Brand (Brand), the relationship manager of\r\nthe Vredendal branch, was not happy about the manner in which the\r\nGreylings\nwere conducting the two accounts. The limit of the\r\noverdraft facility was frequently exceeded and the loan repayments\r\nwere not\nmade timeously.\n[6] Attorney Visser (Visser), Kernsig's attorney of\r\nrecord, and a sister of P J Greyling, was known to Brand as her law\r\npractice\noperated an account at the Vredendal branch of Absa. Visser\r\nand P J Greyling discussed the possible sale of Karoovlakte farm with\n\nBrand over several months.\n[7] On 6 September 2005 the Greylings entered into a\r\nwritten sale agreement of Karoovlakte farm with Mr Lionel Patrick\r\nBarnard and\nhis wife Christine Barnard (the Barnards). The\r\ntransaction was structured in such a manner that the Barnards would\r\nbuy the Greylings'\nentire shareholding in Kernsig and as part payment\r\nof the purchase price, take over the partnership's financial\r\nobligations towards\nAbsa.\n[8] Brand, as a result of his discussions with Visser\r\nand the Greylings, was aware of the fact that it was a term of the\r\nsale agreement\nthat the Barnards would, in the name of Kernsig, take\r\nover the financial obligations of the partnership towards Absa. That\r\nentailed\nthat the debts of the partnership would be consolidated and\r\nbe paid by Kernsig with the proceeds of a loan that Kernsig would\r\nobtain\nfrom Absa. The Barnards, in their own names, would not have\r\nqualified for a loan.\n[9] The 6 September 2005 agreement of the sale of\r\nKernsig was replaced by an almost identical sales agreement dated 30\r\nNovember\n2005. Clause 3 thereof reads as follows:\n'3. Koopprys\nDie koopsom is die bedrag van R2\r\n000 000.00 (twee miljoen rand) betaalbaar deur die koper aan die\r\nverkoper as volg:\n'n Bedrag van R150 000.00 (een\r\n\t\thonderd en vyftig duisend rand) reeds betaal;\nDie oorname van alle skulde\r\n\t\tvan die maatskappy insluitend die Landbou kredietlening ten bedrae\r\n\t\tvan R57 750.00, asook die verbande\nwat oor die eiendom van die\r\n\t\tmaatskappy geregistreer is in naam van Karoovlakte Boerdery. In\r\n\t\ttotaliteit die bedrag van R1 137\n750.00.\nDie balans van die koopsom\r\n\t\tnaamlik R712 250.00 word in 12 jaarlikse paaiemente afbetaal\r\n\t\twaarvan die eerste betaling op 1 Augustus\n2006 sal geskied en\r\n\t\tdaarna jaarliks voor of op die einde van Julie . . .'.\n[10] The shares of Kernsig were not transferred into the\r\nname of the Barnards and in order for Kernsig to apply for a loan,\r\nBrand\nrequired the Greylings to give authority to Barnard to apply\r\nfor the loan in the name of Kernsig. Barnard applied on behalf of\r\nKernsig for a loan of R1.1 million and same was approved or granted\r\non 8 December 2005. The covering mortgage bonds already registered\n\nagainst the title deed of Karoovlakte farm referred to earlier,\r\nserved as security for the loan granted to Kernsig.\n[11] On the day that the loan was approved, Visser\r\ntelephoned Brand enquiring about the progress of Kernsig's loan\r\napplication.\nThe proceeds of the loan were paid to Kernsig and they\r\nwere utilised to pay off the loan and overdraft facility of the\r\npartnership\non 25 January 2006, and Kernsig remained with a debt of\r\nR1.1 million.\n[12] The Barnards, who had taken possession and\r\noccupation of the farm during September 2005, vacated the farm in\r\nFebruary 2008\nand returned the keys of the farm to the Greylings. The\r\nGreylings accepted the Barnards' repudiation of the sale agreement,\r\nand\ncancelled it.\n[13] In May 2008, after Kernsig sold Karoovlakte farm to\r\nanother buyer, Visser wrote a letter to Absa wherein she demanded\r\nthat\nAbsa cancel the mortgage bonds registered against the title deed\r\nof Karoovlakte as, according to her, the partnership's debts for\n\nwhich the mortgage bonds served as security, had been liquidated.\r\nAbsa refused to do so, alleging that the mortgage bonds served\nas\r\nsecurity for the loan granted to Kernsig. Absa required payment of\r\nR1.25 million before it would cancel the mortgage bonds.\n[14] In the founding affidavit, the deponent (P J\r\nGreyling) stated that he together with his co-director and\r\nco-shareholder were\nnot aware of any further loan given to Kernsig\r\nand referred to a letter written to Absa requesting details of the\r\nauthority of\nthe applicant for any such loan. Their case was that the\r\ndebt of the partnership had been extinguished and consequently the\r\nmortgage\nbonds should be cancelled. In the answering affidavit Absa\r\nalleged that the loan agreement had been entered into by Absa and\r\nKernsig\nwith the full knowledge and authorisation of the directors\r\nand shareholders of Kernsig, and that consequently, the mortgage\r\nbonds\nserved as security for the new loan granted to Kernsig. This\r\nwas disputed in the replying affidavit. Before the court of first\r\ninstance Kernsig elected, despite the dispute of fact, to have the\r\nmatter adjudicated upon on the papers without a referral for\noral\r\nevidence.\n[15] The court of first instance found that the loan\r\nagreement had been concluded between Absa and Kernsig and dismissed\r\nthe application.\nIt is unlikely that the court of first instance was\r\ninvited to determine whether the loan agreement contravened the\r\nprovisions\nof s 38 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 as the judgment\r\nmakes no mention of such an argument. It was only mentioned as part\r\nof\nthe court's recordal of allegations made on behalf of the\r\nrespondent which are set out below.\n[16] The case that the loan agreement contravened s 38\r\nwas not raised in the founding affidavit in any shape or form. In the\r\nreplying\naffidavit the section was referred to in three passages.\n(a) In the first, the deponent said:\n'Ek ontken dat Applikant op 22\r\nSeptember 2005 deur bemiddeling van die Vredendal tak van Respondent,\r\naansoek gedoen het vir 'n termynlening\nen dra geen kennis van\r\nsodanige aansoek nie.\n. . .\nApplikant voer respekvol aan en\r\ngrond sy aansoek hierop, naamlik dat\nL P & C Barnard op geen\r\n\tstadium direkteure van Applikant was nie.\nHul op geen stadium deur die\r\n\tbestaande direkteure van Applikant van 'n volmag, hetsy skriftelik\r\n\tof mondeling of by implikasie,\nvoorsien is om in die naam van\r\n\tApplikant op te tree nie.\nDaar op geen stadium 'n\r\n\tresolusie deur die direkteure van Applikant geneem is om 'n\r\n\ttermynlening van R1.1 miljoen met Respondent\naan te gaan nie of wat\r\n\tBarnard magtig om in naam van Applikant so 'n termynlening aan te\r\n\tgaan nie.\nDaar op geen stadium\r\n\ttoestemming deur die direkteure van Applikant verleen is dat die\r\n\tbates van Applikant as sekuriteit vir 'n\ntermynlening van R1.1\r\n\tmiloen gebruik kon word nie.\nDie aandele nooit op enige\r\n\tstadium aan Barnard oorgedra is nie.\nDie doel van die koopooreenkoms\r\n\twas dat Barnard uit persoonlike finansies die koopsom aan Applikant\r\n\tmoes vereffen en as deel daarvan,\ndie skulde van Applikant en/of\r\n\tKaroovlakte Boerdery moes oorneem. Daarna moes sekuriteitsverbande\r\n\tgeregistreer word oor Wildernis\nEiendomme waarna die aandele van\r\n\tApplikant aan Barnard oorgedra word.\nApplikant is nie regtens\r\n\ttoelgelaat om eie bates te beswaar ten einde behulpsaam te wees om\r\n\tdie verkoop van aandele te finansier\nnie.'\n(b) In the second, the deponent said:\n'Applikant ontken ten sterkste\r\ndat dit 'n term van die transaksie was dat Barnard in die naam van\r\nApplikant bestaande verpligtinge\nvan Karoovlakte Boerdery teenoor\r\nRespondent moes oorneem deurdat die oortrokke tjekrekening en die\r\ntermynlening-skuld gekonsolideer\nword en deur die Applikant betaal\r\nsou word deur middel van 'n nuwe fassiliteit wat aan die Applikant\r\ntoestaan sou word.\nApplikant verwys met respek na\r\ndie aanhef van die vermelde koopkontrak (aanhangsel PJG 2 tot\r\nKennisgewing van Mosie) waaruit dit\nduidelik blyk dat die ooreenkoms\r\ntussen Applikant en L P & C Barnard was en dat lg die aandele van\r\nApplikant gekoop het.\nVerder wys Applikant die\r\nRespondent ook respekvol na die bepalings van Art 38 van die Wet op\r\nMaatskappye wat impliseer dat Barnard\nnie Applikant se bates kon\r\nbeswaar ter verkryging/bekomming van die aandele nie. Dit was dus\r\ndeurentyd die bedoeling tussen die\npartye dat Barnard in sy\r\npersoonlike hoedanigheid finansiering sou bekom ten einde die koopsom\r\nte delg. Soos die Respondent tereg\nopmerk, is beide Visser en ekself\r\nregsgeleerdes. Nie een van voormelde twee persone sou ooit toestem\r\ndat die koper die bates van\ndie Applikant kon beswaar ten einde die\r\naandele van Applikant te bekom nie. In elk geval is die aandele nooit\r\naan Barnard oorgedra\nnie.'\n(c) In the third, the deponent said:\n'Hierdie beweringe van\r\nRespondent word onomwonde ontken. Daar was nooit enige sprake dat 'n\r\ntermynlening aan die Applikant toegestaan\nmoes word ten einde\r\nKaroovlakte Boerdery se skuld af te los nie. Dit sou sinneloos wees\r\naangesien dieselfde vennote in Karoovlakte\nBoerdery ook die\r\ndirekteure en aandeelhouers Applikant was en sou dit slegs 'n\r\nverskuiwing van skuldverpligtinge wees. Verder sou\nso 'n transaksie\r\nook nie regtens toelaatbaar wees nie. Die direkteure van Applikant is\r\nook nooit sedert September 2005 gekontak\nrakende betalings en/of die\r\ngebrek aan betalings van die premies van 'n termynlening nie.’\n[17] In the first passage, the section is not mentioned\r\nspecifically and the allegation at the end would not have served to\r\nalert\nAbsa that its provisions were being relied upon as an\r\nindependent cause of action for the cancellation of the bonds. In the\r\nsecond\npassage, the section was not relied upon for an argument that\r\nthe loan of 8 December 2005 was void and that the bonds should be\n\ncancelled for that reason. Rather, the section was relied upon to\r\nsupport Kernsig's version that the Barnards were not authorised\nto\r\nact on behalf of Kernsig to apply for the loan or to agree that the\r\nexisting bonds would remain to secure it. The same applies\nto the\r\nthird passage. The alleged invalidity of the loan is there put\r\nforward to support an argument that the Barnards were not\nauthorised\r\nto represent Kernsig in obtaining the loan, not an argument that if\r\nsuch a loan had been granted, Kernsig would contend\nthat it was\r\ninvalid because of the provisions of s 38.\n[18] The allegation that the loan agreement contravened\r\ns 38 was apparently raised squarely for the first time in the\r\napplication\nfor leave to appeal which served before the court of\r\nfirst instance. When granting leave to appeal, the court of first\r\ninstance\nstated, inter alia:\n'I am of the view that another\r\nCourt could well come to a different decision as to whether\r\nRespondent disclosed a defence, and as\nto whether the loan was\r\nimproper in the light of section 38 of the Companies Act 1993. This\r\nbeing so, I must find there to be a\nreasonable prospect of success on\r\nappeal.'\n[19] The court a quo found that the loan agreement\r\ncontravened s 38(1) of the Companies Act. The court reasoned that it\r\ncannot be\nsaid that the direct object of the loan agreement of 8\r\nDecember 2005 was to enable Kernsig as mortgagor to take over the\r\npartnership's\ndebt.\n[20] The sole question raised by Kernsig in the appeal\r\nbefore this court was whether the loan agreement contravened s 38.\r\nThat section\nreads as follows:\n'No financial assistance to\r\npurchase shares of company or holding company ─\n(1) No company shall give,\r\nwhether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan,\r\nguarantee, the provision of security\nor otherwise, any financial\r\nassistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or\r\nsubscription made or to be made by\nany person of or for any shares of\r\nthe company, or where the company is a subsidiary company, of its\r\nholding company.'\n[21] The main purpose of s 38 is to protect the\r\ncreditors and minority shareholders of a company. A person who\r\npurchases shares\nin a company must do so out of his or her own funds,\r\nbecause using the company's resources to buy shares of that\r\nparticular company\nmay prejudice the creditors and minority\r\nshareholders of that company. As Nicholas AJA said in\nLewis\r\nv Oneanate (Pty) Ltd & Another\n[1992] ZASCA 174\n;\n1992 (4)\r\nSA 811\n(A) at 818A-B:\n'The object of a provision such\r\nas s 38(1) is the protection of creditors of a company, who have a\r\nright to look to its paid-up\ncapital as the fund out of which their\r\ndebts are to be discharged . . . The purpose of the Legislature was\r\nto avoid that fund being\nemployed or depleted or exposed to possible\r\nrisk in consequence of transactions concluded for the purpose of or\r\nin connection with\nthe purchase of its shares.'\nSee\r\nalso\nGardner & Another v Margo\n2006 (6) SA 33\n(SCA) at para 45.\n[22] The section is drawn in very wide terms. It\r\nprohibits a company from giving financial assistance to any person\r\nfor the purpose\nof or in connection with the purchase of its shares,\r\nor in the case of a subsidiary company for the purchase of shares of\r\nits holding\ncompany. There has therefore been a tendency to give the\r\nsection a narrow interpretation. In\nGardner &\r\nAnother v Margo\nsupra at para 47 Van Heerden\r\nJA said:\n'In\nLipschitz NO v UDC Bank Ltd\nthis Court appears to have accepted the\r\ndistinction drawn by Schreiner JA in\nGradwell\r\n(Pty) Ltd v Rostra Printers Ltd\nbetween the\r\n\"ultimate goal\" of the\ntransaction in question and its \"direct object\",\r\nand to accept that it is only the direct object of the transaction\r\nthat\nis relevant. If the direct object is not the provision of\r\nfinancial assistance by the company for the purpose of or in\r\nconnection\nwith a purchase of its shares, then it is irrelevant that\r\nthe ultimate goal of the transaction was to enable a person to\r\npurchase\nsuch shares. Moreover, financial assistance within the\r\nmeaning of s 38(1) is given only when the direct object of the\r\ntransaction\nis to assist another financially – the s 38\r\nprohibition is not contravened when the direct object of the\r\ntransaction is merely\nto give another that to which he or she is\r\nalready entitled.'\nFurthermore, In\nGradwell (Pty)\r\nLtd v Rostra Printers Ltd and Another\n1959\r\n(4) SA 419\n(A) at 425E Schreiner JA said:\n'The question whether it was to\r\ngive financial assistance would depend not on how it obtained the\r\nmoney – by loan, secured\nor not, by realising assets or\r\notherwise – but on what it was to do with the money when\r\navailable.'\n[23] It is clear from the above that s 38 is fact-based\r\nand that without the necessary facts a court cannot make a finding on\r\nwhether\ns 38 was contravened or not. In\nTransnet\r\nLtd v Rubenstein\n2006 (1) SA 591\n(SCA) at\r\npara 28 Cloete JA said:\n'In motion proceedings the\r\naffidavits constitute not only the evidence, but also the pleadings.'\nSee also\nMinister of Land Affairs\r\n& Agriculture v D & F Wevell Trust\n2008\r\n(2) SA 184\n(SCA) at 200D-E and\nEskom Holdings\r\nLtd v New Reclamation Group (Pty) Ltd\n2009\r\n(4) SA 628\n(SCA) at 638C-F. In\nYannakou v\r\nApollo Club\n1974 (1) SA 614\n(A) at 623G-H\nTrollip JA said:\n'And if his defence is\r\nillegality, which does not appear ex facie the transaction sued on\r\nbut arises from its surrounding circumstances,\nsuch illegality and\r\nthe circumstances founding it must be pleaded. It is true that it is\r\nthe duty of the court to take the point\nof illegality mero motu, even\r\nif the defendant does not plead or raise it; but it can and will only\r\ndo so if the illegality appears\nex facie the transaction or from the\r\nevidence before it, and in the latter event, if it is also satisfied\r\nthat all the necessary\nand relevant facts are before it.'\nSee also\nF & I Advisors\r\n(Edms) Bpk v Eerste Nasionale Bank van SA Bpk\n[1998] ZASCA 65\n;\n1999\r\n(1) SA 515\n(A) at 525H-526A and 526D-E, and\nMiddleton\r\nv Carr\n1949 (2) SA 374\n(A) at 385-386.\n[24] In this matter, it is plain that all the facts are\r\nnot before court to enable the court to determine whether or not s 38\r\nhas\nbeen contravened. The court a quo, for example, itself said:\n'Die betrokke verbandaktes,\r\ngelees met die res van die stukke voor die hof, toon ook nie dat\r\nenige bedrag daarkragtens opeisbaar\nen betaalbaar was deur appellant\r\naan respondent nie. Klousule 6 van die verbandaktes bepaal voorts dat\r\ndie terugbetaling van enige\nbedrag wat deur appellant aan respondent\r\nverskuldig is uit hoofde van die betrokke verbande, moet geskied\r\nooreenkomstig sodanige\nskriftelike ooreenkoms(te) as wat van tyd tot\r\ntyd deur appellant en respondent aangegaan mag word. Respondent steun\r\negter nie op\nenige sodanige ooreenkoms(te) om te toon dat appellant\r\nenige bedrag uit hoofde van die dekkingsverbande aan respondent\r\nverskuldig\nis nie. Dit volg dus dat appellant, as verbandgewer, geen\r\nskuld teenoor respondent gehad het om te vereffen nie.\nIn die omstandighede kan dit nie\r\nbevind word dat die direkte doel (of minstens die mede-direkte doel)\r\nvan die termynleningsooreenkoms\nvan 8 Desember 2005, was om appellant\r\nse skuld as verbandgewer teenoor respondent te vereffen nie.'\nWithout having the relevant facts before it, it was\r\nincorrect for the court a quo to find that the loan agreement\r\ncontravenes s\n38; nor could it have been expected of Absa to produce\r\ndocuments relevant to the question whether there had been such a\r\ncontravention,\nas this was not the case Absa was called upon to meet.\n[25] My view is that the order of the court of first\r\ninstance was correct and Absa's appeal should succeed.\n[26] In the court a quo, Absa was represented by two\r\ncounsel and I believe that they are entitled to the costs of the two\r\ncounsel.\n[27] The following order is made:\n(a) The appeal succeeds with costs which will include\r\ncosts consequent upon the employment of two counsel.\n(b) The order of the court a quo is set aside and\r\nreplaced with the following:\n'The appeal is dismissed with costs, which costs will\r\ninclude the costs consequent upon the employment of two counsel.'\n__________\nW L SERITI\nJUDGE EOF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for Appellant: R S van Riet SC\nP de B Vivier\nInstructed by: Heyns & Partners Inc, Goodwood\nSymington & de Kok, Bloemfontein\nCounsel for Respondent N J Treurnicht SC\nInstructed by: Hanlie Visser Attorneys, Somerset West\nWebbers, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "Kernsig 17 (Pty) Ltd owned Karoovlakte farm, which was mortgaged by six covering bonds in favour of Absa. The Greyling brothers, directors of Kernsig, operated a partnership on the farm that borrowed from Absa. In 2005 the brothers agreed to sell the farm and the company to the Barnards, who would assume the partnership's debts. Kernsig obtained a R1.1 million loan from Absa, secured by the existing mortgage bonds. The Barnards later repudiated the sale and vacated the farm. Kernsig subsequently sought cancellation of the mortgage bonds, alleging the loan contravened section 38 of the Companies Act because it amounted to financial assistance for the purchase of shares.",
    "issues": "Whether the loan agreement entered into between Absa and Kernsig on 8 December 2005 contravened section 38(1) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, which prohibits a company from giving financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares.",
    "principles": "Section 38 aims to protect creditors and minority shareholders by preventing a company’s funds from being used to finance the purchase of its own shares. The court considered precedents such as Lewis v Oneanate, Gardner & Another v Margo, Lipschitz NO v UDC Bank, Gradwell v Rostra Printers, and the distinction between the \"direct object\" of a transaction and its ultimate purpose. The provision is fact‑based; a finding of contravention requires evidence that the loan’s direct object was to assist in acquiring shares.",
    "application": "The court found that the record lacked the necessary facts to determine the direct object of the loan. The lower court had decided the loan contravened section 38 without having the factual basis required. Consequently, the appellate court held that it was incorrect for the court a quo to find a contravention and that Absa could not be required to produce additional documents.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded; the order of the Western Cape High Court was set aside and replaced with a judgment in favour of Absa. The loan agreement was not held to contravene section 38, and Absa’s costs, including those for two counsel, were awarded."
