The issue raised on exception is a\r\nnarrow one, namely whether the appellant’s\ndemand for the\r\nsubmission of such accounts and the debatement thereof has any basis\r\nin law. The attack upon the appellant’s\ncause of action, as\r\npleaded, is that the appellant as a municipal council is not vested\r\nwith powers to estimate levies or demand\ndebatement of accounts from\r\nlevypayers, who are in default. That power resides with the\r\nCommissioner of the South African Revenue\nService.\n1\n[2] In its particulars of claim\r\nthe appellant claimed the following relief:\n‘\n1.\r\nThe defendant be ordered to render to the plaintiff within sixty (60)\r\ndays from the date of the order, a true and proper statement\nof\r\naccount together with substantiating documents reflecting the\r\ncorrect;\ntotal amount of all\r\n\tremuneration paid or which became payable by the defendant to any\r\n\temployee;\ntotal amount of all\r\n\tdrawings taken by defendant;\ntotal sum of all\r\n\tincome or amounts received by or accrued to the defendant in\r\n\trelation to any leviable transaction or consideration\nas defined\n2\nincluding but not\r\n\tlimited to the sale and/or letting of goods or fixed property, the\r\n\trendering of any service and/or the gross\namounts received from a\r\n\tfinancial enterprise during any and every month, effective from 1\r\n\tMarch 2000, any remuneration was so\npaid or so became payable, any\r\n\tdrawings was so taken or any income was so received or so accrued as\r\n\tcontemplated in paragraph\n9(1)(a) and (b) of R340/1987.\nThat the defendant\r\n\tbe ordered to debate the said account with the plaintiff within\r\n\tsixty (60) days from the time such account\nwas rendered in terms of\r\n\tprayer 1 above.\nPayment to the\r\n\tplaintiff of whatever amount appears to be due to the plaintiff upon\r\n\tdebatement of the account.\nPayment of the\r\n\tamount of\nR 33 104,46 (Rudnat CC) / R184 081,29 (Steyn Enslin et\r\n\tal) / R184 081,29 (Afgri Pty Ltd)\n, in the event of the\r\n\tdefendant’s non-compliance with prayers 1, 2 and 3 above;\nPayment of interest\r\n\ton the aforesaid amount in prayer 3 or 4 above at a rate of:\n10.5% per annum\r\n\tfrom 1 July 2006 till 31 October 2006;\n11% per annum from\r\n\t1 November 2006 till 28 February 2007;\n12% per annum from\r\n\t1 March 2007 till 29 February 2008;\n(iv) 14% per annum\r\nfrom 1 March 2008 till date of payment.’\n[3] The respondents excepted to\r\nthe particulars of claim on the basis that the facts pleaded did not\r\nsustain a valid cause of action.\nThey contend that the legislature\r\nhas not vested the appellant with powers to estimate levies or demand\r\nan account or debatement\nof it from levypayers who are in default.\n[4] The appellant’s\r\nresponse was that if the appellant as a municipal council had no such\r\npowers, the common law ought to\nbe developed in terms of s 39(2) of\r\nthe Constitution to vest them with such powers.\n[5] The high court accepted the\r\nrespondents’ contention that no cause of action had been\r\ndisclosed in the appellant’s\nparticulars of claim and upheld\r\nthe exception. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this\r\ncourt, but confined to the question\nof whether it was necessary for\r\nthe common law to be developed in terms of s 39(2) of the\r\nConstitution to vest a municipal council\nwith powers enabling it to\r\ndemand delivery of a statement of account from levy payers and\r\ndefendants in litigation and the debatement\nthereof as an extension\r\nof the procedural remedy in litigation. This would essentially amount\r\nto an extension of the statutory\nobligation of a levypayer to provide\r\na declaration of its business and to provide monthly returns in\r\nrespect of the calculation\nof its liability.\n[6] The issue on appeal, as set\r\nout in the heads of argument, was whether the appellant’s claim\r\nthat the respondents should\naccount, debate and pay the levies due to\r\nthe Regional Council Service, had any basis in law. During argument\r\nthe appellant changed\ntack and confined itself to the right to press\r\nfor a return rendered by the respondents who, it argued, were obliged\r\nto submit\nit in terms of regulation 9(4).\n3\nCounsel for the appellant further\r\nargued as follows: The right to claim levies includes the right to\r\nhave the return rendered by\na levypayer in terms of regulation 9(4).\r\nThe appellant requires the return in order to determine the amount of\r\nlevies owing to\nit by the respondents. The scheme of the regulations\r\nis such that if a levypayer failed to submit a return, the council is\r\nentitled\nto make an assessment of what is owed to it. If regulation\r\n13(1), (discussed below), forbids the submission and production of\r\nthe\ntaxpayer’s books, records, accounts or other documents, at\r\nthe instance of the council, the court should use its common law\n\npower to order the payer, to furnish the return. If the common law is\r\ndeficient, it should be developed in terms of s 39(2) of\nthe\r\nConstitution, to vest the court with the power to order a reluctant\r\nlevypayer to submit such a return.\n[7] It was never the appellant’s\r\ncase, on the pleadings, that it required the submission of a return\r\nby the respondents. The\nappellant’s claim, as indicated in\r\nparticulars of claim to which exception was taken, was for a\r\nstatement of account, debatement\nof it and other documents reflecting\r\nthe amounts owing to the appellant. What hindered the appellant in\r\nits demand for the production\nof the required documents was\r\nregulation 13(1) which reads as follows:\n‘\n13\r\nPowers of council and Commissioner\nA council shall be\r\n\t\tresponsible for the administration of the provisions of this\r\n\t\tSchedule, but shall not be empowered to require\nany person to\r\n\t\tproduce any books, records, accounts or other documents in relation\r\n\t\tto any regional services levy and regional\nestablishment levy or to\r\n\t\trequire any levypayer to substantiate any return submitted by him\r\n\t\tin connection with any such levy.’\n[8] On the case as pleaded,\r\nespecially having regard to the fact that the matter came before the\r\nhigh court on exception,\n4\nthe appeal cannot succeed in\r\nlight of the provision of regulation 13(1).\n[9] Upon realising the\r\ndifficulties posed by regulation 13(1), the appellant resorted to\r\ndemanding, not a statement of accounts\nand debatement but a ‘return’.\r\nIn this regard regulation 9 is relevant. It provides:\n‘\n(3)\r\nEvery payment of regional services levy or regional establishment\r\nlevy shall be accompanied by a return in such form as the\ncouncil may\r\ndetermine.\nEvery person who\r\n\t\tis registered as a levypayer under the provisions of paragraph 10,\r\n\t\tshall within the period allowed by subparagraph\n(1) or (2) furnish\r\n\t\tthe council with the return referred to in subparagraph (3) in\r\n\t\trespect of every month or other period, as\nthe case may be, whether\r\n\t\tor not any relevant levy is payable in respect of such month or\r\n\t\tperiod.’\n[10] The respondents do not\r\ndispute that the appellant was entitled to the return in terms of\r\nregulation 9(4) but submit that this\nwas not the appellant’s\r\npleaded case. Their contention is borne out by the pleadings. Had it\r\nbeen otherwise the matter might\nhave ended without the present\r\nappeal. There is nothing preventing the appellant from seeking a\r\nmandamus in respect of the return.\nThe respondents conceded as much\r\nin argument.\n[11] However, during argument it\r\nalso became clear that the appellant is not sure what amount, if any,\r\nis owing to it by the respondents.\nThe dilemma in which the appellant\r\nfound itself was that it no longer has the power to estimate the\r\namount of levy owing to it.\nThe regulation which empowered it to do\r\nso, (regulation 11(1)) was struck down by this court in\nCity of\r\nTshwane Metropolitan Municipality v Cable City (Pty) Ltd\n2010 (3)\r\nSA 589\n(SCA) as being invalid for inconsistency with the empowering\r\nprovisions. Regulation 11(1) read as follows:\n‘\nWhere\r\nany registered levypayer has failed to furnish any return referred to\r\nin paragraph 9(4) within the relevant period allowed,\nthe council\r\nconcerned may estimate the amount of any levy which, in its opinion,\r\nis probably payable in respect of the relevant\nmonth or period, and\r\nmay make an assessment of the amount of the unpaid levy.’\n[12] The mere submission of a\r\nreturn would consequently not prove a certain solution to the\r\nappellant’s difficulties. In the\ncircumstances the statute\r\nprovides the remedy viz an assessment by the Commissioner in terms of\r\nregulation 13.\n[13] The argument in favour of\r\nthe development of the common law in terms of s 39(2) of the\r\nConstitution, though not abandoned,\nwas not pressed by counsel for\r\nthe appellant. I think Mocumie J, in her short pithy judgment,\r\nhandled the question of whether the\ncommon law should be developed in\r\na sound and judicious way. I cannot fault this aspect of her\r\njudgment. The law on the subject\nis perfectly clear. A municipal\r\ncouncil is not empowered to assess levies owed to it. If it wishes to\r\nhave them assessed it has\nto request the Commissioner to conduct an\r\nassessment as required by regulation 13. There is no valid reason for\r\nthis court to develop\nthe common law when the wording of the\r\nlegislation on the subject is clear and sufficient. To do so would be\r\nto embark on overzealous\njudicial reform against which the\r\nConstitutional Court has warned (\nCarmichele v Minister of Safety\r\nand Security\n[2001] ZACC 22\n;\n2001 (4) SA 938\n(CC) para 55).\n[14] It follows that there is no\r\nmerit in the appeal and, in my view, the exception was correctly\r\nupheld by the high court.\n[15] In the result the following\r\norder is made:\nThe appeal is dismissed with\r\ncosts, save that the appellant may, if so advised, within 30 days\r\nhereof give notice of intention to\namend its particulars of claim.\n___________________\nK K MTHIYANE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES\nFor Appellant: KJ Kemp SC (with\r\nhim C Ploos van Amstel SC)\nInstructed by:\nPodbielski Mhlambi Inc, Welkom\nHoney Attorneys, Bloemfontein\nFor 1\nst,\n2\nnd\nand\r\n3\nrd\nRespondents: FWA Danzfuss SC\nLovius Block, Bloemfontein\n1\nSee\r\n\ts 12(1A)(dA)(iii) and (iv) of the Regional Services Council Act 109\r\n\tof 1985.\n2\nSee\r\n\tparagraph 1 of the regulations promulgated under R340/1957.\n3\nCalculation\r\n\tand payment of Regional Services Levy and Regional Establishment\r\n\tLevy GN R340, 17 February 1987.\n4\nBurger\r\n\tv Rand Water Board & another\n2007\r\n\t(1) SA 30\n(SCA) para 4.",

    "facts": "The appellant, Thabo Mofutsanyana District Municipality, sought from three registered regional services levy payers – Steyn‑Enslin & Vennote, Rudnat (Pty) Ltd and AfGRI (Pty) Ltd – a true and proper statement of account, the debatement of that account and supporting documents, together with payment of alleged levy arrears. The claim was brought under the Regional Services Council Act and associated regulations. The respondents raised an exception, arguing that the municipality lacked statutory authority to demand such accounts or to assess levies, a power that, according to them, reside with the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service. The High Court agreed, holding that regulation 13(1) expressly prohibits a council from requiring books, records, accounts or other documents, and that regulation 11(1), which once allowed estimation of levies, had been struck down as unconstitutional.",
    "issues": "The principal issue on appeal was whether a municipal council has any legal basis to compel levy payers to provide a statement of account and to demand debatement of that account, or whether the common law must be developed under section 39(2) of the Constitution to vest the council with such powers. A subsidiary issue concerned whether the council could instead compel the levy payers to submit a return under regulation 9(4).",
    "principles": "The Court applied the clear wording of regulation 13(1), which bars councils from requiring any books, records, accounts or documents in relation to regional services levies. It noted that regulation 11(1), previously used to estimate levies when returns were not furnished, had been declared invalid in City of Tshwane v Cable City (2010) for inconsistency with empowering provisions. The Court reiterated that common law may only be developed under s 39(2) where legislation is ambiguous or silent, and that judicial over‑reach is discouraged (see Carmichele v Minister of Safety). Accordingly, where the statute expressly limits council powers, no common‑law development is warranted.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court held that the municipality’s claim for a statement of account and its debatement was unsupported by any statutory authority. Regulation 13(1) directly prohibits the council from demanding the documents sought. Although regulation 9(4) grants the council a right to receive a return from levy payers, the appellant’s pleadings did not request such a return, and the council could only obtain an assessment of unpaid levies from the Commissioner as provided by regulation 13. Therefore, the appellant could not succeed on its current claim and there was no basis to expand council powers via common‑law development.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The appellant was given permission, if advised, to give notice within 30 days of its intention to amend its particulars of claim."
