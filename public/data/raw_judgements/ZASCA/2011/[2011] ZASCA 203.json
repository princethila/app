The only live issue in the appeal is who\r\nshould\npay the costs in this court.\n[2] The second respondent, the executors who have been\r\ncited jointly, submit that these costs should be paid by the\r\nappellant as,\nwe were informed, he had persisted in seeking final\r\nrelief on motion before the court a quo up until the fifth day of the\r\nhearing\nin that court; and in the alternative, the submission was\r\nthat the appropriate order should be that the costs of appeal should\r\nbe costs in the cause. To my mind, the decisive fact is that the\r\nappellant had to come to this court to have the order of the court\na\r\nquo set aside and that entitles him to the costs of appeal.\n[3] The following order is made:\n1 The order by the court a quo is set aside and the\r\nfollowing order substituted:\n'(a) The matter is referred to trial.\n(b) The notice of motion shall stand as a simple\r\nsummons.\n(c) The applicant is ordered to deliver his declaration\r\nwithin 21 days from the date of this order (provided that the days\r\nbetween\n16 December and 15 January, both inclusive, shall not be\r\ncounted as part of this period).\n(d) The second respondent, the executors, are ordered to\r\ndeliver their plea within 21 days of the date of delivery of the\r\napplicant's\ndeclaration (subject to the same proviso contained in\r\n(c), should the declaration be delivered before or during the period\r\nspecified\nin the proviso).\n(e) Thereafter the proceedings shall be governed by the\r\nUniform Rules of Court.\n(f) The costs to date shall be costs in the cause.\n(g) The applicant is directed to serve a copy of this\r\norder on the respondents other than the second respondent and the\r\ncosts in\nconnection therewith shall be costs in the cause.'\n2 The second respondent, the executors, are ordered to\r\npay the appellant's costs of appeal, including the costs of two\r\ncounsel\n_______________\nT D CLOETE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nAPPELLANTS: P Levenberg SC (with him P Strathern)\nInstructed by Jay Mothobi Inc, Johannesburg\nE G Cooper & Majiedt Inc, Bloemfontein\nSECOND RESPONDENTS: P Pauw SC (with him Ms C Hartford\r\nSC)\nInstructed by Rachbuch & Associates,\nJohannesburg\nLovius Block Attorneys, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, Martin Rosenberg, appealed a decision of the North West High Court (Mmabatho) where a procedural order had been made. The appeal primarily concerned the allocation of costs incurred in the prior proceedings. The High Court had previously ordered certain procedural steps, and the appellant sought to have that order set aside and the matter referred to trial.",
    "issues": "The sole issue in the appeal was the determination of which party should bear the costs of the appeal, specifically whether the appellant should be awarded costs or the second respondent (the executors) should bear them.",
    "principles": "The court applied the principle that a party who successfully obtains a reversal of a lower court's order on appeal is ordinarily entitled to the costs of the appeal. Additionally, the court noted that costs may be awarded as costs in the cause when the matter proceeds to trial, and that the Uniform Rules of Court govern subsequent procedural steps.",
    "application": "Applying the above principles, the court found that the appellant had to approach the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the High Court's order set aside, thereby entitling him to the costs of appeal. Consequently, the court set aside the High Court order, substituted new procedural orders, and ordered the second respondent (the executors) to pay the appellant's costs of appeal, including counsel fees.",
    "conclusion": "The order by the High Court was set aside and replaced with a series of directions: the matter was referred to trial; the notice of motion was to stand as a simple summons; specific timeframes were set for the applicant's declaration and the second respondent's plea; the Uniform Rules of Court would govern the proceedings; costs to date were deemed costs in the cause; and the second respondent was ordered to pay the appellant's costs of appeal, including two counsel's fees."
