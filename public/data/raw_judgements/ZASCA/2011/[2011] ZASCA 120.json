The appeal is upheld in part.\n2. That part of the order of the\r\ncourt below dismissing the application to declare invalid the\r\nmarriage between the deceased and\nthe first respondent is set aside\r\nand substituted with the following:\n‘\nThe\r\nmarriage contracted between the first respondent and the deceased on\r\n17 January 1997 is declared null and void.’\n3.

The appeal is otherwise\r\ndismissed.\n___________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\nPETSE AJA (MPATI P, BOSIELO,\r\nTSHIQI and SERITI JJA concurring)\n[1] The appellant (as third\r\napplicant in the court a quo), together with two other persons who do\r\nnot feature in this appeal, instituted\nproceedings against the\r\nrespondents in which they sought, in the main, an order declaring:\r\n(a) the marriage between the first respondent\nand the late Mr Masewa\r\nJoseph Netshituka, contracted on 17 January 1997, null and void ab\r\ninitio, and (b) the last will and testament\nof the late Masewa Joseph\r\nNetshituka, executed on 20 November 2007, invalid. The late Masewa\r\nNetshituka (the deceased) died on\n4 January 2008.\n[2] The proceedings were opposed\r\nby the first and third respondents only. The court a quo (Hetisani J)\r\ndismissed the application\nwith costs. This appeal is with its leave.\r\nI shall, for the sake of convenience, refer to the first and third\r\nrespondents simply\nas the respondents.\n[3] A brief factual background\r\ngiving rise to the proceedings in the court a quo is necessary.\r\nTshinakaho Netshituka, who was the\nfirst applicant before the court a\r\nquo but has since died, averred in her founding affidavit that she\r\nwas married to the deceased\nby customary rites on 1 December 1956.\r\nThis marriage was not registered with the Department of Home Affairs.\r\nI shall, for convenience,\nrefer to her as ‘Tshinakaho’.\n[4] According to Tshinakaho the\r\ndeceased was also married by customary rites to three other women,\r\nnamely Masindi, Martha and Diana\nNetshituka, whose marriages were\r\nlikewise not registered. A number of children were born of these\r\ncustomary marriages, the appellant\nbeing one of them. She was born of\r\nthe union between the deceased and Masindi. The first respondent was\r\nalso married to the deceased\nby civil rites, the marriage having been\r\ncontracted on 17 January 1997.\n[5] Following the death of the\r\ndeceased the appellant and her erstwhile co-applicants learnt from\r\nthe first respondent that the\ndeceased had executed a will and that\r\nthe first respondent had been appointed executrix of his estate. Upon\r\nobtaining a copy of\nthe will they took a decision, on legal advice,\r\nto contest the validity of both the will and the deceased’s\r\nmarriage to the\nfirst respondent.\n[6] The validity of the marriage\r\nwas contested on the grounds that it fell foul of the provisions of s\r\n22(1) of the Black Administration\nAct 38 of 1927 (the Act), read with\r\ns 1(a) of the Marriage and Matrimonial Property Law Amendment Act 3\r\nof 1988 regard being had\nto the fact that Tshinakaho’s\r\ncustomary marriage and those of the other three customary law wives\r\nto the deceased, respectively,\nwere recognised in terms of\nss 2(1)\nand (3) of the\nRecognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998\n.\r\nThe validity of the will was contested on account of the deceased’s\r\nchronic state of ill-health and alleged incapacity to\nmanage his own\r\naffairs at the time the will was executed. It was contended that this\r\nstate of affairs was borne out by the fact\nthat the deceased had (i)\r\npurported to bequeath property of which he was not the owner; (ii)\r\npurported to dispose of only a half-share\nof what he believed was his\r\nand the first respondent’s joint estate; and (iii) the alleged\r\nvagueness of some of the provisions\nof the will.\nThe validity of the marriage\n[7] The first respondent averred,\r\nin her answering affidavit, that she married the deceased by civil\r\nrites on 17 January 1997 in\ncommunity of property, at a time when\r\nthere was no impediment to her contracting a lawful marriage with\r\nhim. She responded as follows\nto the allegation that Tshinakaho and\r\nthree other women were married to the deceased by custom:\n‘\nI deny\r\nthe existence of the customary marriage and more specifically that it\r\nexisted at the time when the deceased and I got married.\nThe deceased\r\nwas married to Martha Mosele Netshituka (born Lebona) and got\r\ndivorced from her on 5 July 1984.’\n1\nIt was accordingly contended, on\r\nher behalf, that when she married the deceased on 17 January 1997 the\r\nlatter was not a partner\n‘to a valid existing customary union’\r\nin that any customary union to which the deceased may previously have\r\nbeen a\npartner ‘was terminated by force of law in accordance\r\nwith section 22 of the Act when he married Martha by civil rites’.\n\nIt was submitted further that s22(2) of the Act, which provided that\r\nno person who was a partner in a customary union ‘shall\nbe\r\ncompetent to contract a marriage [with another woman] during the\r\nsubsistence of that union’, had no application to the\nfirst\r\nrespondent’s marriage to the deceased. This was because\r\nwhatever customary union may have subsisted was rendered invalid\nwhen\r\nthe deceased married Martha Mosele Netshituka (Martha) by civil\r\nrites.\n[8] For these submissions counsel\r\nfor the respondents relied on the decision of this court in\nNkambula\r\nv Linda\n2\nwhere it was held that:\n‘\n[a] man\r\nwho is a partner to a customary union and subsequently contracts a\r\ncivil marriage with another woman during the subsistence\nof the\r\ncustomary union must be regarded by this act as having deserted his\r\nwife, and under these circumstances the woman to the\ncustomary union\r\nis justified in leaving her husband without rendering her guardian\r\nliable for a refund of the lobola [dowry].’\n3\nEarlier in the judgment this\r\ncourt held that the Act ‘does not contemplate the existence\r\nside by side of a civil marriage\nand a customary union’.\n4\n[9] At the time the deceased\r\nwould have married Martha by civil rites s 22(1) of the Act read\r\nthus:\n‘\nNo male\r\n[African] shall, during the subsistence of any customary union\r\nbetween him and any woman, contract a marriage with any other\nwoman\r\nunless he has first declared upon oath, before the magistrate or\r\nnative commissioner of the district in which he is domiciled,\nthe\r\nname of every such first-mentioned woman; the name of every child of\r\nany such customary union; the nature and amount of the\nmovable\r\nproperty (if any) allotted by him to each such woman or house under\r\nnative custom; and such other information relating\nto any such union\r\nas the said official may require.’\nThe subsection thus permitted a\r\nman who was a partner in a customary union to contract a civil\r\nmarriage with another woman provided\nhe complied with its provisions.\n[10] A number of academic writers\r\nand commentators hold the view that the effect of\nNkambula\nwas that where one partner in a\r\ncustomary union contracted a civil marriage with someone other than\r\nhis or her partner in the union\nthe civil marriage automatically\r\nterminated the customary union.\n5\nIn\nNkambula\nthe respondent’s customary\r\nlaw wife, Lena, left him after he had entered into a civil marriage\r\nwith another woman. The respondent\nclaimed that Lena had, by leaving\r\nhim, dissolved the customary union, thereby entitling him to a refund\r\nof the lobola he had paid\nfor her. The Commissioner’s Court\r\nupheld his claim and ordered Lena to return to him, failing which her\r\nfather (the appellant)\nwas to return the lobola as prayed, with\r\ncosts. On appeal to it the Native Appeal Court dismissed the appeal\r\nand ordered further\nthat upon failure of Lena to return to her\r\nhusband within one month ‘the customary union is dissolved’.\r\nThe President\nof the appeal court, however, viewing the matter as one\r\nof importance, referred the following question for this court’s\r\nconsideration:\n‘\nWhether\r\nor not a man who is a partner to a customary union and subsequently\r\ncontracts a civil marriage with another woman during\nthe subsistence\r\nof the customary union can be regarded as having deserted his\r\ncustomary union wife, and whether under these circumstances\nthe woman\r\nto the customary union is justified in leaving her husband without\r\nher guardian becoming liable for a refund of the lobola.\nThe question\r\nwas answered in the affirmative (see the excerpt from this court’s\r\njudgment in paragraph 8 above).\n[11] It appears to have been\r\ncommon cause before the court below that in the instant matter the\r\ncustomary law wives of the deceased\nnever left him after he had\r\nmarried Martha by civil rites, but continued with their roles as his\r\ncustomary law wives. The question\nto be answered in these\r\ncircumstances is: What was the status of the relationship between the\r\ndeceased and his ‘deserted’\ncustomary law wives after his\r\ncivil marriage to Martha was terminated by divorce?\n[12] In customary law, where a\r\nhusband has deserted his wife his offence is not irreparable and does\r\nnot give her the right to refuse\nto return to him when he comes to\nphuthuma\n6\nher. It was held in\nBobotyane\r\nv\nJack\n1944 NAC (C & O) 9\n7\nthat customary law ‘does\r\nnot recognise a dissolution of the union by mere desertion of the\r\nwife or husband, by abandonment,\nor even by bare repudiation, for\r\nthese are all eventualities provided for by the lobola cattle; the\r\nhusband can always “\nputuma\n”\nhis wife after any length of\r\nabsence; the wife can always return to her husband’s kraal and\r\nresume her former status’.\n8\nBut on the authority of\nNkambula\na customary law wife who has left\r\nher husband as a result of his having contracted a civil marriage\r\nwith another woman would be\nentitled to refuse to return to him when\r\nhe goes to\nphuthuma\nher. She would be entitled to\r\nassert that he had terminated the union between them. It seems to me,\r\nhowever, that nothing would\nprevent her from returning to him if she\r\nwas prepared to do so. No fresh lobola negotiations would have to be\r\nundertaken because\ncustomary law ‘does not recognize a\r\ndissolution of the union by mere desertion’.\n9\nThe husband might be called upon\r\nby her guardian to pay a beast or more as a penalty for his\r\n‘misdeed’.\n10\n[13] In the present matter the\r\ndeceased did not have to\nphuthuma\nhis customary law wives because\r\nthey never left him after he had married Martha. His continued\r\ncohabitation with them after the\ndivorce was clear evidence of a\r\nhusband who had reconciled with his ‘previously deserted’\r\nwives. And in his last will\nand testament, the validity of which I\r\nshall consider presently, the deceased refers to Tshinakaho, Diana\r\nand the first respondent\nas his first, second and third wives\r\nrespectively. What is important, in my view, is the intention of the\r\nparties, which can be\ninferred from their conduct of simply\r\ncontinuing with their relationships and roles as partners in\r\ncustomary unions with the deceased\nafter the divorce. Their conduct\r\nclearly indicated that to the extent that the deceased’s civil\r\nmarriage to Martha may have\nterminated his unions with his customary\r\nlaw wives, those unions were revived after the divorce.\n[14] The next question is whether\r\nit was competent for the deceased to contract a civil marriage with\r\nthe first respondent during\nthe subsistence of the customary unions\r\nwith Tshinakaho and Diana Netshituka. Section 22 of the Act was\r\namended by the Marriage\nand Matrimonial Property Law Amendment Act\n11\n,\r\nwhich came into operation on 2 December 1988. After the amendment\r\nsubsections (1) and (2) provided:\n‘\n(1)\r\nA man and a woman between whom a customary union subsists are\r\ncompetent to contract a marriage with each other if the man is\nnot\r\nalso a partner in a subsisting customary union with another woman.\n(2) Subject to\r\nsubsection (1), no person who is a partner in a customary union shall\r\nbe competent to contract a marriage during\nthe subsistence of that\r\nunion.’\nSubsection (3) barred a marriage\r\nofficer from solemnizing the marriage of an African ‘unless he\r\nhas first taken from him a\ndeclaration to the effect that he is not a\r\npartner in a customary union with any woman other than the one he\r\nintends marrying’.\nAnd in terms of the amended subsection (5) a\r\nman who made a false declaration with regard to the existence or\r\notherwise of a customary\nunion between him and any woman made himself\r\nguilty of an offence. A marriage officer could thus not solemnize a\r\nmarriage where\na man intended to marry a woman other than the one\r\nwith whom he was a partner in an existing customary union. That, in\r\nmy view,\nwas the clear intention of the Legislature when it amended s\r\n22 of the Act.\n[15] Subsections (1) to (5) of s\r\n22 of the Act, as amended, were in force as at the date on which the\r\ncivil marriage between the\ndeceased and the first respondent was\r\ncontracted. (The subsections were repealed by the Recognition of\r\nCustomary Marriages Act,\n12\nwhich came into operation on 15\r\nNovember 2000). In\nThembisile\r\nv Thembisile\n13\nBertelsmann J held that a civil\r\nmarriage contracted while the man was a partner in an existing\r\ncustomary union with another woman\nwas a nullity.\n14\nIt was not argued in this court\r\nthat\nThembisile\nwas wrongly decided. It follows\r\nthat the civil marriage between the deceased and the first\r\nrespondent, having been contracted while\nthe deceased was a partner\r\nin existing customary unions with Tshinakaho and Diana, was a\r\nnullity.\nThe validity of the will\n[16] I turn now to the question\r\nwhether the appellant and her erstwhile co-applicants discharged the\r\nonus that rested on them to\nestablish on a balance of probabilities\r\nthat the deceased was not in a sound mental state when he attested to\r\nhis last will and\ntestament on 20 November 2007. In support of the\r\ncontention that the deceased was not in a sound mental state,\r\nTshinakaho attached\nto her founding affidavit a copy of a medical\r\nreport from Dr Chitate, a specialist physician attached to the\r\nLimpopo Mediclinic,\nand a memorandum from the Siloam Hospital. It is\r\napparent from the medical report and memorandum that the deceased was\r\nchronically\nill when he underwent treatment at the two institutions.\r\nThere is, however, no indication that his mental capacity was in any\r\nway\nimpaired. On the contrary, Dr Chitate’s report states\r\nexplicitly that ‘despite being chronically physically ill’\n\nthe deceased was ‘mentally normal and fully conscious, aware of\r\nhis surroundings’ and ‘oriented in time, place\nand\r\nperson’.\n[17] In his report Dr Chitate\r\nstates, however, that ‘episodes of hypoglycaemia had occurred\r\nand, if these recurred after discharge,\ncould have led to a\r\ndeterioration in [the deceased’s] mental function’.\r\nAccording to the report Dr Chitate examined\nand treated the deceased\r\nfrom 12 to 16 November 2007. The memorandum from the Siloam Hospital\r\ncovers the period 30 November 2007,\nthe date of his admission, to 4\r\nJanuary 2008 when he passed away. No mention is made of the\r\ndeceased’s alleged mental incapacity\nin the memorandum. There\r\nis thus no evidence that when he attested to his last will and\r\ntestament on 20 November 2007 the deceased\nwas mentally\r\nincapacitated. The contention that he was, therefore, has no basis.\n[18] As to the allegation that\r\nthe deceased purported to bequeath property of which he was not the\r\nowner and that therefore his\nwill was invalid, counsel for the\r\nappellant conceded that even accepting this to be so it would not\r\nrender the will invalid. Nor\nwould it necessarily point to the\r\ndeceased being mentally incapacitated. The same applies to the\r\nallegation of vagueness in respect\nof certain of the provisions of\r\nthe will. We were in any event not referred to any provision which\r\ncould be said to be vague.\n[19] There remains the issue of\r\ncosts. Counsel for the appellant submitted that if the appeal\r\nsucceeds the first respondent should\npay the costs. On the other hand\r\ncounsel for the respondents argued that it would be fair and\r\nequitable that any costs incurred\nin this matter be paid out of the\r\ndeceased estate. I am satisfied that the argument on behalf of the\r\nrespondents should prevail,\nfor two principal reasons. First, the\r\nappellant has been partially successful. Second, the respondents were\r\nto my mind neither\nunreasonable nor frivolous in opposing the relief\r\nsought.\n[20] The following order is made:\n1. The appeal is upheld in part.\n2. That part of the order of the\r\ncourt below dismissing the application to declare invalid the\r\nmarriage between the deceased and\nthe first respondent is set aside\r\nand substituted with the following:\n‘\nThe\r\nmarriage contracted between the first respondent and the deceased on\r\n17 January 1997 is declared null and void.’\n3. The costs order made by the\r\ncourt below is set aside.\n4. The costs of the appeal and\r\nthe costs of the proceedings in the court below are to be paid by the\r\nthird respondent.\n5. The appeal is otherwise\r\ndismissed.\n____________________\nXM Petse\nActing Judge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT: PM van Ryneveld\nInstructed by De Buys Human\r\nAttorneys, Thohoyandou;\nSymington & De Kok,\r\nBloemfontein.\nRESPONDENTS: GJ Scheepers\nInstructed by Jones Attorneys,\r\nThohoyandou;\nHoney Attorneys, Bloemfontein.\n1\nA\r\n\tcopy of the decree of divorce was annexed to the answering\r\n\taffidavit.

    "facts": "The appellant, together with two other persons, sought a declaration that the civil marriage entered into on 17 January 1997 between the deceased, Masewa Joseph Netshituka, and the first respondent was null and void, and that the deceased’s will dated 20 November 2007 was invalid. The deceased had been married under customary law to several women, including Tshinakaho Netshituka (who claimed a customary marriage in 1956) and others, none of which were registered. The first respondent married the deceased by civil rites while the customary unions were alleged to still exist. After the deceased’s death on 4 January 2008, the appellant and co‑applicants contested the marriage and the will, alleging statutory incompatibility and the deceased’s lack of mental capacity.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the civil marriage contracted on 17 January 1997 was valid given the deceased’s existing customary unions at the time. 2. Whether the deceased possessed the requisite mental capacity to execute a valid will on 20 November 2007, and whether the content of the will rendered it invalid.",
    "principles": "The court applied the Black Administration Act 38 of 1927 as amended by the Marriage and Matrimonial Property Law Amendment Act 3 of 1988, particularly sections 22(1)-(5), which prohibit a man who is a partner in a subsisting customary union from contracting a civil marriage with another woman without a statutory declaration. The precedent Thembisile v Thembisile held that such a civil marriage is a nullity. The earlier case Nkambula v Linda was considered for its view that a civil marriage does not co‑exist with a customary union. The court also considered medical evidence regarding mental capacity, noting that physical illness does not equate to mental incapacity.",
    "application": "The court found that at the time of the 1997 civil marriage the deceased remained a partner in existing customary unions with Tshinakaho and Diana Netshituka. Consequently, under the amended s22 of the Black Administration Act and the authority in Thembisile, the civil marriage was void ab initio. Regarding the will, medical reports showed the deceased was mentally normal and fully conscious when the will was signed, and no evidence indicated incapacity. Allegations of ownership of property and vague provisions did not, in themselves, invalidate the will.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld in part. The marriage between the first respondent and the deceased was declared null and void. The costs order of the lower court was set aside, and the costs of the appeal and of the lower court proceedings were ordered to be paid by the third respondent. The remainder of the appeal was dismissed."
