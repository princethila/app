In his\r\nclaim against the Road Accident Fund (the Fund) his damages\nwere\r\nagreed at R14 million plus his medical costs. In the trial court\r\nMaluleke J apportioned blame for the collision equally, with\nthe\r\nresult that Mr Biddlecombe would be entitled to recover half of the\r\nagreed damages and half of is medical costs. This appeal\nby him, with\r\nthe leave of the trial court, is against that apportionment. There is\r\nno cross-appeal by the Fund.\n[2] Malibongwe Drive is a major arterial road with a\r\ndual carriageway carrying north and southbound traffic in the\r\nvicinity of its\nintersection with River Road. There are two\r\ndemarcated lanes in each carriageway and the carriageways are\r\nseparated by a traffic\nisland. The road is straight with a very\r\nslight upward inclination towards the north. Visibility in a\r\nnortherly direction from\nthe traffic lights at River Road extends for\r\nsome 312 metres. The intersection is a substantial one where the road\r\nwidens to provide\nlanes for traffic from both directions in\r\nMalibongwe Drive to filter left into River Road and similarly to\r\nallow traffic to filter\nleft from both directions in River Road into\r\nMalibongwe Drive. At the intersection there are also additional\r\ndemarcated lanes in\nboth north and southbound carriageways for\r\ntraffic wishing to turn right from Malibongwe Drive into River Road\r\nacross the face\nof oncoming traffic. Each lane in Malibongwe Drive is\r\napproximately 3.5 metres wide. Between the ends of the two traffic\r\nislands\nthe intersection is 21 metres wide, with the stop lines for\r\ntraffic being set back a little over three metres on both sides of\r\nthe intersection.\n[3] The day of the accident was sunny, the road was dry\r\nand visibility was excellent. The traffic lights at the intersection\r\nwere\nin working order. The sequence in which they functioned is\r\nrelevant. Starting from a position where they are red for traffic\r\ntravelling\nin either direction in Malibongwe Drive, there is first a\r\nflashing green turning arrow (referred to in evidence as a leading\r\narrow)\nto enable vehicles coming from either direction to turn right\r\ninto River Road. Through traffic faces a red light during this\r\nperiod.\nAfter thirteen seconds the green turning arrow is replaced by\r\nan amber arrow and after a further four seconds that disappears.\r\nThere is then an interval of two seconds after which the lights for\r\nthrough traffic in both directions change to green and remain\ngreen\r\nfor 24 seconds. During this period there is no turning arrow for\r\ntraffic to turn right into River Drive. Vehicles wishing\nto do so and\r\nturn across oncoming traffic may, however, turn when it is safe for\r\nthem to do so. The lights in both directions then\nturn amber for five\r\nseconds and then red.\n[4] Mr Biddlecombe was returning home after meeting some\r\nmotorcycling friends and travelling south in the lane adjacent to the\r\ntraffic\nisland. His version was as follows. As he approached the\r\nintersection the lights were green in his favour. When he was about\r\n150\nmetres away, he saw Mr Motaung’s truck stop in the turning\r\nlane for traffic from the south wishing to turn right into River\n\nRoad. He says that he was travelling at between 60 and 70 kilometres\r\nper hour (kph), well within the speed limit of 80 kph. He\nassumed\r\nthat, as the truck had stopped, its driver had seen him and, as the\r\nlights were in his favour, he proceeded on the basis\nthat he would\r\ndrive straight through the intersection. When he was about 50 metres\r\naway, the truck pulled off and turned in front\nof him. He braked,\r\nusing his rear brakes only, as he had been taught, but this was\r\ninsufficient to avoid a collision. As a result\nof his braking the\r\nmotorbike skidded and left a skid mark, some 34 metres long, on the\r\nsurface of the road. He has no recollection\nof the accident itself,\r\nonly of its aftermath when he was trapped under the motorbike, which\r\nhad caught fire.\n[5] As one would expect, Mr Motaung’s version of\r\nthe accident corresponded in some respects with that of Mr\r\nBiddlecombe and\ndiffered in others. He agrees that he approached the\r\nintersection from the south and stopped in the turning lane.\r\nAccording to\nhim he did so because the turning arrow, which had been\r\ngreen as he approached, had turned off and so he was not entitled to\r\nturn\nacross oncoming traffic until it was safe to do so. He intended\r\nto turn right into River Road in order to fill up at a nearby service\n\nstation. He says that three vehicles travelling south went through\r\nthe intersection while he was waiting there, the last one as\nthe\r\nlights turned red.\n1\nAt this point he pulled off to complete his right turn\r\nand clear the intersection. He had seen Mr Biddlecombe’s\r\nmotorbike\nwhen it was about one hundred metres away and thought that\r\nit was slowing down and would stop. He had almost completed his turn\n\nand the cab of his vehicle was across the furthest lane of the\r\nsouthbound carriageway when Mr Biddlecombe’s motorbike collided\n\nwith his vehicle in the vicinity of the rear wheels. He was alerted\r\nto the collision by the flames from the fire.\n[6] Apart from Mr Biddlecombe and Mr Motaung the only\r\neyewitness to the collision was Ms van Eeden, who was a passenger in\r\na Renault\nScenic motor vehicle travelling south in the lane behind\r\nthe motorbike, but separated from it by either two or three other\r\nvehicles.\nThe trial judge did not find her a convincing witness. The\r\nfocus of much of the argument before us was on whether he erred in\r\nthis.\nIt was submitted that her evidence should have been accepted as\r\nreinforcing the correctness of Mr Biddlecombe’s version\nof\r\nevents and warranting the rejection of Mr Motaung’s\r\nversion. In particular it was contended that her evidence that\nat the\r\ntime of the collision the traffic light was green for southbound\r\ntraffic should have been accepted and that this should\nhave been\r\ndecisive of the case. I will revert to her evidence in greater detail\r\nin due course.\n[7] Both parties called an expert witness, Mr Grobbelaar\r\nfor Mr Biddlecombe, and Mr Verster for the Fund. Before the\r\nhearing\nthe experts met and prepared a joint minute of matters on\r\nwhich they were agreed. In it they said that the collision occurred\r\nbecause\nthe truck had turned right across the intersection in front\r\nof the lane of travel of the motorbike. They were unable to express\n\nany view on the state of the traffic lights at the time the truck\r\nturned. They inferred from the skid mark that Mr Biddlecombe\nhad seen\r\nthe truck and attempted to avoid a collision by applying his brakes.\r\nThey agreed that when the brakes were applied the\nmotorbike was\r\ntravelling faster than 58 kph on the basis that otherwise, after\r\nskidding for 34.1 metres, it would have come to\na halt before\r\ncolliding with the truck. In order to allow for reaction time they\r\naccepted that Mr Biddlecombe must have seen the\ntruck and realised he\r\nwas in a situation of potential danger one to one and half seconds\r\nprior to the application of his brakes.\nAssuming a reaction time of\r\none second at 58 kph he must have become aware of danger when he was\r\napproximately 50 metres from the\nintersection. If one assumes a\r\nslightly longer reaction time or a higher speed that distance\r\nincreases. In addition in their reports,\nas explained in their oral\r\nevidence, they gave figures on speeds and stopping distances that\r\nwere uncontroversial and unchallenged.\n[8] The trial judge appreciated that there were mutually\r\ndestructive versions given by the eyewitnesses on the state of the\r\ntraffic\nlights at the time of the collision. That raised the question\r\nof the proper approach to such evidence in the light of the expert\n\nevidence. Basing himself upon the decision in\nAbdo\r\nNO v Senator Insurance Company Limited\n2\nhe said that he would provisionally assess whether Mr\r\nBiddlecombe had discharged the onus of proving on a balance of\r\nprobabilities\nthat Mr Motaung had been negligent on the basis of the\r\neyewitness evidence, and then consider and take into account the\r\nexpert\nevidence. In\nAbdo\nKannemeyer\r\nJ said\n3\nthat it was ‘convenient at the outset to consider\r\nthe approach to be adopted if one is faced with both expert evidence\r\nand\nthe testimony of eye witnesses in a case such as this’. He\r\nthen went on as follows:\n‘\nIn\nPutzier v\r\nUnion and South West Africa Insurance Co. Limited\n1973 ECD (unreported) ADDLESON J was faced with such a problem. The\r\ndecision in\nPutzier’s\ncase\r\nwas reversed on appeal on the facts. The judgment of the Appellate\r\nDivision is also not reported but the approach adopted by\nADDLESON J\r\nin the following terms is not questioned therein:\n‘‘\nCounsel did not refer\r\nme to any authority dealing directly with the correct approach to a\r\ndispute between the experts and the eyewitnesses.\nIt seems to me\r\nhowever that unless the opinion of the experts is either\r\nuncontroverted or incontrovertible, one should look first\nat the\r\nevidence of the eyewitnesses, if any. If such eyewitnesses are\r\nunacceptable then naturally the Court is bound to decide,\nif\r\npossible, which of the opinions of the various experts is preferable\r\nand to found its judgment on such opinion. On the other\nhand, where a\r\nchoice can be made on a balance of probabilities and on accepted\r\nprinciples between two sets of eyewitnesses, the\nCourt should first\r\nmake a provisional assessment of which of the versions of the\r\neyewitnesses is acceptable. Having provisionally\naccepted one or\r\nother version, the Court should then consider the\nexpert evidence and decide\r\nwhether that evidence displaces the provisional findings made on the\r\nevidence of the eyewitnesses. In\nthis regard, where the\nonus\nis on the plaintiff and where\r\nthere is a dispute between the experts, it is my view that, if the\r\neyewitnesses favour the plaintiff,\nthe evidence of the defendant must\r\nbe shown to displace that of the plaintiff’s eyewitnesses; but,\r\nif the eyewitnesses favour\nthe defendant, the plaintiff must show\r\nthat the evidence of his experts must be accepted in preference to\r\nthe experts and the eyewitnesses\nfor the defendant. If, at best, the\r\ncourt is left in doubt as to whether the experts for the plaintiff\r\nhave advanced opinions preferable\nto those of the defendant, then it\r\nseems to me that the plaintiff has failed to displace the findings\r\nmade in respect of the eyewitnesses\nand has consequently failed to\r\ndischarge the\nonus\non him.”’\nKannemeyer J adopted that approach subject to a\r\nqualification that ‘in the final result, a decision must be\r\nreached on the\nevidence as a whole and the above approach must be no\r\nmore than a convenient method of analysis of that evidence’.\n[9] However helpful that approach might have been in\nPutzier\nand\nAbdo\n,\r\na matter on which I express no opinion, I share the view expressed in\nStacey v Kent\n,\n4\nthat ‘[i]t may be that the statements are too\r\ngeneral and that one should treat each case on its own merits’.\r\nIn every\ncase it is necessary for the trial judge to identify an\r\nappropriate point at which to commence the analysis of the evidence.\r\nIn\nsome cases that may be the eyewitness evidence, but in others it\r\nmay be more appropriate to commence with the expert evidence. For\n\nexample there may be physical evidence, such as skid marks, collision\r\ndamage to the vehicles, the position of the vehicles after\nthe\r\ncollision or the location of debris that, when viewed in the light of\r\nestablished scientific data, such as the distance that\na motor\r\nvehicle will travel at a particular speed, provides a definitive\r\nfactual background against which to weigh the merits of\nthe\r\neyewitness accounts of what occurred. The evidence of the experts may\r\nbe of great assistance in understanding and giving appropriate\nweight\r\nto this evidence. In such a case, to start with the eyewitness\r\nevidence and reach a provisional conclusion that the expert\nevidence\r\nmust then ‘displace’ burdens the expert testimony with an\r\nonus that is not warranted and separates into two\ndiscrete enquiries\r\nwhat is a single enquiry.\n[10] This is not to say that the caution with which our\r\ncourts have always approached expert evidence on the mechanism by\r\nwhich\nmotor accidents occur and their expressed preference for\r\neyewitness testimony is not on occasions justified. As Eksteen J said\r\nin\nMotor Vehicle Assurance Fund v Kenny\n:\n5\n‘\nDirect\r\nor credible evidence of what happened in a collision, must, to my\r\nmind, generally carry greater weight than the opinion of\nan expert,\r\nhowever experienced he may be, seeking to reconstruct the events from\r\nhis experience and scientific training. Strange\nthings often happen\r\nin a collision and, where two vehicles approaching each other from\r\nopposite directions collide, it is practically\nimpossible for anyone\r\ninvolved in the collision to give a minute and detailed description\r\nof the combined speed of the vehicles\nat the moment of impact, the\r\nangle of contact or of the subsequent lateral or forward movements of\r\nthe vehicles.’\nThe expert tasked with reconstructing what occurred is\r\noften dependent for the reconstruction not simply on the application\r\nof scientific\nprinciple to accurate data but on calculations based on\r\nimperfect human observation. The fact that the reconstruction rests\r\non\na potentially imperfect factual foundation is the reason for\r\ncaution in determining its evidential value.\n6\nHowever, whether that is so in any particular case will\r\ndepend upon an assessment of the degree to which it rests upon\r\nascertainable\nand measurable facts and the application of scientific\r\nprinciples to those facts. It is undesirable for a court to adopt an\na priori\napproach to\r\nits task of weighing eyewitness and expert testimony where the two\r\nconflict.\n[11] In the present case it is convenient to start by\r\nconsidering some of the undisputed factual and expert evidence. That\r\nevidence\nwas based primarily upon photographs and measurements taken\r\nshortly after the accident and secondarily upon measurements and\r\ncalculations\nperformed by the experts at a later stage. The\r\nphotographs showed that the motorbike came to rest in the\r\nintersection at a point\nthat was agreed to be some 15 to 17 metres\r\nfrom the stop line for northbound traffic and therefore some 11 to 13\r\nmetres from the\nstop line for southbound traffic. In other words it\r\noccurred slightly to the northern side of the intersection. The\r\nphotographs\nshow that the motorbike came to rest more or less in\r\nfront of the lane in which Mr Biddlecombe said that he was travelling\r\nprior\nto the collision. Running northward from that point and\r\napproximately in a straight line is the skid mark that was measured\r\nat\n34.1 metres. There are photographs of the truck showing that it is\r\na conventional horse and trailer, the latter having only a double\n\nrear axle and two sets of rear wheels and no front wheels at the\r\npoint where it is supported by the horse. The photographs show\nmarks\r\non the foremost tyre at the rear of the trailer indicating that the\r\npoint of impact was about two to two and a half metres\nfrom the rear\r\nof the truck. That means that the cab and the bulk of the trailer had\r\nalready passed in front of Mr Biddlecombe’s\nmotorbike before\r\nthe collision occurred.\n[12] If one pauses at this stage to compare this\r\nevidence with that of Mr Biddlecombe and Mr Motaung, it shows that\r\nthe accident\noccurred much as they described. It also shows that on\r\neither version of the collision the trial court was correct to find\r\nthat\nMr Motaung was negligent in that he ‘moved rather\r\nprecipitately across the plaintiff’s lane of travel’. On\r\nhis\nown version, even if the lights had changed and Mr Biddlecombe\r\nshould have stopped because the lights were red, he misjudged the\n\nspeed at which the latter was travelling, the distance he had to\r\ncover and both his intentions and his ability to stop. If the\nlights\r\nwere still green for southbound traffic that merely compounded the\r\nproblem, because he had no reason to think that Mr Biddlecombe\nwas\r\nplanning to stop at the intersection. Whilst it was permissible for\r\nhim to turn right in the face of oncoming traffic it was\nnot safe to\r\ndo so. Of course, if, contrary to his evidence, he simply did not see\r\nthe oncoming motorbike, he was equally negligent,\nthe only difference\r\nbeing that the negligence consisted in his failure to keep a proper\r\nlookout.\n[13] That conclusion does not\r\nnecessarily assist Mr Biddlecombe’s case.\nIf one accepts\r\nthat he and Mr Motaung are correct in saying that the truck vehicle\r\nwas stationary at the intersection waiting to\nturn right, that means\r\nthat the truck pulled off from a stationary position and crossed over\r\ntwo and nearly three lanes of the\nsouthbound carriageway before the\r\ncollision occurred. Bearing in mind that it was a fully laden\r\ntwelve-ton vehicle, somewhere between\nten and twelve metres long, and\r\nthat it travelled at least fifteen metres forward and nearly ten\r\nmetres across the intersection,\n7\nit must have been in and moving across the intersection for several\r\nseconds prior to the collision. Such a vehicle is not capable\nof\r\naccelerating rapidly from a stationary position. Assuming in favour\r\nof Mr Biddlecombe that it travelled at an average speed\nof 20 kph,\n8\nit must have taken at least four to five seconds from the time it\r\nstarted moving to the point where his motorbike collided with\nit. In\r\nthat time at an average speed on his part of 40 kph he would have\r\ntravelled between 40 and 50 metres.\n9\nIf the estimate of the truck’s speed is high then it was moving\r\ninto and across the intersection for longer than four to\nfive seconds\r\nand Mr Biddlecombe would have been able to observe it for longer and\r\nfrom a greater distance.\n[14] Once those relatively simple calculations are done,\r\nbased on incontrovertible scientific data as to the time it takes for\r\na\nvehicle to travel a known distance at a particular speed, one\r\nreaches the inevitable conclusion that Mr Biddlecombe could see the\n\ntruck moving into and across his path of travel when he was at least\r\n40 to 50 metres away from the intersection and, making full\nallowance\r\nfor the width of the intersection, some 25 to 30 metres from the stop\r\nline on the northern side. This is not harsh on\nhim because his own\r\nevidence was that he saw the truck start moving when he was some 50\r\nmetres away from the intersection. But\nthen he is faced with the\r\nunchallenged evidence of Mr Verster that at a speed of 60 kph he\r\nshould have been able to stop with normal\nbraking in about 18 metres\r\nand using the rear brakes alone within about 28 metres. At a speed of\r\n65 kph Mr Verster said these distances\nbecame 20 metres and 33 metres\r\nrespectively.\n[15] The inevitable question that arises from this is\r\nwhy Mr Biddlecombe was unable to stop in the ordinary course, with\r\nthe application\nof conventional braking, prior to colliding with the\r\ntruck. The day was clear and his visibility unimpeded. He was aware\r\nof the\ntruck and the fact that it wished to turn right across the\r\nface of oncoming southbound traffic in Malibongwe Drive. The only\r\npossible\nsource of danger to him was if it started to do so before he\r\nhad passed it and cleared the intersection. He should therefore have\n\nkept it under observation. On his own evidence as to the speed he was\r\ntravelling and the time when he observed the truck, he should\nhave\r\nbeen able to stop without any particular problem before a collision\r\noccurred. Only two possible reasons exist for his not\ndoing so. The\r\none is that he was travelling at a much greater speed than he said\r\nand the other is that he was not keeping the truck\nunder proper\r\nobservation and only realised that it was moving much later than he\r\nsaid. It is of course possible that it was a combination\nof both\r\nreasons.\n[16] The conclusion from this is that Mr Biddlecombe was\r\nhimself negligent in one or other or both of the respects I have\r\nmentioned.\nEven if one accepts in his favour that the initial fault\r\nlay with Mr Motaung, this is not a case of a vehicle suddenly\r\nemerging\n‘from nowhere’ in the parlance of many of those\r\ninvolved in motor accidents. It is a situation of a vehicle that is\n\nperfectly visible, and has been visible for some time, starting to\r\ncommence a manoeuvre that it was obvious to oncoming motorists\nit\r\nintended to undertake, and doing so in circumstances where an alert\r\nmotorist driving at a reasonable speed would have been able\nto let it\r\npass in front of him without incident.\n[17] These conclusions are entirely independent of the\r\nstate of the traffic lights at the time of the collision. If they\r\nwere green\nfor southbound traffic, then they were equally green for\r\nnorthbound traffic and Mr Motaung was entitled to turn right across\r\nthe\noncoming traffic if it was safe to do so. Southbound traffic\r\nshould have been aware of this possibility and alert to the risk of\na\r\nvehicle undertaking a turn, having misjudged the distance and speed\r\nof oncoming vehicles, and creating the potential for a collision.\n\nDrivers of southbound vehicles could not proceed on the blithe\r\nassumption that such an event would not happen, as it is one of\nthe\r\nordinary risks of everyday driving. In a perfect world it would not\r\nhappen, but experience teaches us that it does. If the\ntraffic lights\r\nhad changed to red, as Mr Motaung said they had, the position is\r\nreversed. It was perfectly proper for him to expect\nto be able to\r\nproceed to complete his turn before traffic in River Drive could\r\nproceed, but he could not simply assume that traffic\nin Malibongwe\r\nDrive would stop to enable him to do so. The phenomenon of vehicles\r\nspeeding up to try and go through traffic lights\nas they change from\r\ngreen to amber and amber to red is sufficiently commonplace for any\r\ndriver in Mr Motaung’s position to\nrecognise it as a risk and\r\nguard against it.\n[18] If it were necessary to choose between Mr\r\nBiddlecombe and Mr Motaung as to the state of the traffic lights at\r\nthe time of the\ncollision I do not think it would be possible to do\r\nso and I think that the trial court was correct not to do so. The\r\njudge found\nMr Motaung to be ‘a particularly candid, credible\r\nand truthful witness’. There is nothing to refute that finding\r\nand\nit must be afforded the respect that appellate courts always\r\nafford to trial courts on matters of credibility. That is not to say\n\nthat Mr Biddlecombe was an unsatisfactory witness. No such finding\r\nwas or can be made. It simply means that the court was unable\nto\r\nchoose between them in the sense of preferring the version of the one\r\nto that of the other on the basis of the inherent probabilities.\n[19] That brings me to Ms van Eeden’s evidence.\r\nShe said that she and friends or family were on their way to the Rand\r\nShow.\nThey were in a Renault Scenic, a small vehicle of the type\r\npopularly referred to as a ‘people carrier’. It is about\n\nthe same size as a mid-range saloon car with a bench seat in the rear\r\nand a small rear-opening boot. It sits slightly higher off\nthe ground\r\nthan the average saloon car, but a person sitting in one by no means\r\nenjoys the position of vantage of a passenger in\na sports utility\r\nvehicle, of which there are many on our roads, or in the ever-present\r\ntaxis in which most of South Africa’s\nworking population\r\ntravels on a daily basis. There were five adults and two children in\r\nthe car, with Ms van Eeden occupying the\ncentre of the back seat.\n[20] Ms van Eeden said that the Renault Scenic was\r\ntravelling in the same lane as the motorbike and separated from it by\r\ntwo or\nperhaps three other vehicles. Her evidence left the impression\r\nthat all these vehicles had been stationary at a traffic light\r\nfurther\nnorth in Malibongwe Drive and had set off together moving\r\nfairly sedately towards River Drive. When the traffic lights at River\n\nDrive came into view she said that they were red for southbound\r\ntraffic such as themselves, but when they were approximately 200\n\nmetres away they turned green in their favour. According to her this\r\ncaused all the cars to accelerate and her impression was that\nthe\r\nmotorbike accelerated somewhat faster than the cars. In regard to the\r\ncollision between the motorbike and the truck she had\nlittle to say.\r\nShe became aware of the truck turning in front of the motorbike\r\nimmediately prior to the collision, but was not\nconscious of what it\r\nwas doing prior to that. After the collision the motorbike burst into\r\nflame and the vehicle she was in and\nothers in the southbound traffic\r\nstopped on the southern side of the intersection and went to render\r\nassistance. It is unclear\nwhether they first stopped on the northern\r\nside of the intersection and then crossed over when it was safe for\r\nthem to do so, or\nwhether they drove past the scene of the collision\r\nwithout stopping until they had crossed River Drive.\n[21] The one thing about which Ms van Eeden was adamant\r\nwas that the lights had changed to green as they travelled down\r\ntowards\nthem and remained green in favour of southbound traffic up\r\nuntil the time of the collision. It is correct that in this respect\r\nher evidence accords with that of Mr Biddlecombe, but I cannot accept\r\nthat it provides a reason for disregarding the trial judge’s\n\nfavourable credibility findings in regard to Mr Motaung or that it\r\ndisplaces any of the conclusions on negligence set out above,\nwhich I\r\nstress are not dependent upon the state of the traffic lights.\n[22] It was submitted that for Ms van Eeden to be wrong\r\nthere must have been a conspiracy between her and Mr Biddlecombe to\r\nmislead\nthe court in a dishonest fashion. That is incorrect. They\r\ncould both be wrong as a result of honest error on their part. Mr\r\nBiddlecombe\nonly had a partial memory of events, which is quite\r\nunderstandable given the trauma he suffered in consequence of his\r\ninjuries.\nTurning to Ms van Eeden I have sufficiently described the\r\nvehicle in which she was travelling and its situation on the road in\r\nrelation to the motorbike, with other vehicles in between obscuring\r\nher view, for it to be apparent that she did not have an ideal\n\nvantage point to observe matters. Nor was there any reason for her to\r\ndo so as a rear seat passenger in a small and somewhat crowded\nmotor\r\nvehicle. The fact that she was unable to testify about the truck’s\r\nmovements prior to the accident suggests that her\nattention cannot\r\nhave been entirely on the road. The court must bear in mind that in a\r\nstatement she provided to the Metro Police\nDepartment some six weeks\r\nafter the collision it is clearly stated that the driver of the truck\r\ndrove into the intersection in\nfront of the motorbike without\r\nstopping. Both the police report and Mr Grobbelaar’s expert\r\nopinion were furnished on this\nbasis, but her evidence at the trial\r\ndid not support this. The trial court had to be alert to the risk\r\nthat, faced with the undeniable\nfact that the collision occurred\r\nbecause the truck had turned in front of the motorbike, a person\r\ntravelling behind the motorbike\nand having been vaguely aware that\r\nthe traffic lights had been green, might not have noticed that they\r\nhad changed shortly before\nthe collision. What clearly focussed her\r\nattention was the immediate prospect, when she saw the truck moving,\r\nthat there might\nbe a collision. Some significance should also be\r\nattached to the fact that neither the driver nor the front seat\r\npassenger in the\nRenault Scenic were called as witnesses, when they\r\nwould presumably have been in a better position to have seen what\r\nhappened.\nWeighing all this up it seems to me that the prospect of\r\nhonest error cannot be excluded. The argument based on a conspiracy\r\nis\nunsound.\n[23] That leaves a conflict between the witnesses on\r\neither side as to the state of the traffic lights. The trial court\r\nwas unable\nto resolve that conflict and in my view there are no\r\nprobabilities either way that would enable us to disturb that\r\nconclusion.\nAt the end of the day, however, this would only affect\r\nthe extent of the apportionment and not the question of negligence.\r\nWhatever\nthe state of the traffic lights Mr Motaung should not have\r\nsought to cross the intersection when he did. It was not safe to do\r\nso in the light of the oncoming traffic. Equally, given the\r\nuninterrupted visibility and the obvious presence of the truck\r\nintending\nto turn across into River Drive, Mr Biddlecombe should have\r\nbeen alert to the risk that the truck might try to cross when it was\n\nnot safe to do so and been careful to ensure that if it did so he\r\nwould be able to bring his motorbike safely to a halt. As with\nmany\r\ncollisions there was fault on both sides. The trial judge apportioned\r\nit equally and it was not submitted that there were\ngrounds for\r\ninterfering with the exercise of his discretion if his factual\r\nfindings were left undisturbed.\n[24] In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nM\r\nJ D WALLIS\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances\nFor appellant: J J Wessels SC\nInstructed by:\nMunro, Flowers & Vermaak, Johannesburg\nClaude Reid Inc, Bloemfontein\nFor respondent: M Patel\nInstructed\r\nby:\nDe\r\nBuys Human, Johannesburg\nSymington\r\n& De Kok, Bloemfontein.\n1\nThis\r\n\trefers to the lights for through traffic, which are synchronised in\r\n\tthe fashion described in paragraph 3. In other words\nwhen they are\r\n\tred for traffic travelling north they are also red for southbound\r\n\ttraffic.\n2\nAbdo\r\n\tNO v Senator Insurance Company Limited\n1983 (4) SA 721\n(E) at\r\n\t725D-F.\n3\nAt\r\n\t725E.\n4\nStacey\r\n\tv Kent\n1992 (4) SA 495\n(C) at 497C-E.\n5\nMotor\r\n\tVehicle Assurance Fund v Kenny\n1984 (4) SA 432\n(E) at 436H-I.\r\n\tFollowed in\nStacey v Kent\n1995 (3) SA 344\n(E) at 348-349.\n6\nIn\nVan Eck v Santam Insurance Company Limited\n1996 (4) SA 1226\n(C) at 1229 it was said that the expert evidence is ‘inevitably\r\n\tbased on reconstruction’.\n7\nAccording\r\n\tto Mr Grobbelaar’s measurements the total width of the three\r\n\tsouthbound lanes was 10.5 metres. The collision occurred\nno more\r\n\tthan two to two and a half metres from the rear of a truck that was\r\n\tsome 12 metres long according to Mr Motaung. That\nmeans that he was\r\n\tcorrect in saying that when the collision occurred the front of his\r\n\tcab was more or less fully across the left\nhand lane for southbound\r\n\ttraffic.\n8\nThis\r\n\tis a very high estimate for a vehicle of that size moving from rest\r\n\tup a very slight incline and turning at the same time.\nAt 20 kph a\r\n\tvehicle covers slightly more than 5.5 metres per second.\n9\nOn\r\n\this own version he was slowing down from 60 to 70 kph in consequence\r\n\tof his sharp braking. The experts said that he was travelling\nat 58\r\n\tkph or faster when he applied his brakes.",

    "facts": "On 6 April 2008 a collision occurred at the robot‑controlled intersection of Malibongwe Drive and River Road, Randburg. The appellant, James Biddlecombe, was riding a 750 cc Suzuki motorbike northbound when a 12‑ton truck driven by T P Motaung, waiting in the right‑turn lane, pulled into the intersection and turned across the bike's path. The bike struck the truck, burst into flames and Biddlecombe suffered serious burn injuries. The parties agreed on damages of R14 million plus medical costs. The trial court apportioned blame equally between the parties, awarding Biddlecombe half of the damages. The appeal challenges that apportionment. Evidence included eyewitness testimony (including Ms van Eeden), expert reconstructions of speeds and skid marks, and the traffic‑light sequence at the junction.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two principal issues: (1) whether the appellant had discharged the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the truck driver was negligent in turning across on‑coming traffic; and (2) how the court should assess conflicting eyewitness evidence about the state of the traffic lights and the weight to be given to expert versus eyewitness testimony in determining liability and apportionment.",
    "principles": "The Court reiterated the approach from Abdo NO v Senator Insurance, Putzier v Union and South West Africa Insurance, and Stacey v Kent, emphasizing that direct eyewitness evidence generally carries greater weight than expert reconstruction unless the expert evidence is uncontradicted or incontrovertible. The burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to displace the defendant’s version. The Court must consider all evidence holistically, using expert analysis to illuminate physical evidence (skid marks, distances, speeds) but not to automatically override credible eyewitness accounts.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court examined the undisputed physical evidence—photographs of the crash site, a 34.1 m skid mark, and measurements of the truck’s position—and the expert calculations of speed and stopping distances. It concluded that the truck driver was negligent for turning across the bike’s lane when it was not safe, regardless of the traffic‑light colour. However, the Court also found that Biddlecombe was negligent for failing to stop despite clear visibility of the truck’s movement, possibly due to excessive speed or delayed observation. The conflicting testimony on the traffic lights was deemed immaterial to liability, and the equal apportionment of fault was judged appropriate.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The trial court’s decision to apportion liability equally between the appellant and the Road Accident Fund was affirmed."
