The matter is referred\r\nback to the court a quo to continue the trial.\n__________\n_______________________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\n_____________________________________________________________________\nHEHER JA (BOSIELO AND\r\nWALLIS JJA concurring):\n[1] This is an appeal\r\nwith leave of the trial judge (Kgomo JP) against orders made by him\r\nafter the close of the plaintiff’s\ncase in which he dismissed\r\nwith costs an application by the plaintiff (‘Ruslyn’) to\r\namend its trial particulars and\ngranted absolution from the instance\r\nwith costs in respect of its Claim B.\n[2] The respondent\r\n(‘Alexkor’) is a state-controlled entity that carries out\r\nand oversees the mining of diamonds on\nland and at sea in the area of\r\nAlexander Bay in the Northern Cape. From May 2001 until June 2003\r\nRuslyn screened gravel and diamondiferous\noverburden from dumps at\r\nvarious sites under a series of contracts concluded with Alexkor at a\r\nrate per ton of material fed into\nthe screens. In November 2002 the\r\nlatter decided to put out to tender the same activities on a number\r\nof alternative contractual\noptions, one of which was a\r\nrevenue-sharing scheme.\n[3] Ruslyn was the\r\nsuccessful tenderer and on 20 June 2003 concluded an infield\r\nscreening contract with Alexkor on the basis of\na 71.2:28.8 split of\r\nnet revenue in favour of the former. From its point of view, the\r\nprofitability of the undertaking depended\nin the main on its ability\r\nto recover diamonds from the dumps in sufficient quantity and quality\r\n(by caratage) to cover its costs\nof screening, loading, crushing and\r\ntransporting diamondiferous sand and gravel sediments from the mining\r\nareas, and, in addition,\nleave it with a realistic surplus from its\r\nprofit share.\n[4] The venture was not a\r\nsuccess. Ruslyn very soon concluded that it could not turn a profit\r\nfrom the contents of the dumps. About\nJanuary 2004 it abandoned the\r\nattempt but was apparently prevented for some months from removing\r\nits earthmoving equipment and\nscreens by Alexkor’s\r\nintervention.\n[5] In August 2004 Ruslyn\r\nissued summons against Alexkor. Of its original three claims, the\r\nfirst (Claim A) was abandoned before\nthe trial commenced and the\r\nthird (Claim C, for damages based on loss of rental income in respect\r\nof the impounded equipment and\nscreens) remains unresolved. This\r\nappeal concerns only Claim B in which Ruslyn claimed payment of R15\r\n693 969.74 as damages arising\nfrom various alleged fraudulent or\r\nnegligent misrepresentations said to have been made by Alexkor and to\r\nhave induced Ruslyn to\nenter into the infield screening contract.\n[6] As Kgomo JP, in\r\ndelivering judgment on the application for absolution, found that the\r\nappellant had ‘failed by a long\nway to present evidence on each\r\nessential allegation necessary to establish Claim B’ and had\r\nnot made out a prima facie case,\nit will be necessary to revisit both\r\nthe substance of the claim and the evidence led in support of it.\r\nBefore that, however, it\nis appropriate to dispose of the appeal in\r\nrelation to the refusal of the amendment of Ruslyn’s\r\nparticulars for trial.\nThe further\r\nparticulars for trial\n[7] The material\r\nallegations of misrepresentation relied on by the plaintiff included\r\nboth positive misrepresentations about the\nyields from the dumps and\r\nmisrepresentations by non-disclosure of information in Alexkor’s\r\npossession that Ruslyn said it\nowed a duty to disclose. In its\r\nparticulars of claim these were stated as follows:\n’\n18.\r\nDuring the negotiations which preceded the conclusion of the profit\r\nsharing agreement:\n18.1\r\nDefendant was aware of the following material facts and circumstances\r\nof which plaintiff was, to Defendant’s knowledge,\nunaware:\n18.1.1.\r\nDefendant had suffered severe losses pursuant to the agreements\r\nannexed as “A” and “B” hereto, in\nthat the\r\nnet revenue from diamonds recovered from the diamond gravel screened\r\nby Plaintiff in terms of the aforegoing agreements\nhad been\r\nexceedingly insufficient to cover the amount of Plaintiff’s\r\nremuneration in terms of the agreements annexed hereto\nas “A”\r\nand “B”.\n18.1.2.\r\nDefendant had knowledge, due to its historic mining activities:\na)\r\nWhat the net revenue from the diamond yields of the dumps to be mined\r\nby Plaintiff in terms of the profit sharing agreement had\nbeen, and\r\nwhat it was likely to be in future per ton of material from the\r\ndumps;\nb)\r\nWhat grade, and how many carats of diamonds, had been recovered from\r\neach of its dumps in the past, and what the yield of such\ndumps were\r\nlikely to be in future;\nc)\r\nThat it was not possible for Plaintiff to conduct the operations\r\ncalled for by the profit sharing agreement profitably;\nd)\r\nThat the written proposal (annexed hereto marked “D”)\r\nfurnished by Plaintiff to Defendant during the negotiations\n\ncontaining a suggested feasibility of the contract for both parties\r\nwas exceedingly inaccurate, particularly as it related to the\ncarats\r\nof diamonds that could reasonably be expected to be recovered per ton\r\nof screened material from the dumps;\ne)\r\nThat the net effect of the profit sharing agreement would be that\r\nPlaintiff would in effect be bearing the cost of Defendant’s\n\nduty to rehabilitate its mining areas.\n18.2\r\nDefendant had a duty to disclose the aforegoing facts and\r\ncircumstances to Plaintiff during the course of the aforegoing\r\nnegotiations,\nbut intentionally, alternatively negligently, failed to\r\ndo so.\n18.3\r\nDefendant further represented to Plaintiff that:\n18.3.1.\r\nDefendant had achieved on average a recovery of 950 carats of\r\ndiamonds per month at its Noordsif facility from diamond gravel\n\nrecovered by Plaintiff from Defendant’s dumps;\n18.3.2.\r\nThat, in the event that Plaintiff concludes the profit sharing\r\nagreement, it could reasonably expect a recovery of diamonds\nat a\r\nsimilar rate, and that the profit sharing agreement would be\r\nprofitable to Plaintiff; and\n18.3.3.\r\nThat Plaintiff could expect to recover, during the subsistence of the\r\nprofit sharing agreement, the number of carats and\nscreened grade per\r\nmining area set out in the proposal (annexure “D” hereto)\r\nin the rows indicated as “Exp. Screened\ngrade (cphm\n3\n)”\r\nand “Expected carats”.\n18.4\r\nThe aforesaid representations were to the knowledge of the Defendant\r\nfalse, alternatively the Defendant should have known that\nthe\r\nrepresentations were false, in that:\n18.4.1.\r\nDefendant never recovered 950 carats from its Noordsif facility per\r\nmonth from gravel mined by Plaintiff;\n18.4.2.\r\nThe possible yields of the Defendant’s dumps did not allow a\r\nrecovery of diamonds in the ratio referred to in paragraph\n18.3.1\r\nhereinabove;\n18.4.3.\r\nThe number of carats and screened grade of diamonds recoverable per\r\nton of screened material which Defendant had represented\nwere not\r\nachievable.\n19.\r\nThe aforesaid misrepresentations were material and were made by\r\nDefendant to induce and entice Plaintiff into concluding the\nprofit\r\nsharing agreement with Defendant.\n20.\r\nRelying upon the truth of the aforegoing misrepresentations Plaintiff\r\nentered into the profit sharing agreement.\n21.\r\nHad Plaintiff been aware that the representations were false\r\nPlaintiff would not have concluded the profit sharing agreement.’\n[8] Alexkor filed a\r\nlengthy request for further particulars in December 2006. Although\r\nthis was said to be in relation to the amended\nparticulars of claim,\r\nit is apparent that it was intended as a request in terms of uniform\r\nrule 20 and it was answered on that\nbasis by Ruslyn in April 2007.\r\nThe aim of the request was largely to obtain information about the\r\ndates when the positive misrepresentations\nwere made and the persons\r\nby and to whom they were made. The reply identified a date prior to\r\n13 May 2003 and identified Messrs\nOosthuizen, Meyer and Zihlangu as\r\nthe representors and Messrs J I van Loggerenberg, Buthelezi, Opperman\r\nand Truter as the representees.\n[9] Despite the\r\nreferences to a number of potential witnesses in its particulars for\r\ntrial, Ruslyn called only one witness to testify\nas to the events\r\nsurrounding the conclusion of the revenue sharing agreement and the\r\nalleged misrepresentations. He was Mr Eustace\nButhelezi who joined\r\nthe company in 2003 shortly before the conclusion of agreement. Mr\r\nTruter, referred to in the particulars,\nthe general manager for\r\nRuslyn’s operations in Alexander Bay in the first half of 2003,\r\nhad apparently been fired in unpleasant\ncircumstances during June of\r\nthat year. He was, unsurprisingly, not exposed to the rigours of\r\ntestifying despite the important\nrole played by him in preparing and\r\npresenting the tender to Alexkor.\n[10] Mr Buthelezi\r\ntestified that he had made it clear to Mr Truter that he needed him\r\nto get information from Alexkor for the purpose\nof preparing Ruslyn’s\r\nresponse to the invitation to tender. On 9 April 2003 he received a\r\nletter from Mr Truter in the following\nterms:\n‘\nSUBJECT:\r\nALEXKOR SCREENING\nNoordsif\n1\nat this stage +127% above target\r\n(169 carats above month to date).\nTheir\r\nbudget for April 2003 is 964 carats. They already achieved 779.\nPlease\r\nsee the attached schedule.’\n[11] On 22 April 2003,\r\nAlexkor, having received the tender, invited Ruslyn (as well as a\r\ncompeting tenderer) to do a powerpoint\npresentation on its essential\r\nproposals at Alexander Bay on 13 May. A written outline of that\r\npresentation was included in the\nexhibits at the trial. The second\r\npage of the document read as follows:\n‘\nPast\r\nPerformance\nThe\r\nAverage Tons of R.O.M.\n2\nfor the past 5 months were 231\r\n000 tons per month.\nYear\r\nto date diamonds recovered: 9 324 ct’s.\n99.7%\r\nof budget.\nInformation\nThe\r\ncapacity of Noordsif Plant at present is 20 000m\n3\nper month of screened product.\nThe\r\ndumps in the Noordsif Area normally screen out at 10-15% of the Run\r\nof Mine.\nTherefore\r\nthe Headfeed to the various screening plants need to be 200 000m\n3\n(360 000 tons) using a screen\r\nfactor of 10%.\nAt\r\nan average grade of 6ct/100m\n3\nof screening product will result\r\nin a carat production of 1200 carats per month.\nThe\r\naverage stone size of Noordsif Area is 0.90.’\nAccording to Mr\r\nButhelezi’s testimony the reference to the recovery of 9 324\r\ncarats in the year to date must have come from\ninformation obtained\r\nfrom Alexkor. As he put it, such information was ‘very\r\nrelevant’ because ‘we had to evaluate\nthe different\r\nscenarios and without the production numbers coming through from\r\nAlexkor we would have actually have been in the\ndark’. As he\r\nunderstood it, the production number stated in the document was the\r\ntotal of the tons screened by Ruslyn. Alexkor\nwas represented at the\r\npresentation, according to Mr Buthelezi’s recollection by its\r\nCEO, Mr Zihlangu, Mr Johan Oosthuizen,\nits production manager, and Mr\r\nWillie Meyer, its mine manager. The production and yield numbers in\r\nthe powerpoint presentation\nwere not queried by the representatives\r\nof Alexkor.\n[12] On 14 May 2003\r\nAlexkor notified Ruslyn that, subject to the consent of its board of\r\ndirectors, it was prepared to enter into\na contract on terms and\r\nconditions to be agreed.\n[13] After the suspension\r\nof Mr Truter in early June, the CEO of Ruslyn, Mr Rusty van\r\nLoggerenberg instructed Mr Buthelezi to confirm\nthat the reports\r\napparently received from Alexkor through Mr Truter concerning carat\r\nproduction were ‘authentic’. As\na result Mr Buthelezi and\r\nMr Eugene van Loggerenberg met with Mr Johan Oosthuizen, whom Mr\r\nButhelezi described as ‘the production\nmanager at the time for\r\nthe Noordsif plant’ seeking ‘some sort of comfort’.\r\nAs to this meeting Mr Buthelezi testified\nas follows:\n‘\nSo\r\nactually I think that must have been – I cannot quite remember\r\nthe days but very close to the signing, I think actually\nthe same day\r\nwhen we actually signed, we spoke to him at length about the\r\nproduction and everything and he said to us you know\nyou guys you are\r\nactually very slow, you should have signed this thing a long time ago\r\nand he pulled out a production report which\nactually showed us that,\r\nI think it must have been in the second or third week of production\r\nand already think the figures were\nrunning at round about 700 and\r\nsomething. So to which we said but what do you actually expect\r\nnormally you know, from this dumps\nyou know on average, and he gave\r\nus a number of 950 carats as an average. After that we obviously had\r\nto report back. I must be\nquite honest. I mean I think we actually\r\nquite comfortable with that kind of information coming straight from\r\na production manager\nof Alexkor. So we called the CEO Mr Rusty van\r\nLoggerenberg and told him about this. I think he was also excited\r\nabout that. So\nwe said look we believe that we need to sign this\r\nthing, because Alexkor as well, they want to have this matter\r\nconcluded so that\nthey can actually carry on with their work. So he\r\nactually sent us a letter of authority you know, giving both Mr\r\nEugene van Loggerenberg\nand myself authority to sign the contract on\r\nbehalf of the company. . . But obviously he [Oosthuizen] knew that we\r\nare actually\nasking that information with the view of actually making\r\na decision on whether to enter into a profit sharing agreement or\r\nnot.\n. . No, it definitely did persuade us to get into that profit\r\nshare agreement.’\n[14] Despite the fact\r\nthat Mr Buthelezi’s evidence relating to the meeting with Mr\r\nOosthuizen and its inducing effect on the\nconclusion of the contract\r\nhad not been foreshadowed in Ruslyn’s particulars for trial, no\r\nobjection was taken to the leading\nof such evidence then or\r\nthereafter at the trial. That such a meeting had taken place was not\r\ndisputed and in fact Mr Buthelezi\nwas extensively cross-examined with\r\nthe object of demonstrating that the figures supplied by Mr\r\nOosthuizen had been correct, the\njustification for the exercise being\r\nexpressed by counsel for Alexkor as follows:\n‘\nSeeing\r\nthat it is an essential issue of the case as to whether Mr John\r\nOosthuizen gave correct information, it is going to be necessary\nto\r\nexamine whether if that was the request to Mr Oosthuizen, whether in\r\nfact the answer he [Buthelezi] received was correct.’\n[15] After Mr Buthelezi\r\ncompleted his testimony Ruslyn called two expert witnesses before\r\nclosing its case. Counsel for Alexkor\napplied for absolution from the\r\ninstance. According to the judgment what occurred thereafter was as\r\nfollows:\n‘\nAfter\r\nMr Gess, for Alexkor, had completed his absolution address and when\r\nMr Beyers, for Ruslyn, was at the tail-end of his argument\nin\r\nopposition of the absolution Mr Beyers intimated that he was unable\r\nto complete his argument before seeking certain amendments\nto sustain\r\nhis argument. As the proposed amendments were substantial and were\r\nnot going to go through unopposed, the case was postponed\nfor this\r\nreason for a substantive application.’\n[16] A\r\nsubstantive application was indeed brought and refused by the court a\r\nquo. The appellant sought to amend its answers to the\nrequests that I\r\nhave specified above. It is unnecessary to set out the details of the\r\nchanges. Suffice it to say that the only\nproposed amendments of\r\nsubstance are those which seek to place the misrepresentations relied\r\non in paras 18.3.1 and 18.3.2 at a\ntime\nafter\n,\r\ninstead of\nbefore\nthe\r\ndrafting of the mine plan, Annexure “D” to the\r\nparticulars of claim, and confining its contentions by saying that\nMr\r\nOosthuizen and no one else was the representor on each occasion. This\r\nwas, as I have earlier noted, consistent with the substance\nof the\r\nevidence which had been led by Ruslyn without objection.\n[17] The learned judge\r\npresident refused the application to amend because:\n(1) he regarded the\r\nexplanation for the failure to become aware of the fact and\r\nsignificance of the new evidence as unacceptable\nand, perhaps,\r\nunworthy of credence;\n(2) he censured the delay\r\nin applying for the amendment until November 2009, after the close of\r\nthe plaintiff’s case, pointing\nout that notice could have been\r\ngiven at the second pre-trial conference held on 4 February 2009;\n(3) he was of the view\r\nthat the grant of the amendment would have the effect of enabling the\r\nplaintiff to present a fresh case at\na late stage, a case that the\r\ndefendant had not come to court to meet;\n(4) he found\r\nthat allowing the amendment would conflict with established\r\nprinciple, referring particularly to dicta in\nGreyling\r\nv Nieuwoudt\n1951 (1) SA 88\n(O) at 91H,\nZarug\r\nv Parvathie NO\n1962 (3) SA 872\n(D) at 876C-E\r\nand\nTrans-Drakensberg Bank Ltd (under judicial\r\nmanagement) v Combined Engineering (Pty) Ltd and Another\n1967 (3) SA 637\n(D) at 640H.\n[18] To deal first with\r\nthe principle, the cases cited by the learned judge all deal with\r\napplications to amend pleadings. Further\nparticulars for trial are\r\nnot pleadings. The opportunity to request them arises after the close\r\nof pleadings: uniform rule 21(2).\nThey are limited to obtaining\r\ninformation that is strictly necessary to prepare for trial. They do\r\nnot set up a cause of action\nor defence by which a party is, in the\r\nabsence of amendment or tacit concurrence, bound and by which the\r\nlimits of his evidence\nare circumscribed. Nor can they change an\r\nexisting cause of action or create a new one (as the trial judge\r\nappears to have believed).\nThe purpose of particulars for trial is to\r\nlimit waste of time and costs by providing the other party with\r\nadditional insight into\nthe case which has been pleaded, thus\r\navoiding, where possible, delays or postponements to seek evidence to\r\nmeet a case. See for\nexample,\nThompson v Barclays Bank DCO\n1965\r\n(1) SA 365\n(W) at 369D-E. Such particulars are only required if and\r\nwhen the other party asks for them and what will be furnished is to a\r\nlarge extent dependent on the skill and foresight adopted in the\r\nformulation of the request. Because they are not pleadings, they\ndo\r\nnot limit the scope of the case being made by the party that supplies\r\nthem. A party has a right to rely on all and any evidence\nthat is\r\nadmissible and relevant to his pleaded cause or defence and, save\r\nwithin the parameters set by the purpose of such particulars\nin so\r\nfar as ensuring a fair trial is concerned, no stultification of that\r\nright should be permitted. Thus, unless there is clear\nevidence of\r\nbad faith in the furnishing of the original further particulars or in\r\nthe withholding of the intention to change the\nthrust of the evidence\r\nor irremediable prejudice to the other party caused by reliance on\r\nincorrect or insufficient particulars\nfurnished by his opponent,\r\nrelevant evidence which goes beyond the terms of particulars for\r\ntrial should be admitted subject to\na postponement, if necessary and\r\nan appropriate award of costs to cure the element of surprise.\n[19] Applications to\r\namend particulars for trial seem to me to be largely inappropriate\r\nand unnecessary, particularly once the trial\nhas got under way. It\r\nshould be sufficient for counsel to notify his opponent at an early\r\nstage when he becomes aware that his\nevidence may depart materially\r\nfrom the information in the particulars for trial. The latter can\r\nthen take the matter up with the\ntrial court if necessary. In\r\nappropriate circumstances (where the contemplated evidence involves\r\ngreat complexity, for example)\nthe court may consider it fair to\r\norder the party proposing to lead such evidence to reduce particulars\r\nof the changes to writing\nbut that is not a rule.\n[20] The present case is\r\nan example in point. Counsel for Ruslyn should have drawn attention\r\nto his proposed departure from the\nparticulars on record before he\r\nled evidence having that effect. However at an early stage of the\r\ntrial (11 February 2009) when\nthe evidence of Buthelezi exceeded the\r\nbounds of those particulars, counsel for Alexkor remained\r\nunprotesting, this despite the\ninference to be drawn from his\r\ncross-examination that he appreciated the importance of the evidence.\r\nThereafter he had ample time\nto consider his client’s position\r\nand prepare his case to meet the varied thrust of the evidence. It\r\nseems to me that by\nthe time that the plaintiff closed its case the\r\nhorse had long bolted and an application to amend had become\r\nsuperfluous. The learned\njudge could either have refused to grant an\r\namendment\nfor that reason\nor declined to make an order to that\r\nend.\n[21] The application\r\nbeing unnecessary, the wasted costs generated by it should have been\r\nheld to the account of Ruslyn. These however\nshould not include\r\nAlexkor’s costs of opposition, as it had precipitated the\r\napplication by its contention that Ruslyn’s\ncase was restricted\r\nby the trial particulars and this was aggravated by its determined\r\nresistance to the amendment, which not only\nserved no purpose in the\r\ncircumstances but was predicated upon principles that related to\r\namendment of pleadings.\nThe application for\r\nabsolution from the instance.\n[22] The test is clear:\r\nthe plaintiff must make out a prima facie case in the sense that\r\nthere is evidence relating to all the elements\nof a claim on the\r\nstrength of which the court could or might find for the plaintiff at\r\nthe end of the case. See\nGordon Lloyd Page & Associates v\r\nRivera\n2001 (1) SA 88\n(SCA) at 92E-93A. The plaintiff is at this\r\nstage entitled to rely on any reasonable inference drawn from its\r\nevidence (ibid at\n92 H).\n[23] It was sufficient to\r\ndefeat the application that one basis relied on by the plaintiff in\r\nsupport of claim B might succeed at\nthe end of the case. In\r\nrevisiting the sufficiency of the evidence my failure to deal with\r\nany allegation either in the form of\na positive misrepresentation or\r\nan omission coupled with a duty to disclose should not be regarded as\r\nan expression of opinion\nfor or against the plaintiff’s case in\r\nthat respect. Nor should anything in this judgment be taken as\r\nindicating that the\nclaim should succeed. It is confined to the\r\nquestion whether there is evidence upon which the trial court might\r\nfind for the plaintiff\non its pleaded case, whether based on\r\nmisrepresentations by omission or of a positive nature. In my view\r\nthere was such evidence\nand the application for absolution should\r\nhave been refused.\n[24] In relation to the\r\ncase depending upon omissions to disclose on the part of Alexkor the\r\nlearned judge was of the opinion that\na tenderer who failed\r\nadequately to acquaint itself with the information required to\r\nprepare its tender created its own risk of\nfailure. He adopted the\r\nprinciple stated in\nFelton Skead & Grant v Port Elizabeth\r\nMunicipality\n1964 (4) SA 422\n(E) at 425E-G:\n‘\nIt\r\nseems to follow that it is for the tenderer to satisfy himself as to\r\nthe nature and extent of the work to be done regardless\nof the cost\r\nand inconvenience involved in thus satisfying himself.\nIt\r\ntherefore affords the applicants in this case no argument to say that\r\nfor them to have had to make an independent and exhaustive\n\ninvestigation into the extent of the work involved for the purposes\r\nof submitting a tender would have entailed considerable time,\nexpense\r\nand effort. The question is whether they were in this case entitled\r\nto rely on the information supplied by the respondent\nfor the purpose\r\nof tender without independent enquiry so as to satisfy themselves as\r\nto the nature and extent of the work involved.\nOn the authorities\r\nwhich I have mentioned I hold that they were not. But even if they\r\nwere their attention was expressly drawn\nto the distinction between\r\n“assessments” on the one hand and “properties”\r\non the other, and the agreement\nexpressly provides that:\n“\nThe\r\ntenderer, by tendering, shall be deemed to have satisfied himself as\r\nto all the conditions and circumstances affecting the tender.”’\nBut that was a very\r\ndifferent case from the present. The applicant had tendered to\r\nprepare a property valuation record of all properties\nin the\r\nmunicipality for a fixed price. In the application it sought a\r\ndeclarator that it was entitled to additional remuneration.\nIt did\r\nnot rely on negligent misrepresentation, but on a\nquantum meruit\n(at 424H-425A):\n‘\nThe\r\ngravamen of their complaint . . . was that information for the\r\npurposes of tender was inadequate in that it failed to disclose\nand\r\nfailed to warn that in most wards there were large numbers of vacant\r\nsites in privately owned proclaimed townships to which\nmunicipal\r\nservices had not been extended which were lumped together as single\r\nunits under the item vacant sites. . . The submission\nthen was as I\r\nunderstood it, that these large numbers of vacant sites to which\r\nmunicipal services had not been extended were therefore\nnot included\r\nin the contract for which a property valuation record had to be\r\ncompiled and that because the respondent insisted\nthat they were to\r\nbe included the applicants are entitled to additional remuneration\r\nbased on a\nquantum\r\nmeruit\n.’\nThe\r\nclaim of the present appellant was based on misrepresentation. The\r\nlaw in this regard has long been established:\nSampson\r\nv Union and Rhodesia Wholesale Ltd\n(\nin\r\nliquidation\n)\n1929 AD 468\nat\r\n479-80, (quoting first Jessel MR in\nRedgrave\r\nv Hurd\n1881, 20 Ch D 1\nat\r\n13):\n‘‘‘\nIf\r\na man is induced to enter into a contract by a false representation\r\nit is not sufficient answer to him to say ‘if you had\nused due\r\ndiligence you would have found out that the statement was untrue’.”\r\nIt makes no difference according to our\nlaw whether the person who\r\ninduced the contract knew at the time when he made the representation\r\nthat it was false. The defendant\nis entitled to succeed if he can\r\nestablish that the representation of the plaintiff was a material one\r\nand that he entered into\nthe contract on the faith of such\r\nrepresentation –\nViljoen\r\nv Hillier\n(1904\r\nTS 312).\n’\n[25] Alexkor invited\r\nRuslyn to submit a tender on inter alia the basis of a\r\n‘revenue-split’ agreement and the contract\nwas awarded on\r\nthat basis. (There is some indication in the evidence that a ‘revenue\r\nsplit’ was the only form of agreement\nthat Alexkor was\r\ninterested in despite the invitation to tender on a fixed price per\r\nton basis.) Prima facie such a proposed arrangement\nis capable of\r\nbeing construed as a holding out to the tenderer that the invitor\r\ncontemplates the making of a profit which will\nbe shared between the\r\ncontracting parties. Indeed it was referred to in the evidence as a\r\n‘profit-sharing agreement’.\nHowever the evidence adduced\r\nby Ruslyn in the form of official reports of Alexkor and from expert\r\nanalysis of its historical records\ntended to show that the latter had\r\nno reasonable grounds for representing the proposed ‘revenue-split’\r\narrangement\nas one likely to turn (or perhaps even capable of\r\nproducing) a profit for the parties and, particularly, the appellant.\r\nThat this\nwas so is derived from reasonable inferences drawn from\r\nevidence to the effect that:\n1) during the two ‘rate\r\nper ton’ contracts between the parties Alexkor had either\r\nfailed to make a profit or such profit\nas it had made was not such as\r\nto render the continuation of those arrangements acceptable to it;\n2) the number and grade\r\nof diamonds recovered during those contracts had decreased and was\r\nlikely to continue in that trend;\n3) the reason for\r\ninviting a revenue split tender (and concluding the agreement on that\r\nbasis) was to release the substantial risk\nof the dump clearance\r\noperation from the shoulders of Alexkor and transfer it to the\r\nsuccessful tenderer.\n[26] Alexkor did not\r\ninform Ruslyn of any of these matters. It is a potentially reasonable\r\nconclusion from the evidence that\n1) knowledge of such\r\nmatters was peculiarly within the knowledge of Alexkor;\n2) the appellant did not\r\nhave access to information necessary to make an informed decision as\r\nto the content and viability of a\nproposed tender on a revenue split\r\nbasis without the co-operation of the respondent; Mr Fourie testified\r\nas follows:\n‘\nMy\r\nLord, the only way a contractor could actually assess the\r\neffectiveness of the selective mining would be on a very regular\r\nbasis\nto receive feedback as to how many diamonds were recovered\r\nduring this so-called selective mining process. If one were to carry\n\non and not receive this feedback regularly, one will actually never\r\nknow how successful you are.\n.\r\n. . as a result determination of the potential profitability of a\r\nscreening operation in respect of dumps would almost exclusively\nrely\r\nupon past data in terms of carats yielded per 100 cubic metres\r\nscreened and of course also the volume of material so screened.\n\nWithout knowing how many diamonds you get when you screen the head\r\nfeed, it is impossible to determine whether this will be a profitable\n\noperation or not.\n.\r\n. .\nAnd\r\na prospective tenderer in respect of a screening operation similar to\r\nthe profit sharing agreement that we are talking about,\nwith this\r\nusually being entirely dependent on the mine owner in respect of such\r\ninformation, without which of course the tenderer\nwould not be able\r\nto determine the profitability of the profit sharing agreement unless\r\nit would allow, as I said earlier on, to\ndetermine on its own what\r\nwould be the profitability of such a venture by doing some\r\nexploration or sampling upfront.’\n3) that some attempt was\r\nmade by Ruslyn to garner relevant information but what was furnished\r\nonly tended towards showing the attractiveness\nor potential\r\nprofitability of the venture as for example Exh 166B (the schedule\r\nattached to Mr Truter’s letter of 9 April\n2003, referred to in\r\npara 10 above) and Mr Oosthuizen’s response to Mr Buthelezi’s\r\nenquiry.\n[27] Further, a\r\nreasonable inference may possibly be drawn from the matters referred\r\nto in the preceding paragraph that the non-disclosure\nconstituted a\r\nmaterial misrepresentation and if the correct information had been\r\ndisclosed it would have provided reason for Ruslyn\nnot to tender on a\r\nrevenue-split basis or not to conclude the contract in June 2003. In\r\nmy view the evidence at the end of the\nplaintiff’s case was\r\nsuch as to render the remarks of Hoexter JA in\nHulett and Others v\r\nHulett\n[1992] ZASCA 111\n;\n1992 (4) SA 291\n(A) at 310H-311C\nmutatis mutandis\npotentially applicable (bearing in mind, of course, that even\r\nprima facie proof of reliance on an innocent representation was\r\nsufficient\nfor the appellant to surmount absolution).\n‘\nIn\r\nthe present case a material representation was made which was\r\ncalculated to induce the appellants to enter into the contract.\nThere\r\nis evidence, which appears to be entirely credible, that the\r\nappellants were so induced. It seems to me that in these\r\ncircumstances\nthere arises a fair inference that this is in fact what\r\nhappened. Mr\nGordon\nwho,\r\nwith Mr\nHewitt\n,\r\nappeared for the appellants, called our attention to one of the\r\njudgments delivered by the High Court of Australia in s\nGould\r\nand Another v Vaggelas and Others\n[1985]\r\nLRC (Comm) 497.\nThe following remarks in the judgment of Wilson J (at\r\n517\nd-f\n)\r\nappear to me to indicate the proper approach to the situation here\r\nunder consideration:\n“\nWhere\r\na plaintiff shows that a defendant has made false statements to him\r\nintending thereby to induce him to enter into a contract\nand those\r\nstatements are of such a nature as would be likely to provide such\r\ninducement and the plaintiff did in fact enter into\nthat contract and\r\nthereby suffered damage and nothing more appears, common sense would\r\ndemand the conclusion that the false representations\nplayed at least\r\nsome part in inducing the plaintiff to enter into the contract.\r\nHowever, it is open to the defendant to obstruct\nthe drawing of that\r\nnatural inference of fact by showing that there were other relevant\r\ncircumstances. Examples commonly given\nof such circumstances are that\r\nthe plaintiff not only actually knew the true facts but knew them to\r\nbe the truth or that the plaintiff\neither by his words or conduct\r\ndisavowed any reliance on the fraudulent representations.”\nHere\r\nthe defendant elected to adduce no rebutting evidence and, in my\r\nview, there is nothing before us which tends to displace the\nnatural\r\ndeduction that the appellants in fact relied upon the fraudulent\r\nmisrepresentation, as JH and Townsend said that they had\ndone.’\n[28] In the circumstances\r\nthe general principles enunciated by Van Zyl J in\nMcCann v Goodall\r\nGroup Operations (Pty) Ltd\n1995 (2) SA 718\n(C) at 722F-725G and\r\nby Conradie JA in\nAbsa Bank Ltd v Fouche\n2003 (1) SA 176\n(SCA)\r\nat paras 4, 5 and 9, relating to the establishing of a legal duty to\r\nact positively to prevent a loss, could properly be\nregarded as\r\nrelevant to the final decision of the plaintiff’s claim, and\r\nthe failure of Alexkor to make disclosure sufficient\nto enable Ruslyn\r\nto reach an informed decision about whether it should enter into the\r\nnew contract with Alexkor might fairly be\nregarded as an actionable\r\nnon-disclosure.\n[29] The learned judge\r\nalso concluded that the appellant had not made a case on the ground\r\nof the alleged positive representations.\nIn what follows I shall\r\nconsider his reasons for so finding.\n[30] The court\r\ninterpreted counsel’s attitude to any refusal of the proposed\r\namendment as ‘an ineluctable but unexpressed\ncapitulation on\r\nthe part of the plaintiff that absent the amendment its case is as\r\ngood as dead in the water’. That led him,\nI think, to a failure\r\nto give full weight to all the evidence presented to him.\n[31] The court considered\r\nthat the failure or inability of appellant to call witnesses such as\r\nMessrs Truter, Taljaard and Mr Rusty\nvan Loggerenberg left unbridged\r\ngaps in the proof of even a prima facie case. I do not agree. The\r\nevidence of Mr Buthelezi taken\nat face value provided proof that the\r\nmine plan that accompanied and supported the tender was produced by\r\nMr Truter with input\nfrom Mr Taljaard. The plan was a detailed\r\nprojection on a dump by dump basis of what Ruslyn expected to recover\r\nduring the duration\nof the contract. While Truter may have possessed\r\ncertain inside knowledge derived from his recent employment at\r\nAlexkor, Mr Fourie\ntestified that it was unlikely that he could have\r\nretained the breadth of detail necessary to prepare the plan. It is\r\nat least\na reasonable inference that he had resort to and obtained\r\nfrom Alexkor information in relation to such matters as the caratage\r\nand yield of diamonds from the respective dumps. It is reasonably\r\nclear that the projected figures for diamond recovery far exceed\n\neither Alexkor’s historic records for Ruslyn’s operations\r\nor its expectations for the future. If information furnished\nby\r\nAlexkor did provide the basis of the mine plan that information was\r\neither misinterpreted by Mr Taljaard and Mr Truter or must\nhave been\r\nseverely misleading. At this stage it is sufficient that the second\r\nis a reasonable possibility.\n[32] There is some\r\nmeasure of support both for the derivation of the figures from\r\nAlexkor and the proper interpretation of such\nfigures. First there\r\nare Exhs 166A and 166B. The latter seems to have the stamp of\r\nauthority as a document emanating from Alexkor.\nThe former is Mr\r\nTruter’s summary of that document (quoted in para 10 above).\r\nThe information seems to bear out a caratage\nof about 950 for the\r\nmonth of April 2003 (after leaving diamonds perhaps attributable to\r\nEquilibrium and Gully Diamonds out of\naccount). Second there is Mr\r\nButhelezi’s evidence of the meeting with Mr Oosthuizen, who,\r\nhaving been informed that the purpose\nwas to enable appellant to\r\ndecide whether to enter into the revenue split agreement with Alexkor\r\nexpressed surprise that appellant\nhad taken so long in deciding to do\r\nso and confirmed that the yield of diamonds from appellant’s\r\noperation during the most\nrecent mining period had been in the region\r\nof 950 carats per month.\n[33] The learned judge\r\nwas of the view that only Ruslyn’s chief executive, as its\r\ndeciding mind, could testify to the reliance\nplaced by it on\r\ninformation obtained from Alexkor; as he was not called a lacuna was\r\nleft in its case. There was, however, direct\nevidence that, after\r\ndoubts arose as to the integrity of Mr Truter early in June, Ruslyn’s\r\nCEO, Mr Rusty van Loggerenberg,\ninstructed Mr Buthelezi to seek\r\nconfirmation from Alexkor that the yield on which Mr Truter had based\r\nhis calculations was ‘authentic’.\nOnly after confirmation\r\nwas obtained from Mr Oosthuizen did Mr Van Loggerenberg direct Mr\r\nButhelezi to conclude the contract. The\nlearned judge found that Mr\r\nVan Loggerenberg had committed the appellant to heavy expenditure on\r\nthe presumed assurance that Alexkor\nwould award it the contract\nbefore\nthe Oosthuizen meeting. The judge inferred from this\r\nthat the die had already been cast in favour of the contract whatever\r\nMr Oosthuizen\nmight say. However an equally tenable and perhaps, at\r\nthe end of the case, more probable, explanation is that the fall-out\r\nwith\nMr Truter persuaded Mr Van Loggerenberg of the need for caution.\r\nThat he wished to be satisfied about the data used by Mr Truter\n\nbefore finally committing the appellant was understandable and\r\nreasonable in the circumstances. As Mr Buthelezi emphasized the\n\nappellant could not have concluded the contract on the prospect of a\r\nsubstantially lower yield such as 575 carats per month. Reliance\non a\r\nrepresentation apparently emanating from Alexkor whether at the time\r\nof preparing the tender or before signature was thus\nproved as a\r\nreasonably possible inference from the evidence.\n[34] There was also\r\nsufficient in the evidence to justify the conclusion that the\r\nrepresentation of an average yield of about 950\ncarats per month had\r\nno foundation in truth. The historical monthly yields for the\r\nprevious two contracts from the appellant’s\noperations were\r\nabout 575 and 429 carats respectively.\n[35] To sum up-\n1. The application to\r\namend the particulars for trial was strictly unnecessary and for that\r\nreason should not have been granted.\nAlexkor provoked and then\r\nopposed the application, but did so on fallacious grounds. In the\r\nappeal, time and paper were wasted\non the same wrangling. In my\r\nopinion it would be fair to order each party to bear its own costs\r\narising from the application at\nthe trial and in the appeal save that\r\nthe appellant should not be entitled to recover the costs of\r\npreparing the record in so far\nas such bears on the application to\r\namend.\n2. The learned judge\r\nshould not have granted absolution at the end of the plaintiff’s\r\ncase. The costs of the argument for\nabsolution in the trial should be\r\npaid by the respondent. As the appellant has achieved success on this\r\nissue in the appeal it\nshould, subject to what I have said earlier in\r\nthis paragraph, have its costs.\n[36] The following order\r\nis made:\n1. The appeal succeeds.\n2. The orders of the\r\ncourt a quo are set aside and replaced with the following:\n‘\n(a) The\r\napplication for amendment of the plaintiff’s trial particulars\r\nis refused. In this regard each party is to pay its\nown wasted costs.\n(b) The application for\r\nabsolution from the instance is refused with costs.’\n3. The costs of the\r\nappeal are to be borne as follows:\n(a) Each party is to bear\r\nits own costs in relation to the application to amend.\n(b) Save as aforesaid the\r\nrespondent is to pay the costs of the appeal not including the\r\npreparation of that part of the record\ncontaining the application for\r\namendment of the trial particulars.\n4. All costs are to\r\ninclude the costs of two counsel where such were employed.\n5. The matter is referred\r\nback to the court a quo to continue the trial.\n____________________\nJ A Heher\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT: J W Jonker\nVan de Wall &\r\nPartners, Kimberley\nHoney & Partners,\r\nBloemfontein\nRESPONDENT: D W Gess\nWebber Wentzel Attorneys,\r\nCape Town\nLovius Block,\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nNoordsif\r\n\twas Alexkor’s diamond recovery plant at which all material\r\n\tsifted by Ruslyn and other contractors was treated.\n2\nRun\r\n\tof the Mine ie the gravel etc after sifting.",

    "facts": "Alexkor, a state‑controlled diamond mining entity, invited tender for the screening of gravel and diamond‑bearing overburden from dumps in the Alexander Bay area. Ruslyn Mining & Plant Hire (Pty) Ltd was awarded the contract after a tender process and entered into a profit‑sharing (revenue‑split) agreement on 20 June 2003, with a 71.2:28.8 split in favour of Ruslyn. The profitability of the venture hinged on the quantity and grade of diamonds recovered. Ruslyn later found that the yields were far lower than represented, abandoned the operation in early 2004, and was prevented from removing its equipment by Alexkor. Ruslyn sued for damages (Claim B) alleging fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations by Alexkor that induced it to enter the contract, and also sought to amend its trial particulars.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised two principal issues: (1) whether the trial court was correct to refuse Ruslyn's application to amend its further particulars for trial; and (2) whether the trial court was correct to grant absolution from the instance, i.e., whether Ruslyn had established a prima facie case of misrepresentation (both positive statements and non‑disclosure of material facts) sufficient to survive the trial.",
    "principles": "The court considered the test for a prima facie case (Gordon Lloyd Page v Rivera) and the established common‑law rules on misrepresentation, including the requirement that a false material statement that induced a contract is actionable regardless of the plaintiff's own due diligence (Sampson v Union; Redgrave v Hurd; Viljoen v Hillier). It distinguished amendment of further particulars from amendment of pleadings, citing Greyling v Nieuwoudt, Zarug v Parvathie, Trans‑Drakensberg Bank and Thompson v Barclays, emphasizing that particulars are for case management, not for limiting the evidential scope. The duty to disclose material facts in negotiations and the relevance of non‑disclosure were drawn from case law such as Felton Skead & Grant v Port Elizabeth Municipality.",
    "application": "The court held that the amendment application was unnecessary and should be refused, because Ruslyn had known of the departure from its particulars early in the trial and Alexkor had not objected. It further found that there was sufficient evidence—particularly the testimony of Mr Buthelezi, the Alexkor yield figures, and the meeting with Mr Oosthuizen—to support a claim that Alexkor made false positive representations and failed to disclose material information. Consequently, the plaintiff had satisfied the prima facie test, and absolution from the instance was improper.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded. The court set aside the lower court's orders, refused Ruslyn's application to amend the trial particulars and refused the absolution from the instance. Costs were allocated as ordered, and the matter was referred back to the trial court for continuation of the trial."
