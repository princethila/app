The second\r\nappellant, Thebemed Medical Scheme (Thebemed)\nand the respondent,\r\nSuremed Health Medical Scheme (Suremed), are medical schemes\r\nregistered in terms of the\nMedical Schemes Act 131 of 1998\n. Thebemed\r\nand Suremed entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 19\r\nApril 2010 in terms of which they agreed in principle\nto merge,\r\nsubject to the approval of their members. They lodged an exposition\r\nof their proposed merger with the Registrar in terms\nof\ns 63\nof the\r\nAct. This appeal revolves around the interpretation of\ns 63\nand in\r\nparticular, whether the Registrar has the power to confirm an\r\nexposition that is not submitted pursuant to an agreement\nto merge.\n[2] The background to\r\nthis matter is the following: Suremed is a small medical scheme with\r\nonly 1576 members. This number falls\nshort of the minimum of 6000\r\nmembers required by\nsections 24(2)(\nd\n)\r\nand 27(1)(\nd\n) of the\r\nAct read with Regulation 2(3) of the Medical Schemes Regulations, GN\r\nR1262, Regulation Gazette 6652, 20 October 1999. The\nRegistrar has,\r\nsince 2007, requested that Suremed address this problem. He\r\neventually threatened that if Suremed did not comply\nwith the\r\nrequirement of a minimum of 6000 members by the end of April 2010, he\r\nwould ‘direct the scheme into an amalgamation’.\nSuremed\r\nidentified Thebemed as a suitable merger partner and as has already\r\nbeen mentioned, they entered into a MOU in terms of\nwhich they agreed\r\nto merge. Clause 1 of the MOU records the following:\n‘\nThebe and Suremed are\r\nregistered medical schemes whose Boards of Trustees have agreed to a\r\nmerger of the two schemes\nsubject\r\nto approval by\n:\nThe respective members of each scheme\nThe Council for Medical Schemes\nThis document seeks to capture the key\r\nprinciples and procedures already agreed to which will form the basis\r\nof a formal agreement\nto be entered into by the parties.’\r\n(Emphasis added.)\n[3] Suremed and Thebemed\r\njointly prepared an ‘exposition’ setting out the proposed\r\namalgamation for submission to the\nRegistrar in terms of s 63(2) of\r\nthe Act. Thebemed and Suremed’s boards approved the exposition\r\non 26 and 28 June 2010, respectively.\nThe exposition was lodged with\r\nthe Registrar on 1 July 2010. The Registrar gave notice on 3 August\r\n2010 that the exposition would\nbe open for public inspection at the\r\noffice of the Registrar and the registered offices of both schemes\r\nfrom 4 August 2010. The\nRegistrar gave interested parties until 14\r\nSeptember 2010 to comment on the exposition. Suremed and Thebemed\r\ncaused similar notices\nto be published in the media on 8 August 2010\r\nand in the Government Gazette on 27 August 2010.\n[4] In accordance with\r\nthe terms of the MOU, the two funds conducted a poll of their\r\nrespective members regarding the merger. Thebemed’s\nmembers\r\nvoted in favour of the merger while the majority of Suremed’s\r\nmembers voted against it. On 22 September 2010, Suremed\nadvised the\r\nRegistrar that its members had not approved the merger and asked the\r\nRegistrar to withdraw the exposition. The Registrar\nnevertheless\r\nconfirmed the exposition on 29 September 2010. Suremed appealed\r\nagainst the Registrar’s decision to the Medical\nSchemes Appeal\r\nBoard, which dismissed the appeal. Suremed took the decisions of the\r\nRegistrar and the Appeal Board on review to\nthe North Gauteng High\r\nCourt, Pretoria (Prinsloo J) which upheld the review and set aside\r\nthe decisions of the Registrar and the\nAppeal Board. This is an\r\nappeal against the judgment of the high court, with the leave of that\r\ncourt.\n[5] The high court held\r\nthat it was not competent for the Registrar to confirm the exposition\r\nbecause the parties’ merger\nagreement was rendered void when\r\nSuremed’s members voted against the merger. The high court\r\nfurther held that the Registrar\ndid not have the power to confirm an\r\nexposition which was not underpinned by a valid and binding\r\nagreement. On appeal, the appellants\ncontended that the purpose of s\r\n63 was to create a mechanism to give statutory force to an exposition\r\n– a mechanism not dependent\nupon an agreement to merge or\r\ntransfer of a business to or from a medical scheme. It was argued\r\nthat the lodging of an exposition\ntriggers a process conducted under\r\nthe control of the Registrar and in terms of the Act. The procedure\r\ninitiated by the submission\nof an exposition, so the argument went,\r\ntakes the process out of the realm of contract between the parties\r\nand locates it in the\nstatutory and regulatory arena, and the\r\nRegistrar must consider whether the proposed amalgamation or transfer\r\nof business meets\nthe requirements of the section. On the\r\ninterpretation of s 63 contended for by the appellants, the Registrar\r\ndoes have the power\nto confirm an exposition even if it is not\r\nunderpinned by a binding agreement to merge. According to this\r\ninterpretation, the exposition\nbecomes binding on the parties\r\nindependently of any underlying agreement and immediately after\r\nconfirmation by the Registrar.\n[6] The determination of\r\nthe issue in this matter lies in the interpretation of s 63. This\r\nsection provides the statutory framework\nfor amalgamations and\r\ntransfer of businesses to or from medical schemes and gives the\r\nRegistrar regulatory powers in respect of\nsuch transactions. In terms\r\nof s 63(1) such transactions shall not be of any force and effect\r\nunless carried out in accordance\nwith the provisions of s 63. Section\r\n63(1) provides that:\n‘\nNo transaction\ninvolving\r\nthe amalgamation of the business of a medical scheme with any\r\nbusiness of any other person (irrespective of whether that\nother\r\nperson is or is not a medical scheme) or the transfer of any business\r\nfrom a medical scheme to any other medical scheme or\nthe transfer of\r\nany business from any other person to a medical scheme, shall be of\r\nany force, unless such amalgamation or transfer\nis carried out in\r\naccordance with the provisions of this section\n.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[7] In terms of s 63(2)\r\nthe medical schemes concerned are required to submit ‘a copy of\r\nthe exposition of the proposed transaction’\nto the Registrar.\r\nThe meaning of the words ‘exposition’ and ‘transaction’\r\nhave not been defined in the\nAct. The dictionary meaning of\r\n‘exposition’, according to the\nCollins\r\nDictionary\n(10 ed) is,\n‘\na systematic, usually written\r\nstatement about, commentary on, or explanation of a specific subject.\r\nThe act of expounding or setting\nforth information or a view point.’\nIn the\nOxford English\r\nDictionary\n(2 ed)\r\n‘exposition’\nis\r\nexplained, as, inter alia,\n‘\nThe action\r\nor process of setting forth, declaring, or describing, either in\r\nspeech or writing. A statement in which any matter is\nset forth in\r\ndetail. The action of expounding or explaining; interpretation,\r\nexplanation.’\nAccording to\nBlack’s\r\nLaw Dictionary\n(9 ed), the meaning of\r\n‘transaction’ is recorded as:\n‘\nThe act or an instance of\r\nconducting business or other dealings; esp. the formation,\r\nperformance, or discharge of a contract. Something\nperformed or\r\ncarried out; a business agreement or exchange. Any activity involving\r\ntwo or more persons. An agreement that is intended\nby the parties to\r\nprevent or end a dispute and in which they make reciprocal\r\nconcessions.’\n[8] The inclusion of the\r\nword\ntransaction\nin the section clearly\r\nindicates that there must be agreement between the parties concerned,\r\nbefore the process created by s 63\ncan be set in motion. Section\r\n63(3) contains references to the ‘proposed transaction’.\r\nThe further subsections, namely,\n63(5), (6), (7), (13) and (14) also\r\nrefer to the ‘proposed transaction’. The proposed\r\ntransaction is, in my view, the\nunderlying agreement between the\r\nparties and governs the terms of the amalgamation or transfer\r\ncontemplated in the section. The\nsubmission that there can be an\r\namalgamation or transfer without an underlying transaction is without\r\nmerit. Further support for\nthis view is to be found in s 63(16) which\r\nprovides that:\n‘\nA\ntransaction\nin terms of this section shall not\r\ndeprive any creditor of a party thereto, other than in his or her\r\ncapacity as a member or a shareholder\nof such party of any right or\r\nremedy which he or she had immediately prior to the date of the\ntransaction\nagainst any party to the transaction\r\nor against any member or shareholder or officer of such party.’\r\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe scheme created by s\r\n63 clearly envisages a ‘transaction’ between the parties\r\nconcerned relating to their amalgamation.\n[9] Having regard to its\r\nordinary dictionary meaning, an exposition, as used in the section,\r\nis intended to explain and comment\non the underlying transaction.\r\nWithout an underlying transaction there would be nothing to explain\r\nor deliver comment on. The parties\nmust, in the exposition, explain\r\nthe terms upon which they have agreed. The exposition may contain\r\nmore detail than the transaction\nitself. This becomes clear when\r\nregard is had to the further requirement in s 63(2) that the\r\nexposition must be accompanied by\nevery actuarial or other statement\r\ntaken into account for the purpose of the transaction and particulars\r\nof ‘the voting at\nany meeting of its members at which the\r\nproposed transaction was considered’.\n1\nIf the voting of members\r\nof the medical scheme(s) is a precondition for the validity of the\r\nproposed transaction, then details of\nsuch voting should ideally be\r\nsubmitted with the exposition. At the very latest, details of the\r\nvoting should be provided to the\nRegistrar before the latter\r\nconsiders the exposition and makes a decision in respect thereof.\n[10] By letter dated 22\r\nSeptember 2010, the Registrar was advised that the members of Suremed\r\nhad voted overwhelmingly against the\nmerger. Suremed requested the\r\nwithdrawal of the exposition, alternatively that ‘the Registrar\r\ndeclines to confirm the exposition\non the basis that there is no\r\nagreement between Thebemed and Suremed to merge as the Suremed\r\nmembers failed to approve such proposed\nmerger’. The Registrar\r\ndeclined to withdraw the exposition and in a letter to Suremed dated\r\n28 September 2010 wrote that,\n‘\n1. Rule 31.3 requires that 50%\r\nof [Suremed’s] members return their ballots voting in favour of\r\nthe amalgamation before it\ncan be concluded in terms of Section 63 of\r\nthe Act. Furthermore, [Suremed’s] rules do not provide for the\r\nRegistrar to ratify\na lesser percentage of votes received where the\r\nscheme could not attain the required percentage. As the number that\r\nvoted on the\nproposed merger is less than 50% of the number of\r\nmembers of the scheme hence the requirements of rule 31.3 have not\r\nbeen met.\n…\n.\nNotwithstanding the above issues, the\r\nposition of this office is that an amalgamation is a legal process\r\nwhich is guided by section\n63 of the Act. The Suremed board has\r\nsigned the exposition document and resolved to merge with Thebemed\r\nMedical Scheme and is therefore\nnot in the position to withdraw from\r\nthe process.’\n[11] The Registrar\r\nconfirmed the exposition on 29 September 2010. The Registrar was thus\r\naware, prior to confirming the exposition\nthat the proposed\r\ntransaction was in conflict with Suremed’s rules and that the\r\nmembers had voted against it. It was also\nclear that the trustees of\r\nSuremed had no authority to conclude the merger agreement. It was\r\nargued, on behalf of the appellants,\nthat the Registrar could, in\r\nterms of s 63(11), confirm an exposition even if the proposed\r\ntransaction was in conflict with the\nrules of the scheme concerned.\r\nThere is no merit in this submission and this will be dealt with\r\nlater in this judgment.\n[12] The Registrar may\r\nalso request that a medical scheme provide him with a report on the\r\nproposed transaction by an expert nominated\nby the Registrar.\n2\nThe exposition and the\r\nexpert’s report, if any, must lie open for inspection at the\r\nregistered offices of the parties involved\nin the transaction and at\r\nthe Registrar’s office for at least 21 days.\n3\nIt was contended, on\r\nbehalf of the appellants, that once a party has knowledge of the\r\nexposition and willingly participates in the\nprocess provided for in\r\ns 63, and in particular allows the exposition to lie open for\r\ninspection, it was not possible for such\nparty to contend that it has\r\nnot consented to the proposed transaction, as the process was then\r\nunder the control of the Registrar.\nThere is also no merit in this\r\nsubmission. It is absurd to suggest that a transaction can be foisted\r\nupon a party in circumstances\nwhere such party has not agreed to a\r\nmerger or transfer of business, but merely because such party has, in\r\nsome way, participated\nin the process created by s 63. As has already\r\nbeen pointed out, a transaction is an agreement based on consensus\r\nbetween the parties.\nIt must also be borne in mind that medical\r\nschemes are voluntary associations and s 63 must be interpreted in\r\nthe context of freedom\nof association and the right of members to\r\ncontrol the destiny of their association.\n[13] The Registrar may\r\nalso require a medical scheme to forward the exposition and the\r\nexpert’s report, if any, to its members\nand creditors\n4\nand to give notice of the\r\nproposed transaction by publication in the Government Gazette and in\r\nany such newspaper(s) as the Registrar\nmay direct.\n5\nAfter the exposition and\r\nthe expert’s report has lain open for inspection, interested\r\nparties have 21 days to make representations\nto the Registrar on the\r\nproposed transaction.\n6\n[14] Subsections 63(6) to\r\n(10) sets out the powers of the Registrar in relation to confirmation\r\nof the exposition. The Registrar\nmay confirm the exposition.\n7\nHe may suggest that the\r\nparties modify the exposition before he confirms it.\n8\nHe may decline to confirm\r\nthe exposition.\n9\nThe Registrar may only\r\nconfirm the exposition if he is satisfied that the transaction would\r\nnot be detrimental to the interests\nof the majority of the\r\nbeneficiaries of the medical scheme(s) concerned and that the medical\r\nscheme(s) remaining after the transaction,\nwill remain in or attain a\r\nsound financial condition.\n10\n[15] The consequences\r\nthat flow from confirmation of the exposition are dealt with in\r\nsubsections 63(11) and (13) to (17). Section\n63(11) reads as follows:\n‘\nAny exposition confirmed by the\r\nRegistrar or the Council in accordance with this section shall be\r\nbinding on all parties concerned,\nand shall have effect\r\nnotwithstanding any conflicting provision contained in the rules of\r\nany medical scheme concerned, in the\nmemorandum or other document\r\nunder which any other party to the transaction is constituted or in\r\nthe articles of association or\nother rules of such party.’\nConfirmation gives\r\nimmediate legal effect to the exposition and makes it binding on the\r\nparties to the transaction, despite any\nprovision to the contrary in\r\nthe rules of the medical scheme(s) or other instruments of any of the\r\nparties. Confirmation of the\nexposition immediately brings about the\r\ntransfer of the assets and liabilities envisaged in the exposition in\r\nterms of subsections\n63(14), (15) and (17).\n[16] Relying on the\r\nprovisions of s 63(11), it was argued, on behalf of the appellants,\r\nthat once the exposition has been confirmed\nby the Registrar, it was\r\nnot open to a party to contend that the transaction underpinning the\r\nexposition was not valid. It was\nfurther argued that the exposition\r\nbecomes the primary instrument in accordance with which the\r\ntransaction takes effect and is\nimplemented. To find otherwise, so\r\nthe argument went, would defeat the object of the section because\r\nthen the Registrar would be\ncalled upon to regulate a transaction\r\nthat may not have been disclosed to him.\n[17] This argument is\r\nmisplaced. Section 63(11) does not authorise a medical scheme to\r\nenter into a transaction that is in conflict\nwith its rules. This\r\nsubsection does not deal with the requirements of an exposition but\r\nrather with the situation between the\nparties post amalgamation or\r\ntransfer and after the exposition has been confirmed by the\r\nRegistrar. The process itself, however,\nbegins with and is dependant\r\non a binding transaction. There cannot be an amalgamation or transfer\r\nwithout a valid transaction.\nThe transaction is not valid if, for\r\nexample, it is in conflict with the rules of the scheme concerned or\r\nwith legislation. The\ntransaction between the parties is explained in\r\nthe exposition. Section 63(11) says no more than that the\nconfirmed\nexposition shall be\r\nbinding despite any conflict there may be between the exposition and\r\nthe rules of the scheme or its memorandum.\nSection 63(11) does not,\r\nas I have said, authorise the medical scheme or its board, to enter\r\ninto a transaction that is in conflict\nwith or not sanctioned by its\r\nrules.\n[18] The purpose of s 63\r\nis to regulate transactions between parties relating to amalgamations\r\nor transfer of businesses to or from\nmedical schemes. This section\r\ngives the Registrar a supervisory role and as has already been\r\nmentioned above, he has to be satisfied\nthat such transactions will\r\nnot be detrimental to the interests of the majority of the\r\nbeneficiaries of the medical scheme(s) concerned\nand that the medical\r\nscheme(s) remaining after the transaction, will remain in or attain a\r\nsound financial condition. The first\nstep in the process is a valid\r\ntransaction between the parties of the kind envisaged in s 63. In\r\norder for such a transaction to\nbe performed or be of any force or\r\neffect, the provisions of s 63 have to be complied with. Compliance\r\nwith the section, entails,\ninter alia, the filing of a document,\r\nreferred to as an exposition, explaining in detail the terms of the\r\ntransaction. The contention\nby the appellants that there can be an\r\nexposition without a valid underlying agreement between the parties,\r\ncannot be sustained.\nThe section does not obviate the necessity of an\r\nagreement between the parties.\n[19] The appeal is\r\ndismissed with costs, including those of two counsel.\n_______________\nL V THERON\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances:\n1\nST\nAppellant: W Trengove SC (with F Ismail)\nInstructed by: Eversheds, Sandton\nSymington & De Kok, Bloemfontein\n2\nND\nAppellant: L J Morison SC (with P Strathern)\nInstructed\r\nby: Brian Khan Inc, Johannesburg\nClaude Reid Inc Bloemfontein\nRespondent: M S M Brassey SC (with K\r\nHopkins and\nD Van Zyl)\nInstructed by: Webber Wentzel\r\nAttorneys,\nJohannesburg\nMcIntyre & Van Der Post,\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nSection\r\n\t63(2) reads:\n‘\nThe\r\n\tmedical scheme contemplated in subsection (1) shall deposit with the\r\n\tRegistrar a copy of the exposition of the proposed transaction,\n\n\tincluding a copy of every actuarial or other statement taken into\r\n\taccount for the purpose of the proposed transaction, and shall\n\n\tfurnish the Registrar with particulars of the voting at any meeting\r\n\tof its members at which the proposed transaction was considered\nand\r\n\twith such additional information as the Registrar may require.’\n2\nSection\r\n\t63(3)(a).\n3\nSection\r\n\t63(4).\n4\nSection\r\n\t63(3)(b).\n5\nSection\r\n\t63(3)(c).\n6\nSection\r\n\t63(5).\n7\nSection\r\n\t63(6)(a).\n8\nSection\r\n\t63(6)(b).\n9\nSection\r\n\t63(6)(c).\n10\nSection\r\n\t63(7).",

    "facts": "Suremed Medical Scheme, a small scheme with only 1,576 members, fell short of the statutory minimum of 6,000 members required by the Medical Schemes Act. The Registrar repeatedly urged Suremed to increase its membership and warned that failure to do so by April 2010 would result in an enforced amalgamation. Suremed identified Thebemed Medical Scheme as a suitable partner and the two schemes signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 19 April 2010, agreeing in principle to merge subject to member approval. An exposition of the proposed merger was prepared and lodged with the Registrar on 1 July 2010. Member polls were conducted: Thebemed members approved the merger, but a majority of Suremed members voted against it. On 22 September 2010 Suremed requested the Registrar withdraw the exposition; the Registrar declined and, on 29 September 2010, confirmed the exposition despite the lack of member approval. Suremed appealed to the Medical Schemes Appeal Board, which dismissed the appeal; the matter was then taken on review to the North Gauteng High Court, which set aside the Registrar’s decision. The Registrar and the Appeal Board’s decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "The central issue was whether, under section 63 of the Medical Schemes Act 131 of 1998, the Registrar of Medical Schemes has the statutory power to confirm an exposition of a proposed amalgamation when there is no valid underlying agreement between the parties – specifically where the merger has been rejected by the members of one scheme and the scheme’s board lacks authority to proceed.",
    "principles": "Section 63 provides the framework for amalgamations and transfers of business between medical schemes. It requires a ‘transaction’ – i.e., a binding agreement between the parties – before an exposition can be submitted. The term ‘exposition’ is merely a detailed statement of that underlying transaction. Section 63(11) makes a confirmed exposition binding notwithstanding conflicts with scheme rules, but it does not create authority to validate a transaction that is itself invalid or contrary to the scheme’s constitution. The Registrar’s role is supervisory: he may confirm an exposition only if satisfied that the transaction is lawful, not detrimental to beneficiaries, and that the schemes will remain financially sound.",
    "application": "The Court examined the language of section 63, emphasizing the repeated reference to a ‘proposed transaction’ and concluding that a valid agreement between the schemes is a pre‑condition for the statutory process. Because Suremed’s members rejected the merger and the board therefore lacked authority, no valid transaction existed. Consequently, the exposition could not be lawfully confirmed. The Registrar’s reliance on section 63(11) was rejected, as that provision applies only after a valid transaction has been confirmed, not to create a transaction where none exists. The High Court’s finding that the Registrar exceeded his statutory power was affirmed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision, confirming that the Registrar of Medical Schemes had no power to confirm an exposition that was not underpinned by a valid, member‑approved agreement. The confirmation of the exposition was set aside."
