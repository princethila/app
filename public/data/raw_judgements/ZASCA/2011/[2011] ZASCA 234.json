More particularly,\nit raises the question as to\r\nthe effect of a restraining order under s 26 of POCA on the\r\nassets of a company in liquidation\nwhere that order is made after the\r\npresentation of an application for the winding-up of the company, but\r\nbefore the actual winding-up\norder is granted.\n[2] The\r\nrelevant facts are briefly these. On 19 November 2008\r\nBMI-Techknowledge Group (Pty) Ltd, a creditor of Aquila Holdings\r\n(Pty) Ltd (Aquila), launched an application in the Western Cape High\r\nCourt for the liquidation of Aquila on the basis that it was\nunable\r\nto pay its debts. On 10 March 2010 Aquila was placed in provisional\r\nliquidation. It was finally wound up on 10 May 2010.\nIn the interim,\r\non 3 July 2009,\nthe\r\nrespondent (the NDPP) obtained a provisional restraint order in an\r\napplication launched under s 26 of POCA\n1\nin respect of\r\nthe realisable property of Aquila, Aquila’s sole director and\r\nshareholder, Mr Francois Kleinhans, and other\nentities linked to it.\r\nIn terms of this order, 490 shares owned by Aquila in Optipharm\r\nHealthcare (Pty) Ltd, a company in which\nit had 70 per cent\r\nshareholding, were provisionally restrained and Mr Stephen Powell was\r\nappointed as\ncurator\r\nbonis\nwith\r\nthe mandate to take possession of the shares which Aquila was ordered\r\nto surrender to him.\n[3] On 24 May 2010 the\r\nappellants, then Aquila’s joint provisional liquidators,\r\nlaunched an application seeking leave to intervene\nin the restraint\r\nproceedings and a variation of the restraint order releasing the\r\nshares from its ambit by virtue of s 36(2) of\nPOCA on the basis that\r\nAquila’s winding-up had started before the restraint order was\r\ngranted. This, in their opinion meant\nthat Aquila’s assets fell\r\nto be administered by them. On 2 December 2010 the court below (per\r\nFourie J) simultaneously heard\nthe NDPP’s application for the\r\nconfirmation of the provisional restraint order (which was not\r\nopposed) and the intervention\napplication. By then the appellants had\r\nbecome Aquila’s liquidators.\n[4] The court below acknowledged\r\nthe appellants’ right to intervene in terms of s 28(2)(a) of\r\nPOCA but dismissed their application\nand confirmed the provisional\r\nrestraint order without variation. The gist of its reasoning was that\r\ns 36(1) has no application\nin the matter, and that on the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the provisions of s 36(2), its operation is triggered only\r\nif the winding-up\norder has actually been granted when the restraint\r\norder is made, which did not happen in this case. The appellants\r\nchallenge this\ndecision with the leave of the court below.\n[5] Section 36 of POCA reads:\n‘\nEffect\r\nof winding-up of companies or other juristic persons on realisable\r\nproperty\nWhen any competent\r\n\tcourt has made an order for the winding-up of any company or other\r\n\tjuristic person which holds realisable property\nor a resolution for\r\n\tthe voluntary winding-up of any such company or juristic person has\r\n\tbeen registered in terms of any applicable\nlaw–\n(a) no property for\r\nthe time being subject to a restraint order made before the relevant\r\ntime; and\n(b) no proceeds of\r\nany realisable property realised by virtue of section 30 and for the\r\ntime being in the hands of a\ncurator bonis\nappointed under\r\nthis Chapter,\nshall form part of\r\nthe assets of any such company or juristic person.\n(2) Where an order\r\nmentioned in subsection (1) has been made in respect of a company or\r\nother juristic person or a resolution mentioned\nin that subsection\r\nhas been registered in respect of such company or juristic person,\r\nthe powers conferred upon a High Court by\nsections 26 to 31 and 33\r\n(2) or upon\ncurator bonis\nappointed under this Chapter, shall\r\nnot be exercised in respect of any property which forms part of the\r\nassets of such company\nor juristic person.\n(3) Nothing in the\r\nCompanies Act, 1973 (Act 61 of 1973), or any other law relating to\r\njuristic persons in general or any particular\njuristic person, shall\r\nbe construed as prohibiting any High Court or\ncurator bonis\nappointed under this Chapter from exercising any power contemplated\r\nin subsection (2) in respect of any property or proceeds mentioned\nin\r\nsubsection (1).\n(4) For the purposes\r\nof subsection (1), “the relevant time” means–\n(a) where an order\r\nfor the winding-up of the company or juristic person, as the case may\r\nbe, has been made, the time of the presentation\nto the court\r\nconcerned of the application for the winding-up; or\n(b) where no such\r\norder has been made, the time of the registration of the resolution\r\nauthorising the voluntary winding-up of the\ncompany or juristic\r\nperson, as the case may be.\n(5)\r\n...’\n2\n[6] I see no ambiguity in the\r\nwording of these provisions. Given their plain meaning and read in\r\ncontext, their operation is governed\nby two jurisdictional facts\r\nenvisaged in both subsecs (1) and (2) – ie the ‘making’\r\nof an order for the winding-up\nof a company and the grant of a\r\nrestraint order in respect of its realisable property. The sequence\r\nin which these two events occur\nis crucial. Section 36(1) presents no\r\ncontroversy. Read with the definition of ‘relevant time’\r\nset out in subsec (4)(a),\nit expressly excludes assets under\r\nrestraint from a company’s estate where the restraint order\r\npreceded the presentation\nto court of such company’s winding-up\r\napplication.\n[7] But POCA bears no description\r\nof the phrase ‘presentation to the court’ which,\r\nincidentally, is used nowhere else\nin the Act but in ss (4)(a). A\r\ncontention made on the appellants’ behalf in this regard was\r\nthat the words must be given\nthe established judicial meaning (to\r\nensure certainty in the law among other reasons) placed upon a\r\nsimilar phrase previously used\nby the Legislature, in respect of a\r\nsimilar subject matter, in s 348 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 (the\r\nCompanies Act).\n3\nThe latter section deals with the\r\ncommencement of a winding-up of a company by a court which is ‘deemed\r\nto commence at the\ntime of the presentation to the Court of the\r\napplication for the winding-up’. In this context, our courts\r\nhave interpreted\nthe words ‘presentation to the Court’ as\r\nmeaning when the application is filed with the Registrar of the\r\ncourt.\n4\n[8]\nThe\r\nrespondent conceded the correctness of these contentions, rightly so\r\nin my view.\nAs\r\npointed out by the appellants’ counsel, s 348 of the Companies\r\nAct, as does s 36(4)(a) of POCA, deals with issues such\nas the timing\r\nof the presentation to court of a company’s winding-up\r\napplication, such application’s impact on the\ncompany’s\r\nassets, the rights of creditors etc. The two sections are\npari\r\nmateria\n.\nAnd\r\nthe Legislature, necessarily aware of its previous use of an\r\nidentical phrase in a similar situation in s 348 of the Companies\nAct\r\nand the subsequent judicial construction ascribed to it by the\r\ncourts, must have intended it to bear the same meaning in s\n36(1) of\r\nPOCA. So, the words ‘presentation to the court concerned’\r\nused in s 36(4)(a) mean, for purposes of determining\nthe ‘relevant\r\ntime’ mentioned therein, when an application for the winding-up\r\napplication of a company is filed with\nthe Registrar of the court.\n[9] The respondent’s\r\nargument, which found favour with the court below, is that s 36(1)\r\ndoes not apply in a case like\nthe present where the restraint order\r\nwas made after the relevant time, that is, after the winding-up\r\napplication was filed with\nthe registrar of the court. I do not agree\r\nwith this argument. It is true that s 36(1) does not deal\r\nexpressly with this situation,\nbut I believe it must be taken to do\r\nso implicitly. What the section expressly provides is that property\r\nof a company which has\nalready been restrained by an order under s 26\r\nof POCA before the relevant date, will not be excluded from the\r\nassets of the\ncompany after winding-up. But logic dictates that the\r\nconverse must equally hold true. Where the restraining order was made\r\nafter\nthe relevant date, the property of the company subject to the\r\nrestraint order must form part of the assets of that company after\n\nwinding-up. As I see it, s 36(1) therefore defines the concept\r\n‘assets of the company’ in liquidation. It excludes\nall\r\nassets subject to a restraining order which preceded the relevant\r\ndate, but includes all assets subject to a restraining order\nwhich\r\nwas granted after the relevant date.\n[10] This brings the enquiry to\r\nthe effect of s 36(2) on the present facts; put differently, are the\r\nshares excluded from the ambit\nof the restraint order? The parties\r\nwere agreed that the assets of a company are not realisable property\r\nif a restraint order follows\nafter a winding-up order has been made\r\nand that they fall outside the purview of the powers vested in a\r\ncourt or a\ncurator bonis\nunder Chapter 5 of POCA. As indicated\r\nearlier, the point of difference relates to whether the section\r\napplies in a case such as\nthe present, where the winding-up\r\napplication preceded a restraint order granted before the company was\r\nfinally wound up. The appellants\nargued that as s 36(1) excludes\r\nproperty from ‘the assets of the company’ where the\r\nrestraint order precedes the relevant\ntime of a winding-up,\nex\r\ncontrariis\nand on a proper construction of its wording, s 36(2)\r\nmust cover any other winding-up in which the restraint does not\r\nprecede the\nrelevant time as long as a winding-up order is ultimately\r\ngranted.\n[11] The main contention made on\r\nthe NDPP’s behalf, on the other hand, was that s 36(2) ‘applies\r\nonly where a court\nis seized with an application for a restraint\r\norder in respect of assets which already fall under the control of\r\nliquidators, because\na winding-up order “\nhas been made\n”\r\nin respect of the company that owns the assets’ with the result\r\nthat the subsection could find no application on the\npresent facts as\r\nno winding-up order had been made when the restraint order was\r\ngranted. Some of the reasons advanced in support\nof this approach\r\nwere that the appellants’ interpretation of the subsection –\n(a) creates a ‘shifting\r\nsituation’, which is not contemplated either by s 36 or the\r\nrest of POCA, in which a court grants\na restraint order (in terms of\r\nwhich a company’s assets are placed under the control of a\ncurator bonis\n) when no winding-up order has been made, but\r\nthen, anomalously, the restraint order, whilst remaining extant,\r\nloses its force consequent\nto the granting of a winding-up order\r\nwhich removes the assets from its ambit and the control of the\ncurator bonis\n;\n(b) impermissibly imports the\r\n‘relevant time’ into s 36(2) as it is explicitly defined\r\nonly ‘for the purposes\nof subsection (1)’ and can have no\r\napplication to subsection (2); and\n(c) is inconsistent with POCA’s\r\nother provisions (for example, s 35 which is a corresponding section\r\ndealing with the property\nof a natural person whose estate has been\r\nsequestrated and s 29(2)(c) which regulates immovable property\r\nsubject to restraint)\nand its structure.\n[12] Put simply, the NDPP’s\r\ninterpretation is that s 36 (2) applies only where the restraint\r\norder is granted after a company\nhas been wound up. I agree with his\r\ncounsel that the trigger for s 36(2) to apply is that a winding-up\r\norder ‘has been made’.\nBut so does\r\ns 36(1). Both subsections find no application at all unless the\r\ncompany is eventually wound up. The first difficulty\nthat arises on\r\nthe construction contended for by the NDPP is that situations will\r\narise which are governed by neither s 36(1)\nor 36(2). If the\r\nrestraining order precedes the relevant date s 36(1) applies, so\r\nhe argued. If the winding-up order comes\nbefore the restraining\r\norder, s 36(2) applies. But what about a situation like the\r\npresent where the restraining order is\ngranted between the relevant\r\ndate and the winding-up order? A further problem raised by the\r\nconstruction contended for by the NDPP\nis that it renders s 36(1)\r\nsuperfluous. Any restraining order that precedes the winding-up order\r\nwill take preference to the\nlatter order and it matters not whether\r\nthe restraining order was granted before or after the relevant date.\r\nIf that was so, the\nwhole field would be covered by s 36(2). I\r\nbelieve it hardly requires any motivation that a construction of s 36\r\nwhich\nrequires one of the subsections to be ignored completely,\r\ncannot be sustained.\n[13]\nThe\r\nNDPP’s argument that ‘relevant time’ is\r\nspecifically defined for the purposes of subsection (1) only, takes\n\nthe matter no further, since that concept is not used in any other\r\nsection.\nFurther, his approach completely ignores the words\r\n‘mentioned in subsection (1)’, in reference to the order\r\nin subsec\n(2), which clearly link the order to which the latter\r\nsubsection refers, to the application envisaged in subsection (1).\r\nWhen the\ntwo subsections are read together, as they must, it\r\ninexorably follows that the application pursuant to which the\r\nwinding-up order\ncontemplated in subsec (2) was made, is that\r\nmentioned in subsec (1). Thus, the ‘relevant time’ of the\r\napplication\nin subsec (1) directly impacts subsec (2) and must be the\r\nsame for both subsections. This construction accords with the scheme\r\nand objectives of s 36 which refers to ‘property which forms\r\npart of the assets of [a] company’ in liquidation in both\nss\r\n(1) and (2): delineating the assets which constitute the estate of a\r\ncompany in liquidation in subsec (1) and providing for\nthose not\r\ncovered by these provisions (which must fall under the liquidator’s\r\ncontrol when a winding-up order is granted)\nin subsec (2).\nIn\r\nshort, s 36(1) defines the ‘assets of the company’\r\nafter winding-up. Section 36(2) tells us what will happen\nto those\r\nassets after winding-up.\nThe wording of subsec (3) appears to\r\nreinforce this view as it seeks to protect from limitation the powers\r\nof the high court and\ncurator bonis\n‘contemplated in\r\nsubsection (2) in respect of\nany property\nor proceeds\r\nmentioned in subsection (1)\n’ (emphasis added).\n[14] The further string to the\r\nNDPP’s bow, his reliance on the differently worded provisions\r\nof s 35 of POCA, does not seem\nto me to lend any support to his\r\ncause. The section provides:\n‘\nEffect\r\nof sequestration of estates on realisable property\nWhen the estate of\r\n\ta person who holds realisable property is sequestrated–\nthe property for\r\n\tthe time being subject to a restraint order made before the date of\r\n\tsequestration; and\nthe proceeds of any\r\n\trealisable property realised by virtue of section 30 and for the\r\n\ttime being in the hands of a\ncurator bonis\nunder this\r\n\tChapter,\nshall not vest in\r\nthe Master of the High Court or trustee concerned, as the case may\r\nbe.\n...\nWhere the estate of\r\n\tan insolvent has been sequestrated, the powers conferred upon a High\r\n\tCourt by sections 26 to 31 and 33(2)\nor upon a\ncurator bonis\nappointed under this Chapter, shall not be exercised–\nin respect of any\r\n\tproperty which forms part of that estate; or\nin respect of any\r\n\tproperty which the trustee concerned is entitled to claim from the\r\n\tinsolvent under\nsection 23\nof the\nInsolvency Act, 1936\n.\nNothing in the\nInsolvency Act, 1936\n, shall be construed as prohibiting any High\r\n\tCourt or\ncurator bonis\nappointed under this Chapter from\r\n\texercising any power contemplated in subsection (3) in respect of\r\n\tany property or proceeds\nmentioned in subsection(1).’\n[15] Quite obviously,\nss 36(1)\nand (2) are the equivalent of\ns 35(1)(a)\nand\n35\n(3)(a), respectively.\r\nBut, in language different to that used in its counterpart,\ns\r\n35(3)(a)\n, unequivocally and without any reference to\ns 35(1)(a)\n,\r\ndeals with the estate of an insolvent that ‘has been\r\nsequestrated’ before the restraint order is made and excludes\n\nproperty constituting that estate from the ambit of the various\r\npowers it confers. And\ns 35(1)(a)\nsimply excludes property subject to\r\na restraint order granted before the sequestration order from the\r\ninsolvent estate without\nmaking any provision for ‘relevant\r\ntime’, as done in\ns 36(1)\n, or any qualification relating to the\r\nfiling of the application for sequestration. The differences in the\r\nrespective provisions\nare far from trifling. They are, in my view,\r\ndeliberate and were clearly meant to distinguish between natural\r\npersons and juristic\nentities because the Legislature could simply\r\nhave used identical language in both scenarios had its intention been\r\nto treat them\nsimilarly. The distinction is not surprising in any\r\nevent in view of the fact that the concept of a winding-up order\r\ncommencing\nretrospectively is unique to company law and has no\r\ncorresponding provision in the law of insolvency. Therefore, the\r\nmeaning of\ns 35(3)\ncannot be attributed to\ns 36(2).\n[16] I find it unnecessary to\r\ndeal with the other points raised on the NDPP’s behalf as they\r\ndo not take the dispute any further.\nTo sum up, the restraint order\r\nmust precede the filing of a winding-up application as otherwise, as\r\nhere by virtue of\ns 36(2)\n, a\nconcursus creditorum\nis\r\nestablished over the assets of the company where the winding-up order\r\nis granted. This situation clearly operates to exclude\nthe restraint\r\norder which must then lie dormant and the\ncurator bonis\nmust\r\nyield his control over the assets to the liquidator. Thus, the\r\nso-called ‘shifting’ phenomenon adverted by the\nNDPP\r\nseems to be precisely what the Legislature intended. In this case,\ns\r\n36(2)\nof POCA excludes the shares from the ambit of the restraint\r\norder granted on 3 July 2009. For these reasons, it was not competent\n\nfor the court below to confirm the provisional restraint order in\r\nrespect of such shares. The appeal must succeed. However, the\n\nappropriate relief is a declaratory order and not a variation of the\r\nrestraint order as was originally sought by the appellants\nbecause,\r\nas pointed out above, the effect of the restraint order is simply\r\nexcluded by operation of the law.\n[17] Accordingly, the following\r\norder is made:\nThe appeal is upheld with costs,\r\n\tincluding the costs of two counsel.\nThe order of the court below is\r\n\tset aside and replaced with the following:\n‘\n(a) The\r\n490 shares in Optipharm Healthcare (Pty) Ltd held by Aquila Holdings\r\n(Pty) Ltd (in liquidation) are excluded from the “Schedule\nof\r\nKnown Assets” reflected in annexure “A” to the\r\nprovisional restraint order of 3 July 2009 (the restraint order),\nand\r\nthe restraint order is varied in this respect.\n(b) The costs of the intervention\r\napplication launched by the first and second intervening applicants\r\nshall be paid by the applicant,\nincluding the costs of two counsel\r\nwhere employed.\n(c) Subject to the aforegoing,\r\nthe restraint order is confirmed against the defendant and\r\nrespondents only in respect of such property\nas held by them at the\r\ndate of this order.’\n___________________\nMML Maya\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFor Appellant: S.

    "facts": "Aqua Holdings (Pty) Ltd was placed in provisional liquidation after a creditor, BMI‑Techknowledge Group, applied for its winding‑up on 19 November 2008. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) obtained a provisional restraint order on 3 July 2009 under s 26 of POCA, restraining 490 shares that Aquila held in Optipharm Healthcare (Pty) Ltd. Aquila was wound up on 10 May 2010. The joint provisional liquidators of Aquila intervened, seeking to have the shares released from the restraint order on the basis that the winding‑up application had been filed before the restraint order was granted.",
    "issues": "The principal issue was how s 36 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act should be interpreted where a restraint order is made after a winding‑up application has been filed but before a winding‑up order is finally granted. Specifically, whether the shares restrained on 3 July 2009 fall outside the ambit of the restraint order pursuant to s 36(2) because the ‘relevant time’ for the winding‑up had already occurred.",
    "principles": "The Court examined the wording of s 36(1)–(4) of POCA, emphasizing that ‘relevant time’ is the date an application for winding‑up is presented to the court, which courts have interpreted as the filing with the registrar (analogous to s 348 of the Companies Act). The Court held that s 36(1) excludes assets restrained before the relevant time, while s 36(2) excludes assets restrained after that time, provided a winding‑up is eventually granted. The provisions must be read together, and the intent is to prevent a ‘shifting’ of control from a curator bonis to a liquidator where the restraint order follows the winding‑up application.",
    "application": "Applying these principles, the Court concluded that the restraint order of 3 July 2009 was made after the relevant time (the filing of the winding‑up application on 19 November 2008). Accordingly, the 490 shares were part of the company's assets after winding‑up and therefore fell outside the scope of the restraint order under s 36(2). The lower court’s confirmation of the restraint order over the shares was therefore erroneous.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The original order was set aside and replaced: the 490 shares were excluded from the Schedule of Known Assets in the provisional restraint order, the restraint order was varied accordingly, costs were awarded to the NDPP (including costs of two counsel), and the restraint order was confirmed only against the remaining property of the defendants."
