As the march\nproceeded, in the Union’s\r\nown words, it ‘descended into chaos’, with admitted\r\nextensive damage caused to vehicles\nand shops along the route.\n[2] The first to eighth\r\nrespondents are individuals who claimed that they had sustained loss\r\nas a result of the riot. At least one\nof the respondents claims to\r\nhave been assaulted. They all instituted action in the Western Cape\r\nHigh Court, Cape Town, against\nthe Union in terms of s 11 of the Act,\r\nalternatively under the common law, to recover the damages they had\r\nallegedly sustained\nand for which they contended the Union was\r\nliable. Section 11(1) of the Act creates a statutory liability on the\r\npart of organisations\nunder whose auspices a gathering or\r\ndemonstration was held that degenerated into a riot causing damage to\r\nothers.\n1\n[3] Section 11(2) of the\r\nAct sets out three factors that a defendant to such an action has to\r\nprove in order to escape liability.\nSection 11(2) reads as follows:\n‘\nIt\r\nshall be a defence to a claim against a person or organization\r\ncontemplated in subsection (1) if such a person or organization\n\nproves ─\n(a)\nthat\r\nhe or it did not permit or connive at the act or omission which\r\ncaused the damage in question; and\n(b)\nthat the act or omission\r\nin question did not fall within the scope of the objectives of the\r\ngathering or demonstration in question\nand\r\nwas not reasonably foreseeable\n;\r\nand\n(c)\nthat he or it took all\r\nreasonable steps within his or its power to prevent the act or\r\nomission in question: Provided that proof\nthat he or it forbade an\r\nact of the kind in question shall not by itself be regarded as\r\nsufficient proof that he or it took all\nreasonable steps to prevent\r\nthe act in question.’ (My emphasis.)\n[4] In defending the\r\naction the Union, in addition to denying liability in general terms,\r\nalso contended that s 11(2)\n(b)\n,\r\nparticularly the part highlighted above, places too great a burden on\r\ntrade unions and other organisations and individuals who\nintended to\r\nassemble to protest publicly. It was submitted that it has a\r\nstultifying effect on the rights set out in s 17 of the\nConstitution:\n‘\nEveryone\r\nhas the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate,\r\nto picket and present petitions.’\n[5] Put differently, it\r\nwas contended that, faced with the onerous task of proving what is\r\nrequired by s 11(2)\n(b)\n,\r\nunions, other organisations and individuals would be deterred from\r\norganising marches, protests and other gatherings for fear\nof\r\nfinancial ruin. Thus, it was contended that s 11(2)\n(b)\nwas unconstitutional in\r\nthat it offended against the right entrenched in s 17 of the\r\nConstitution in terms of which everyone has\nthe right ‘peacefully\r\nand unarmed’, to assemble, demonstrate, picket and to present\r\npetitions.\n[6] In the paragraphs\r\nthat follow, I turn to consider the allegations by the respondents\r\nabout the riot as experienced by them and\nthe resultant damage\r\nallegedly sustained by them. The allegations in relation to the\r\nfirst, second and sixth respondents that appear\nin those paragraphs\r\nare drawn from affidavits filed by them, after an order by the court\r\nbelow in terms of which the issue of the\nconstitutionality of s\r\n11(2)\n(b)\nwas, in terms of Uniform\r\nrule 33(4), to be heard prior to and separately from the other issues\r\nin the case,\n2\nand from their\r\nparticulars of claim. The assertions by the third, fourth, fifth,\r\nseventh and eight respondents are drawn from their\nparticulars of\r\nclaim.\n[7] The first respondent,\r\nMs Jacqueline Garvis, alleged that at the time of the riot she was a\r\nstreet vendor selling items such\nas travel bags, school bags,\r\nwallets, etc at a location just outside Grand Central. She described\r\nhow, on the morning in question,\na group of marchers pushed through a\r\ngate to the market where her stall was located. One of the persons in\r\nthe group used a pole\nwith which he smashed her stall. Parts of the\r\ncrowd looted her stall and robbed her of all her stock. She was\r\nstruck on her body\nwith a pole and was traumatised by the events. She\r\nalleged that the replacement value of the goods lost by her was R3\r\n805.\n[8] The second\r\nrespondent, Ms Thuraya Naidoo, is a flower seller who does business\r\non the pavement alongside Adderley Street, near\nthe intersection with\r\nDarling Street, in the centre of Cape Town. She alleges that she was\r\naware that the Union had organised a\nmarch for the 16 May 2006. On\r\nthat day she was going about her business as usual when, at\r\napproximately 11h30, a huge crowd approached\nand a group of marchers\r\ntrampled her flowers. She was terrified as she witnessed her business\r\nand stock being destroyed. According\nto Ms Naidoo it took her months\r\nto pay off her debt to the person who supplies the flowers she sells\r\nin her business. She alleged\nthat the replacement value of the\r\nflowers lost by her is R6 687.50.\n[9] The sixth respondent,\r\nMs Dolores Reitz, recalls that on that morning she was in her car at\r\na set of traffic lights in Darling\nStreet. At the time, she was a\r\nmanager of a photographic shop in the Strand Concourse and was on the\r\nway back there from a goods\nsupplier. Suddenly, she was surrounded by\r\na group of marchers who smashed her car with sticks and their fists.\r\nThe car was consequently\nbadly damaged and she was terrified. In her\r\nparticulars of claim she alleged that she had suffered damages in the\r\namount of R5\n584.71.\n[10] The fourth\r\nrespondent, Mr Anees Soeker, is a carpenter who claimed that his\r\nmotor vehicle was vandalised during the march,\ncausing him to sustain\r\ndamages in an amount of R17 043.53.\n[11] The fifth\r\nrespondent, Mr Andrew Njiokwuemegi, a customs clearance officer, also\r\nalleged that his car was vandalised during\nthe march, causing him to\r\nsustain damages in an amount of R11 458.23.\n[12] The seventh\r\nrespondent, Mr Maurice Robertson, a businessman, claimed that he\r\nhad his motor vehicle vandalised during the\nmarch and that he\r\nsustained damages in an amount of R5 864.25.\n[13] Finally, the eighth\r\nrespondent, Mr Harold Burger, who is self-employed, stated that his\r\nmotor vehicle was vandalised by marchers\nand that he consequently\r\nsustained damages in an amount of R18 599.15.\n[14] In an affidavit\r\nfiled in the proceedings in the court below subsequent to the order\r\nin terms of Uniform rule 33(4), Mr B J\nEngelbrecht Botha, who is\r\nemployed as legal advisor to the Speaker of the City of Cape Town,\r\nstated that in the riot following\non the march, participants began\r\nbreaking windows, damaging cars and looting stores, causing damage\r\nestimated to be in the region\nof R1.5 million. Most of the damage was\r\ndone to motor vehicles. According to him, several people were injured\r\nand about 39 people\nwere arrested. In this regard he referred to a\r\nnewspaper report. This part of his affidavit was uncontested.\n[15] In opposing the\r\naction the Union also served a third party notice on the Minister of\r\nSafety and Security (the Minister), claiming\nin the attached\r\nannexure, that in the event of it being held liable to any or all of\r\nthe respondents it was entitled to a contribution\nfrom him. The Union\r\nalleged that the losses suffered by the respondents were caused, at\r\nleast in part, by the negligent conduct\nof members of the South\r\nAfrican Police Service. They were said to be negligent in the\r\nfollowing respects:\n(a) they failed to ensure\r\nthat adequate numbers of police officers were on hand to man the Cape\r\nTown railway station at the time\nthat the Union’s members\r\narrived from their various departure points;\n(b) they failed to ensure\r\nthat adequate numbers of police officers were on hand to monitor the\r\ngathering and to prevent damage being\ncaused to third parties;\n(c) they failed to ensure\r\nthat the police officers on duty at the gathering were adequately\r\nequipped to deal properly with the marchers\nwho participated in the\r\ngathering;\n(d) they fired rubber\r\nbullets at those participating in the gathering, thereby causing the\r\ngathering to become disrupted and unmanageable\nby the Union’s\r\nmarshals;\n(e) they failed to disarm\r\npersons in unlawful possession of traditional and/or dangerous\r\nweapons;\n(f) the armoured police\r\nvehicle at the head of the march moved unduly slowly, thereby\r\ndisrupting the progress of Union members towards\nParliament, thereby\r\ncausing frustration; and\n(g) they failed to take\r\nall steps reasonably necessary to protect the property of third\r\nparties.\n[16] In addition to\r\ndenying liability on any basis the Union, in a conditional\r\ncounterclaim, sought an order declaring that s 11(2)\n(b)\nis unconstitutional and sought the excision of what it\r\ncontended were the offending parts.\n[17] The Minister entered\r\nthe litigation fray, denying that he was liable on the basis\r\ncontended for on behalf of the Union. The\nMinister pleaded that\r\nmembers of the South African Police Service had taken all reasonable\r\nmeasures to regulate and manage the\ngathering. Furthermore, it was\r\nalleged on behalf of the Minister that the Police Service had\r\nconsulted with the Union prior to\nthe gathering and ascertained such\r\nfacts as were necessary, including the anticipated number of\r\nparticipants. Based on this an\noperational plan was devised by the\r\npolice to determine how best to regulate and monitor the gathering.\r\nThe plan was put into operation\nand it included an adequate number of\r\npolice to deal with the gathering. The Minister denied that members\r\nfired rubber bullets\nunreasonably or unnecessarily. He alleged that\r\nthe armoured vehicles that were deployed were used to regulate and\r\ncontrol the gathering.\n[18] Although it was\r\ninitially indicated on behalf of the Minister that he would abide the\r\nhigh court’s decision he was represented\nduring the hearing of\r\nthe matter in the court below and argument was presented on his\r\nbehalf. The Minister made common cause with\nthe other respondents in\r\ncontending that s 11(2)\n(b)\nwas\r\nnot unconstitutional.\n[19] The separated issue\r\nwas heard by Hlophe JP and was decided against the Union with the\r\nfollowing order being made:\n‘\n(a)\r\nIt is declared that the inclusion of the words “and was not\r\nreasonably foreseeable” in section 11(2)(b) of the Regulation\n\nof Gatherings Act 205 of 1993 is not inconsistent with section 17 of\r\nthe Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n(b) No order as to\r\ncosts.’\nThe present appeal is\r\nbefore us with leave to appeal having been granted by the learned\r\nJudge President.\n[20] In deciding the\r\nmatter the court below had regard to the volatile environment in\r\nwhich the march was organised. This was information\ngleaned from the\r\naffidavit of the Union’s Provincial Secretary. According to him\r\nthe strike in the security sector of industry\nleading up to the march\r\nin question took place in the context of heightened acrimony arising\r\nout of issues between Union members\nand employers and Government. By\r\nthe time the march took place, approximately 50 people had already\r\nbeen killed in strike-related\nviolence. It is uncontested, as\r\nrecorded by the court below, that preceding the march there had been\r\nprevious instances of damage\ncaused to property belonging to the city\r\nand private persons.\n[21] The court below\r\nnoted that the Act had come into operation on 15 November 1996. It\r\nrecorded that preceding legislation had\nmade no provision for civil\r\nliability on the part of organisers or conveners of gatherings.\n[22] Before focusing on\r\nthe specifics of the constitutional challenge by the Union, Hlophe JP\r\nembarked on a careful examination\nof the procedure created by the Act\r\nfor the organisation and notification of an intended gathering. The\r\nAct provides for consultations\nand negotiations in relation to\r\ngatherings. Section 2 states that any organisation or branch of an\r\norganisation intending to hold\na gathering ‘shall appoint . . .\r\na person to be responsible for the arrangements for that gathering\r\nand to be present thereat,\nto give notice in terms of section 3 and\r\nto act on its behalf at any consultations or negotiations\r\ncontemplated in section 4, or\nin connection with any other procedure\r\ncontemplated in this Act.’ Section 2 also contemplates a deputy\r\nto be appointed to\nthe person referred to in the preceding sentence.\r\nSection 2(2)\n(a)\nprovides\r\nthat the Commissioner of police or a person authorised thereto by him\r\nshall authorise a suitably qualified and experienced\nmember of the\r\npolice to represent the police at consultations or negotiations\r\ncontemplated in section 4. It obliges the Commissioner\nto notify all\r\nlocal authorities or any local authority concerned of every such\r\nauthorisation and of the name, rank and address\nof such authorised\r\nmember.\n[23] Section 2(4)\n(a)\nof the Act makes provision for a responsible officer to be appointed\r\nby the local authority with whom the organisers can liaise\nand whom\r\nthey are obliged to notify concerning the identity and particulars of\r\nan intended gathering. Section 3 obliges the convener\nof a gathering\r\nto give formal notice thereof to the responsible officer of the local\r\nauthority. Section 3(3) of the Act sets out\nthe extensive information\r\nthat has to be provided by the convener, including the anticipated\r\nnumber of participants and where possible\nthe number and names of\r\nmarshals to be appointed and how these marshals are to be\r\ndistinguished from the other participants.\n[24] Section 4 obliges\r\nthe responsible officer of the local authority concerned to consult\r\nwith the authorised member of the police\nabout the necessity for\r\nnegotiations concerning any aspect of the conduct of, or any\r\ncondition with regard to the proposed gathering.\nSection 4(2)\n(b)\nenvisages a subsequent meeting involving the convener, the\r\nresponsible officer and the police to reach agreement on the conduct,\n\norganisation and control of the gathering. In the event of a failure\r\nto reach agreement the Act empowers the responsible officer\nto impose\r\nconditions in relation to the intended gathering. Section 5 of the\r\nAct sets out circumstances in which the responsible\nofficer of the\r\nlocal authority may prohibit a meeting. Section 8 of the Act\r\ndetermines the conduct of the convener, marshals and\nparticipants in\r\nthe gathering. It includes the appointment of a number of marshals.\r\nIt requires steps to be taken to ensure orderly\nand peaceful conduct.\n[25] Section 9 sets out\r\nthe powers of the police in relation to a gathering, including the\r\npower to regulate vehicular and pedestrian\nflow. It also deals with\r\nthe use of force by the police to control a gathering.\n[26] That background\r\nleads us to s 11 which, as set out above, forms the statutory basis\r\nfor a claim against organisations or individuals\nwho organise a\r\ngathering that turns into a riot causing damage to others, whilst at\r\nthe same time setting out a basis for avoiding\nliability.\n[27] In dealing with the\r\nsubmissions on behalf of the Union, that s 11(2)\n(b)\nis\r\nunconstitutional, Hlophe JP had regard to the evidence presented by\r\nthe Union and the common cause facts. All the material steps\nrequired\r\nto be taken in terms of the Act had been met by the Union. The Union\r\nhad approximately 500 marshals in attendance and\nappears to have\r\ncommunicated to their members on an ongoing basis that they were to\r\ndesist from unlawful behaviour. They had requested\nthe local\r\nauthority to clear the roads of vehicles and to erect barricades.\n[28] On the strength of\r\nwhat is set out above it was submitted that the Union had taken all\r\nreasonable steps to prevent any harm\nbeing caused to the public. It\r\nwas accepted on behalf of the Union that in the extensive planning\r\ncontemplated in the Act that\nprecedes a gathering, the potential for\r\na breakdown of order is discussed and thus inevitably, harm being\r\nforeseen enters the equation.\nThus it was submitted that it was\r\nalmost impossible for an organisation such as the Union to avoid\r\nliability in terms of the provisions\nof the Act. Put differently, the\r\nUnion and like organisations as well as individuals who convened a\r\ngathering would be unable to\nsatisfy the requirements for a valid\r\ndefence in terms of s 11(2) of the Act because the foreseeability of\r\nharm in the planning\nstages potentially lands it with liability at\r\nsource.\n[29] The court below\r\nrejected the submission that s 11(2)\n(b)\noffended against s 17\r\nof the Constitution, which expressly states that one has a right to\r\nassemble, demonstrate, picket and to\npresent petitions ‘peacefully\r\nand unarmed’. This right, the court below held does not extend\r\nto unlawful behaviour\nat gatherings or where persons bear weapons. It\r\nwas on that basis that the submission was held to be groundless.\n[30] The court below went\r\non to consider the submission on behalf of the Union about the\r\nchilling effect of s 11(2)\n(b)\n, namely, that if allowed to\r\nstand, it would lead to the end of public assembly and protest. In\r\nthis regard the court below found\nit telling that notwithstanding the\r\nprovisions of the Act, with the spectre of looming liability, the\r\nUnion nevertheless proceeded\nwith the gathering. The court below also\r\nhad regard to the affidavit deposed to by the local authority’s\r\nresponsible officer\nthat he frequently warns organisers of gatherings\r\nof the dangers of liability as envisaged in the Act but that his\r\nexperience is\nthat it has no deterrent effect. Hlophe JP also\r\nconsidered against the Union, the affidavit of Colonel Cloete, the\r\nMinister’s\nsenior legal adviser, to similar effect. Both\r\ndeponents stated the indications are to the contrary, that the right\r\nto public assembly\nand protest is frequently being exercised and that\r\nthis is promoted by the overall scheme of the Act and not impeded by\r\ns 11(2).\nImportantly, there was no evidence to the contrary presented\r\nby the Union.\n[31] The court below\r\ndealt with the further submission on behalf of the Union that s 11(2)\r\nof the Act was internally self-destructive\nand therefore incoherent.\r\nIt was contended that this was so because, in all relevant\r\ncircumstances where the defendant discharged\nits duty of taking all\r\nreasonable steps within its power to prevent the act or omission in\r\nquestion, the act or the omission will\nalways be reasonably\r\nforeseeable in terms of s 11(2)\n(b)\n.\r\nIt was submitted that it was not logically possible to take\r\nreasonable steps to prevent an act from occurring if one does not\n\nforesee the possibility of such an act occurring. Thus it was\r\nsubmitted that the defence contained in s 11(2) is illusory and\r\ninherently doomed to failure. Before us it is this latter argument\r\nthat became the focal point of the argument on behalf of the\nUnion.\nConclusions\n[32] It is necessary to\r\nrecord at the outset that counsel on behalf of the Union accepted\r\nthat, if it were held that s 11(2)\n(b)\nwas intelligible, could\r\nbe given content, and afforded a real defence to a statutory claim,\r\nthen it would not be necessary for this\ncourt to proceed, as the\r\ncourt below did, to the limitation exercise provided for in s 36 of\r\nthe Constitution.\n3\nThis means it was\r\naccepted that, whatever the difference between liability in terms of\r\ns 11 of the Act and liability at common law,\nthe difference would be\r\nconstitutionally valid provided that this court found s 11(2)\n(b)\nof the Act to have the\r\nqualities referred to in the preceding sentence. Put differently,\r\ncounsel for the Union conceded that if\ns 11(2) provides a viable\r\ndefence, it constitutes a reasonable and justifiable limitation in\r\nterms of s 36 of the Constitution.\n[33] At common law the\r\ntest for negligence leading to liability finds its clearest statement\r\nin\nKruger\r\nv Coetzee\n1966\r\n(2) SA 428\n(A) at 430E-F. Liability ensues if:\n‘\n(a)\r\na\ndiligens\r\npaterfamilias\nin\r\nthe position of the defendant ─\n(i) would foresee the\r\nreasonable possibility of his conduct injuring another in his person\r\nor property and causing him patrimonial\nloss; and\n(ii) would take\r\nreasonable steps to guard against such occurrence; and\n(b) the defendant failed\r\nto take such steps.’\n[34] In Neethling,\r\nPotgieter and Visser\nLaw\r\nof Delict\n5ed\r\n(2006) p 118 the learned authors correctly state the following:\n‘\nWhether\r\na\ndiligens\r\npaterfamilias\nin\r\nthe position of the person concerned would take any guarding steps at\r\nall and, if so, what steps would be reasonable, must always\ndepend on\r\nthe particular circumstances of each case. No hard and fast basis can\r\nbe laid down.’\n[35] Apart from being\r\ncouched in the negative, because it relates to the setting up of a\r\ndefence, I have some difficulty in understanding\nwhy the provisions\r\nof s 11(2)\n(b)\n,\r\nset out in para 3 above, differ radically or even significantly from\r\nthe common law requirements for liability for negligence.\nIn this\r\nregard I discount questions of whether or not an unjustifiable\r\nreverse onus has been imposed on defendants since this aspect\nwas not\r\npursued before us. As stated above, the appeal was limited to\r\nquestioning the viability of a defence in terms of s 11(2)\n(b)\n.\r\nThis involves considering whether the subsection is intelligible and\r\nwhether it can be applied to the advantage of potential defendants.\n[36] Furthermore, I fail\r\nto see why the statutory defence is illusory and why defences\r\nordinarily available at common law are excluded\nby the provisions in\r\nquestion. A number of examples prove that point. Take the case of the\r\ngathering of thousands of trade union\nmembers with hundreds of\r\nmarshals in attendance and where steps were taken to ensure that\r\nno-one was armed, there was collaboration\nwith the police about the\r\nroute of a protest march and all such eventualities as occurred to\r\nboth the police and the trade union\norganisers were taken into\r\naccount in the planning. That notwithstanding, a riot ensued because\r\none of the policemen in attendance\nhad not engaged the safety catch\r\non his weapon, causing it to discharge as he moved alongside the\r\ncrowd, with the consequence that\nparticipants panicked and stampeded.\r\nIn those circumstances an innocent bystander seeking to hold the\r\ntrade union liable for damages\nwould probably fail at the first\r\nhurdle. That eventuality could hardly have been foreseen by the Union\r\nand if any liability attaches\nit would attach to the police.\n[37] Consider the case of\r\na gathering, where exactly the same precautions as set out in the\r\npreceding paragraph were taken, but\nwhere the march was suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly infiltrated by a gunman unconnected to the trade union,\r\nwho bore a grudge against\nsociety and who started firing\r\nindiscriminately, causing panic. Once again this would not have been\r\nan action that was reasonably\nforeseeable and the trade union faced\r\nwith a claim for damages by a shopkeeper whose shop in the vicinity\r\nof the march was damaged\nwould probably be able to mount a successful\r\ndefence.\n[38] Another imagined\r\ninstance is one where, despite barricades having been agreed and\r\nerected by police and despite marshals and\nthe police taking\r\nprecautions to ensure a free-flow of marchers through the streets and\r\nto prevent incursions by vehicular traffic,\na motorist nonetheless\r\nbreaks through those barricades and drives into the marching crowd\r\ncausing panic and a riot with resultant\ndamage to persons and\r\nproperty. I fail to see how in those circumstances the trade union\r\ncould be held liable.\n[39] In all three\r\ninstances it would have been clear that the actions following upon\r\nthe unforeseen events did not form part of\nthe purpose of the\r\ngathering and it would have been equally clear that the Union did not\r\npermit or connive in the actions that\ncaused the panic that led to\r\nloss being sustained by others. Furthermore, the Union would have\r\ntaken all reasonable steps to ensure\nthat a stampede or unruly\r\nbehaviour did not occur.\n[40] It was submitted\r\nthat the conjunctive nature of the provisions of s 11(2)\n(b)\nrelating to a defendant was especially pernicious, because at common\r\nlaw all a defendant needed to show to escape liability, when\nsued in\r\na delictual action based on negligence, was that a reasonable person\r\nin his or her position would not have foreseen the\nreasonable\r\npossibility of his or her conduct injuring another in their person or\r\nproperty, causing damage to be sustained. The\nabsence of that factor\r\nalone would usually mean that a defendant would escape liability. The\r\nplaintiff, on the other hand, would\nhave had to meet the\nKruger v\r\nCoetzee\ntest set out in para 33 above in its entirety.\n[41] Even though the\r\nconjunctive nature of the defence set out in s 11(2)\n(b)\nof the\r\nAct, on the face of it, seems burdensome one can only take reasonable\r\nsteps in respect of conduct that is reasonably foreseeable.\nIt does\r\nappear that unless the act complained of ─ leading to the riot\r\n─ was reasonably foreseeable, a defendant would\nprobably in all\r\nof the instances set out above escape liability. One can only take\r\nsteps to guard against an occurrence if one\ncan foresee it.\n[42] As stated above, it\r\nwas submitted on behalf of the Union that when an intended gathering\r\ntakes place where there is a threat\nof violence, it is inevitable\r\nthat the content of the discussions between the police and organisers\r\ndeals with the potential for\ninjury to persons or damage and that\r\ntherefore it will always unjustifiably be contended against\r\norganisations such as unions that,\nbecause they foresaw that\r\neventuality, they should be held liable. It was contended that it was\r\nakin to strict liability being\nimposed on organisations which\r\norganise gatherings.\n[43] In the present case,\r\naccording to the testimony of the Union’s own representative,\r\nevents leading up to the march had\nled to a volatile situation. The\r\nstrike had been protracted and acrimonious and there had been many\r\ndeaths. In those circumstances\nit is arguable that no degree of\r\nmeasures could be taken so as to prevent the march from degenerating\r\ninto a riot. Even at common\nlaw it would appear that a defendant who\r\npersisted in organising a march in those circumstances would almost\r\ninevitably be landed\nwith liability. Put differently, if one persists\r\nin organising an event where it is reasonably foreseeable that no\r\nmeasure or means\ncould be employed to prevent it from degenerating\r\ninto a riot, then when that eventuality occurs one could hardly be\r\nexpected to\nescape liability for the harm caused to persons or\r\nproperty. In short, a reasonable trade union would not persist in\r\norganising\nand proceeding with a march in the circumstances sketched\r\nin this paragraph.\n[44] Furthermore, it\r\nmight well be that the separated question in terms of Uniform\r\nrule 33(4) was premature in that the reasons\nfor the gathering\r\ndegenerating into a riot had not yet factually been established.\r\nHaving the question of the constitutionality\nof s 11(2)\n(b)\ntested in a vacuum was undesirable. What, if at a trial in due\r\ncourse, it is established that some Union marshals were instrumental\n\nin the gathering turning into a riot? What if the evidence\r\nestablishes that some Union officials made inflammatory speeches\r\npreceding\nthe march, and that this had the effect of causing a riot?\r\nIn those circumstances the provisions of the Act or the application\r\nof common law principles would almost inevitably mean the Union would\r\nbe held liable for damages sustained by innocent third parties.\nCould\r\nit rightfully be said that in those circumstances the ensuing\r\nstatutory liability offended against constitutional values\nand norms?\r\nI think not. It is arguable that, in the circumstances set out above,\r\ncommon law liability would attach to the Union\nand the exploration of\r\nthe constitutional point would be unnecessary. What if the factor\r\nthat caused the riot was wholly unconnected\nto the march and could\r\nnot have been foreseen by any one of the actors envisaged by the Act?\r\nIn those circumstances one can hardly\nimagine that liability could\r\nattach to the Union either statutorily or at common law.\n[45] The reasons for the\r\nriot ought to be properly explored by the trial court in due course.\r\nThis court has repeatedly warned that\npiecemeal litigation is not to\r\nbe encouraged. Sometimes parties consider issues to be discrete and\r\nsubmit that a decision on a\nseparated issue would lead to an\r\nexpeditious disposal of the litigation, but that submission and\r\nagreement on separation often\nturns out to be ill-advised. In this\r\nregard see\nDenel\r\n(Edms) Bpk v Vorster\n2004\r\n(4) SA 481\n(SCA) para 3 and\nConsolidated\r\nNews Agencies (Pty) Ltd (in liquidation) v Mobile Telephone Networks\r\n(Pty) Ltd & another\n2010\r\n(3) SA 382\n(SCA) paras 89 and 90. The Constitutional Court has\r\ncommented on the undesirability of matters being referred to it where\r\nfacts\nare in dispute.\n4\nIt has also commented on\r\nthe difficulties of dealing with complex questions of law,\r\nconstitutional or otherwise, and being called\nupon to engage in the\r\nlimitation exercise, presently provided for in s 36 of the\r\nConstitution, as a court of first instance. The\nConstitutional Court\r\nhas stated that it should not be called upon to do so in\r\ncircumstances in which a decision on the constitutional\nissue might\r\nnot be decisive for the case.\n5\nBe that as it may, we are\r\ncalled upon to consider whether the court below, with the material\r\navailable to it was correct in its\nultimate conclusion.\n[46] During the\r\npre-constitutional era public protests and demonstrations against a\r\ndenial of fundamental human rights were often\nmet by brute force with\r\nresultant loss of life. The Sharpeville massacre and the 1976 Soweto\r\nstudent uprising are stark examples\nthat are etched into the national\r\npsyche. In any event, the legislature, after an extensive\r\nconsultative process, and following\non the brutal experiences of the\r\nApartheid era, promulgated the Act.\n6\n[47] Our Constitution saw\r\nSouth Africa making a clean break with the past. The Constitution is\r\nfocused on ensuring human dignity,\nthe achievement of equality and\r\nthe advancement of human rights and freedoms. It is calculated to\r\nensure accountability, responsiveness\nand openness.\n7\nPublic demonstrations and\r\nmarches are a regular feature of present day South Africa. I accept\r\nthat assemblies, pickets, marches\nand demonstrations are an essential\r\nfeature of a democratic society and that they are essential\r\ninstruments of dialogue in society.\nThe Constitutional Court has\r\nrecognised that the rights presently enjoyed by employees were\r\nhard-won and followed years of intense\nand often grim struggle by\r\nworkers and their organisations.\n8\nThe struggle for workers’\r\nrights can rightly be expected to continue. Trade unions should\r\nensure that a noble struggle remains\nunsullied. The Act was designed\r\nto ensure that public protests and demonstrations are confined within\r\nlegally recognised limits\nwith due regard for the rights of others.\n[48] I agree with the\r\ncourt below that the rights set out in s 17 of the Constitution,\r\nnamely, the right to assemble and demonstrate,\nare not implicated\r\nbecause persons engaging in those activities have the right to do so\r\nonly if they are peaceful and unarmed.\nIt is that kind of\r\ndemonstration and assembly that is protected. Causing and\r\nparticipating in riots are the antithesis of constitutional\nvalues.\r\nLiability in terms of s 11 follows on the unlawful behaviour of those\r\nparticipating in a march. The court below rightly\nhad regard to\r\nsimilar wording in the Constitution of the United States, where\r\npeople are given the right to assemble peacefully.\nSuch provisions in\r\nconstitutions such as ours are deliberate. They preclude challenges\r\nto statutes that restrict unlawful behaviour\nin relation to\r\ngatherings and demonstrations that impinge on the rights of others.\n9\n[49] It was submitted on\r\nbehalf of the Union that damage to public property caused by a\r\ngathering that degenerated into a riot was\na small price to pay to\r\npreserve and protect the precious right to public assembly and\r\nprotest, which is integral to a democratic\nstate. I agree with the\r\ncourt below that members of the public are entitled to protection\r\nagainst behaviour that militates against\nthe rule of law and the\r\nrights of others and that, if liability is to attach to unlawful\r\nbehaviour at a gathering that causes a\nriot, it would seem just and\r\nin accordance with constitutional values that it should attach to the\r\norganisers in the circumstances\ncontemplated in s 11 of the Act. As\r\nstated above the Union’s legal representatives therefore\r\nrightly accepted that if s 11(2)\n(b)\ncould be given content,\r\nas described above, it would not be necessary for us to proceed to\r\nthe limitation exercise contemplated\nin s 36 of the\r\nConstitution. For the reasons set out above I do not find the\r\nprovisions of s 11(2)\n(b)\ninternally contradictory\r\nand self-destructive. It appears to me to be structured in such a\r\nmanner as to ensure that liability should\nattach where it rightly\r\nbelongs.\n[50] The chilling effect\r\nof s 11(2)\n(b)\ndescribed on behalf of\r\nthe Union is not only unsubstantiated but is contradicted by the\r\npolice and the City of Cape Town, who presented\nunchallenged evidence\r\nthat in their extensive experience the provisions of the Act have not\r\ndeterred people from public assembly\nand protest. If anything, the\r\nregularity of public assembly and protest in the 15 years of the\r\nexistence of the Act proves the\ncontrary. The chilling effect that\r\nthe provisions of the Act should rightly have is on unlawful\r\nbehaviour that threatens the fabric\nof civilised society and which\r\nundermines the rule of law. In the past the majority of the\r\npopulation was subjected to the tyranny\nof the state. We cannot now\r\nbe subjected to the tyranny of the mob.\n[51] Before us it was\r\nsubmitted on behalf of the Union that the provisions of the Act were\r\ntoo wide and presented the spectre of\nlimitless liability for\r\norganisers of gatherings. It was submitted that organisers might be\r\nliable even for conduct that strictly\nspeaking was not unlawful. In\r\nthis regard we were referred to the definition of ‘riot damage’\r\nin the Act which:\n‘\n.\r\n. . means any loss suffered as a result of any injury to or the death\r\nof any person, or any damage to or destruction of any property,\n\ncaused directly or indirectly by, and immediately before, during or\r\nafter, the holding of a gathering.’\nIt was contended that\r\ndefinition was overly wide and that liability would ensue even in the\r\nabsence of fault.\n[52] The submission\r\nreferred to in the preceding paragraph is fallacious. The definition\r\ncannot be read without considering the\nordinary meaning of the word\r\n‘riot’ which is: ‘a violent disturbance of the\r\npeace by a crowd’.\n10\nThe entire scheme of the\r\nAct, including s 11, is designed to prevent unlawful violent\r\nbehaviour that impinges on the rights of others\nand to ensure that\r\npersons or organisations which organise assemblies that degenerate\r\ninto riots should bear liability.\n[53] For all the reasons\r\nset out above, the appeal must fail. Because of the constitutional\r\nissue raised there should, like in the\ncourt below, be no order as to\r\ncosts.\n[54] The appeal is\r\ndismissed and no order is made as to costs.\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor Appellant: E Fagan SC\nS Miller\nInstructed by\nBernadt Vukic Potash &\r\nGetz Cape Town\nLovius-Block Bloemfontein\nFor 1\nst\n- 8\nth\nRespondents: A Katz SC\nD Cooke\nInstructed by\nFairbridges Cape Town\nMcIntyre & Van Der\r\nPost Bloemfontein\nFor 9\nth\nrespondent: K Pillay\nInstructed by\nThe State Attorney Cape\r\nTown\nThe State Attorney\r\nBloemfontein\n1\nSection\r\n\t11(1) provides:\n‘\nIf\r\n\tany riot damage occurs as a result of-\n(a)\na\r\n\tgathering, every organization on behalf of or under the auspices of\r\n\twhich that gathering was held, or, if not so held, the convener;\n(b)\na\r\n\tdemonstration, every person participating in such demonstration,\nshall, subject to\r\n\tsubsection (2), be jointly and severally liable for that riot damage\r\n\tas a joint wrongdoer contemplated in Chapter\nII of the Apportionment\r\n\tof Damages Act, 1956 (Act 34 of 1956), together with any other\r\n\tperson who unlawfully caused or contributed\nto such riot damage and\r\n\tany other organisation or person who is liable therefor in terms of\r\n\tthis subsection.’\n2\nThe\r\n\tcourt below, in ordering the separation, granted leave to any party\r\n\twishing to adduce evidence in relation to the constitutional\npoint\r\n\tto do so by filing affidavits.\n3\nSection\r\n\t36 recognises that fundamental rights may be limited only in terms\r\n\tof law of general application to the extent that the\nlimitation is\r\n\treasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based\r\n\ton human dignity, equality and freedom, taking\ninto account all\r\n\trelevant factors including:\n‘\n(a)\r\n\tthe nature of the right;\n(b) the importance of\r\n\tthe purpose of the limitation;\n(c) the nature and\r\n\textent of the limitation;\n(d) the relation between\r\n\tthe limitation and its purpose; and\n(e) less restrictive\r\n\tmeans to achieve the purpose.’\n4\nVan\r\n\tder Spuy v General Council of the Bar of South Africa (Minister of\r\n\tJustice and Constitutional Development, Advocates for Transformation\n\n\tand Law Society of South Africa Intervening)\n[2002] ZACC 17\n;\n2002 (5) SA 392\n(CC).\n5\nS\r\n\tv Bequinot\n[1996] ZACC 21\n;\n1997 (2) SA 887\n(CC) para 15.\n6\nThe\r\n\thistory leading up to the promulgation of the Act, dealing in\r\n\tparticular with the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry regarding\nthe\r\n\tPrevention of Public Violence and Intimidation are set out in\r\n\tWoolman, Roux, Klaaren, Stein, Chaskalson and Bishop\nConstitutional\r\n\tLaw of South Africa\n(2ed) vol 3, pp 43-4 to 43-7.

    "facts": "On 16 May 2006 the South African Transport & Allied Workers’ Union organised a protest march in Cape Town’s City Bowl. The march, which stemmed from a protracted security‑sector strike, descended into chaos, with extensive damage to vehicles, shops and other property. Eight individual respondents (including street vendors and motorists) and the Minister of Safety and Security sued the Union under section 11 of the Regulation of Gatherings Act 205 of 1993, alleging liability for the riot‑induced damage. The Union argued that section 11(2)(b), requiring the act to be \"not reasonably foreseeable\", placed an unconstitutional burden on the right to peaceful assembly in section 17 of the Constitution.",
    "issues": "The central issue was the constitutional validity of section 11(2)(b) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act: (1) whether it infringes the freedom of peaceful assembly protected by section 17 of the Constitution; (2) whether it creates an impermissible chilling effect on the organisation of public protests; (3) whether the provision is internally contradictory or self‑destructive, rendering the defence illusory.",
    "principles": "The Court applied constitutional limitation analysis under section 36, balancing the right to assemble against the need to prevent unlawful violent conduct. It examined the common‑law negligence test from Kruger v Coetzee (foreseeability and reasonable steps) and compared it with the statutory defence in section 11(2). Precedents on constitutional limitation (Van der Spuy, S v Bequinot) and the interpretation of statutory language were also considered. The Court held that the right to assemble is limited to peaceful, unarmed gatherings and that the statutory defence does not impose a reverse onus inconsistent with constitutional guarantees.",
    "application": "The Court found that the Union had complied with the procedural requirements of the Act, appointed marshals, communicated disapproval of unlawful conduct, and sought police assistance and barricades. While the environment was volatile, the Union could not have foreseen the specific rioting actions, and it had taken reasonable steps to prevent damage. Consequently, the requirement that the act be \"not reasonably foreseeable\" did not render the defence void, nor did it conflict with section 17. Evidence showing no chilling effect on public assembly further supported the validity of the provision.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The Court declared that the inclusion of the words \"and was not reasonably foreseeable\" in section 11(2)(b) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act is not inconsistent with section 17 of the Constitution. No order as to costs was made."
