During 2005\r\nthe Act was amended twice and the amendments came into effect on 1\r\nJuly 2008 (the amended Act).\n1\nThe appellants allege\r\nthat, save in so far as the transitional provisions protect their\r\nrights, the amended Act has deprived them\nof the business which they\r\nhave been conducting in terms of the Act. They seek to preserve their\r\nrights under the Act pending an\napplication by the South African\r\nDiamond Producers Organisation (‘SADPO’), of whom they\r\nare all members, aimed at obtaining\nan order declaring certain\r\nprovisions of the amended Act to be unconstitutional.\n[3] The respondents are,\r\nrespectively, the Minister, the department, the SA Diamond &\r\nPrecious Metal Regulator established in\nterms of the Act and the\r\nofficial in the employ of the third respondent, tasked with the\r\nimplementation of the Act and the amended\nAct. Only the second and\r\nthird respondents opposed both the application and this appeal and I\r\nwill refer to them, for the sake\nof convenience, as the respondents.\n[4] At the outset the\r\nrespondents contested the appealability of the order of the court\r\nbelow. The refusal of an interim interdict\nis, in principle,\r\nappealable.\n2\nThe question of\r\nappealability is, however, by no means a simplistic one.\n3\nThe facts of this case\r\nsuggest that the relief sought in the court below was aimed at\r\npreserving the status quo of the vested business\ninterests of the\r\nappellants, pending the determination of the main application that\r\nwould definitively decide the rights of the\nparties. The effect of\r\nthe refusal of the interim interdict is, therefore, final in\r\ndeclining to preserve the status quo. A consideration\nof this issue\r\non appeal does not constitute an undesirable piecemeal approach to\r\nthe matter. Without delving too deeply into the\nissue I accept in\r\nfavour of the appellants that the order by the court below is\r\nappealable.\n[5] The respondents also\r\nsubmitted that the appellants’ notice of appeal is defective\r\nbecause it does not ‘state in\nwhat manner the variation of the\r\norder of the Court a quo is sought’.\n4\nThe appellants’\r\nnotice of appeal may strictly fall short of the rule, but as the\r\nrelief sought in the court below was refused\nand the appeal is noted\r\nagainst ‘the whole of the judgment and costs order’, it\r\nis obvious that the appellants seek\nthe reversal of the refusal and\r\nthe granting of the relief contained in the notice of motion.\r\nAlthough sloppiness and a lack of\ndiscipline is by no means\r\nencouraged, the notice of appeal has not caused prejudice and the\r\nmatter should be decided on its merits.\n[6] To have achieved\r\nsuccess the appellants would have had to persuade the court below\r\nthat if their factual allegations were accepted,\ntogether with the\r\nrespondents’ allegations that could not be disputed by the\r\nappellants, and if regard was had to the inherent\nprobabilities, they\r\ncould have obtained final relief in the main application. Once that\r\nexercise produced an answer in the appellants’\nfavour, only\r\nserious doubt cast on the appellants’ case by the respondents’\r\nallegations could have prevented the granting\nof interim relief.\n5\nIn addition the\r\nappellants had to have persuaded the court below that they had a well\r\ngrounded apprehension of irreparable harm\nif interim protection was\r\nnot afforded, that the balance of convenience favoured them and that\r\nthey had no other adequate remedy.\n6\n[7] Integral to an\r\ninterim interdict is the need to show that proceedings which address\r\nthe principal dispute between the parties\nare intended or pending. In\r\nthe founding affidavit this aspect is addressed as follows:\n‘\nOn 20 December 2007 SADPO\r\nissued an application out of the above Honourable Court under case\r\nnumber 98085/07 against the first and\nsecond respondents herein (“the\r\nmain application”) to –\n24.1 set aside the coming into\r\noperation by proclamation published on 12 July 2007 in Government\r\nGazette No. 30071, Volume 505,\nNo. R17 of 2007 of the First and\r\nSecond Amendment Acts respectively;\n24.2 declare as unconstitutional\n24.2.1 certain sections of the Acts;\n24.2.2 the arbitrary deprivation of\r\nthe rights accrued to tender houses in consequence of certain\r\nsections of the Second Amendment\nAct; and\n24.2.3 set aside the Regulations made\r\nunder that Act.’\nThe appellants do not\r\nrefer to the specific provisions of the amended Act that are being\r\nattacked in the main application. That\nfailing is repeated in the\r\npresent proceedings.\n[8] The first appellant\r\nis the holder of a valid certificate issued by the South African\r\nDiamond Board (SADB) in terms of s 26 of\nthe Act which entitles it to\r\noperate a diamond exchange at designated premises. The second\r\nappellant is a shareholder and director\nof the first appellant and\r\nthe holder of a licence as a diamond dealer in respect of the same\r\npremises. The third to fifth appellants\nare all diamond dealers on\r\nthe strength of similarly issued diamond dealers’ licences. The\r\nsixth appellant is a newly formed\ncompany and has applied for a\r\nlicence as a diamond dealer in terms of the amended Act, which has\r\nnot yet been issued. The sixth\nappellant therefore has no rights that\r\nrequire protection and can, for that reason, be ignored for purposes\r\nof this judgment.\n[9] The appellants place\r\nmuch reliance in their founding affidavit on a judgment granting an\r\ninterim interdict in the same division\nof the high court, by the same\r\njudge and, seemingly, on the same issue and against the same\r\nrespondents in favour of one\nMeyer\r\nDiamonds CC\nwhich\r\nheld a diamond exchange certificate. The only value of the judgment\r\nin the\nMeyer\nmatter is that it may\r\nhave constituted a precedent for the court below. However, it was\r\ndistinguished by the court below and not\nfollowed. (Whether the\r\ndistinction was justified is not something I need decide.) In fact\r\nthe only significance of\nMeyer\nfor this court is that a\r\nlarge portion of the founding affidavit incorporates allegations made\r\nin the\nMeyer\npapers. The incorporated\r\nallegations describe the details of what is called ‘the tender\r\nbusiness’ and in the present\napplication all the applicants\r\nalign themselves with the\nMeyer\nmatter in this regard.\n[10] The appellants\r\nallege that they have established, in terms of the Act prior to the\r\namendments, a business described by them\nas a ‘tender business’\r\nwhich is made unlawful by the amendments. The explanation in the\r\nfounding affidavit of the tender\nbusiness is given by quoting several\r\nparagraphs from the\nMeyer\nmatter. In summary, local\r\nlicensed diamond dealers are assisted by unlicensed foreigners in the\r\npurchase of unpolished diamonds\nfrom other local licensed dealers\r\nlike themselves. This practice, so they allege, ensures that they\r\ncome into contact with international\ntraders and obtain the best\r\npossible price commensurate with international, as opposed to local,\r\nmarkets. It also ensures a commission\nfor the local licensed dealers\r\ninvolved that are not the sellers in the transaction. Significantly,\r\nthe appellants refer to this\nas a ‘de facto’ practice and\r\ndistinguish it from the ‘de jure’ position. This\r\ndistinction illustrates the\nfundamental flaw in the appellants’\r\ncase.\n[11] The appellants do\r\nnot refer to a single provision in the Act that suggests that a\r\npractice such as their tender business is\nor ever has been\r\nlegitimate. On the contrary the Act is aimed at the prevention of all\r\ndealing in, possession of and the purchase\nand sale of unpolished\r\ndiamonds at premises not licensed and by persons not licensed to do\r\nso.\n7\nThe tender business\r\ndescribed involves the dealing in unpolished diamonds by unlicensed\r\nforeigners. To refer to assistance by unlicensed\nforeigners distorts\r\nthe truth in that it identifies the unlicensed foreigner as the one\r\nwho ‘assists’ the licensed\ndealers whereas it is the\r\nlicensed dealers who assist the unlicensed foreigner and earn\r\ncommission by doing so.\n[12] The appellants rely\r\nsolely on a letter from the SADB for the legitimacy of the tender\r\nbusiness. They do not attach the letter\nto their papers, but allege\r\nthat it is dated 21 March 1993, was written by the SADB, and was\r\naddressed and sent to every licensed\nrough diamond dealer and cutter\r\nin South Africa. Reliance on the letter is explained as follows in\r\nthe founding affidavit:\n‘\n7.2 According to this letter,\r\nlicensees were no longer permitted to be assisted, when viewing and\r\npurchasing diamonds, by anyone\nwho was not a licensee or the\r\nAuthorised Representative of a licensee.\n7.3 The letter made it very clear that\r\nthis condition applied to\nselling\r\noffices\n(section 48(1)(d))\r\nand\nbuying offices\n(section 48(2)(d)) exclusively.\n7.4 The letter went on to state\r\ncategorically and unequivocally that (and I quote for convenience of\r\nthe court from the letter as\nfollows):\n“\nPlease note, however, that the\r\nBoard’s decision\ndoes\r\nnot apply\nto the viewing or\r\npurchasing of diamonds on any of the following premises:\n7.4.1 the premises of the Diamond\r\nBourse of S A;\n7.4.2\nthe business premises of a\r\nlicensed cutter or dealer (the particulars of such a premises are\r\nreflected on a cutter or dealer’s\nlicense)\n; and\n7.4.3 the premises of Trans Hex in\r\nParow.”’\n(Their\r\nemphasis)\n[13] These allegations\r\ncontain an apparent conflict between para 7.4.2 of the quoted letter\r\nand para 7.2 of the excerpt from the\nfounding affidavit that purports\r\nto contain a summary of part of the letter. It is extraordinary that\r\nthe appellants seek to establish\na prima facie right on the contents\r\nof a letter which is not placed before the court. The court is not\r\nput in a position to interpret\nthe letter for itself and assess the\r\ncogency of the allegation that it gave rise to a legitimate practice.\r\nThe respondents also\ndo not deal conclusively with this letter. They\r\ndo not deny the letter or the rendition of its contents by the\r\nappellants but allege\nthat the letter has been superseded by the\r\nlicence conditions of each of the appellants. I will return to this\r\naspect.\n[14] The exclusion in\r\npara 7.4.2 of the letter relied upon by the appellants is contrary to\r\nthe provisions of the Act even before\nthe amendments were passed.\r\nAlthough the applicants do not allege that the letter had been\r\nwritten in terms of the provisions of\ns 30 of the Act, which gives\r\nthe SADB the power to determine, cancel, vary or impose conditions in\r\nrespect of licenses issued,\nthis is the only provision that they\r\ncould possibly rely on for the legitimacy of the exclusion.\n8\nHowever, it goes without\r\nsaying that the SADB could not possibly allow exemptions contrary to\r\nthe Act. But even if that is ignored,\ns 30(3), in peremptory terms,\r\nobliges the executive officer of the SADB to endorse ‘on the\r\nlicence any cancellation, variation\nor condition referred to’\r\nin s 30(2). Section 30(4) gives the executive officer the necessary\r\npowers to require that a licensee\nsubmits a licence to be endorsed.\r\nThe appellants are silent as to whether this was done or had to be\r\ndone in consequence of the\nletter. Their case does not contain the\r\nnecessary averments required to establish the alleged exclusion in\r\nthe letter that legally\nentitled them to develop the ‘de facto’\r\ntender business that they rely on. A fortiori, they have not\r\nestablished even\na prima facie right.\n[15] I return to the\r\nrespondents’ answer to the letter. All the dealers’\r\nlicences, except that of the fourth appellant,\nattached to the\r\nfounding affidavit are dated after 21 March 1993. It is inconceivable\r\nthat the licences would not have been endorsed\nwith the exemption\r\nrelied on by the appellants, if it legitimately existed. Section 29\r\nof the Act compels the endorsement of any\nlicence with the conditions\r\ndetermined by the SADB.\n9\nWhen the licences were\r\nissued without this all important exemption the appellants were\r\nwithin their rights to seek endorsement in\nterms of s 30. They make\r\nno allegations to this effect nor do they make out a case that their\r\nlicences were issued reflecting the\nincorrect conditions. The\r\nconditions reflected on all licences attached to the papers are in\r\ndirect conflict with the exemption\nrelied upon by the applicants.\r\nEach one includes the following condition:\n‘\nThe licensee’s authorised\r\nrepresentative(s) may when viewing or purchasing unpolished diamonds\r\non a premises approved in terms\nof Section 48(1)(d) (selling office)\r\nor a premises approved in terms of section 48(2)(d) (buying office),\r\nonly be assisted by another\nlicensee or a natural person registered\r\nas an authorised representative in terms of section 54 of the\r\nDiamonds Act, 1986’.\n[16] The fourth appellant\r\nis affected in precisely the same manner as all the others despite\r\nthe fact that its licence was issued\nin 1988, because there is no\r\nendorsement on the licence consistent with the alleged exemption and\r\nno attempt to explain why the\nprovisions of s 30(3) and (4) were not\r\nemployed to have it endorsed to reflect the alleged true conditions\r\nof its licence.\n[17] The respondents’\r\nanswer to the appellants’ allegations is a persistent and\r\nunequivocal denial that the tender business\ndescribed and relied upon\r\nby the appellants is legal in terms of the Act. They contend that the\r\namended Act does not bring about\nanything new in this regard. This\r\nview accords with the provisions of the Act. The allegations by the\r\nappellants provide a context\nto the amended Act which reveals that\r\nthe amended Act seeks to root out, in express terms, an illegal\r\npractice that has developed\ncontrary to the provisions of the Act.\n[18] The second to fifth\r\nappellants have not established a case in respect of the first\r\nrequirement of an interim interdict and\nrightly failed to obtain\r\nrelief in the court below.\n[19] The second\r\nappellant, as the shareholder and director of the first appellant,\r\ndeposed to the founding affidavit. As already\nmentioned the founding\r\naffidavit contains an extensive quotation from the founding affidavit\r\nin the\nMeyer\nmatter. The applicant in\nMeyer\nwas the holder of a\r\ndiamond exchange certificate, like the first appellant. At first\r\nblush it seems strange that the holder of a\ndiamond exchange\r\ncertificate would place so much emphasis in its founding affidavit on\r\nthe case for the holder of a diamond dealer’s\nlicence. A closer\r\nlook reveals that the first appellant has an interest that is closely\r\nlinked to and dependent upon the second\nappellant’s diamond\r\ndealer’s licence. It is that close link which puts another\r\nperspective on the first appellant’s\ncase as a diamond\r\nexchange: it is not a mere complaint that the amended Act does not\r\nprovide for a certificate to operate as a\ndiamond exchange. If the\r\nfirst appellant’s case was as simple as that, there was no need\r\nfor it to pay any attention to the\ntender business of the diamond\r\ndealers in its founding affidavit and likewise in the\nMeyer\nmatter. The identity of\r\ninterest is, however, clear if the case of the diamond dealers and\r\nthe diamond exchange is read together,\nas it is presented in this\r\nmatter. It is the access to and contact with unlicensed persons,\r\nprimarily foreigners, that creates\nthe first appellant’s export\r\nmarket.\n[20] The explanation in\r\nthe founding affidavit as to how a diamond exchange operates confirms\r\nthis conclusion:\n‘\nAnyone wishing to export a\r\nrough diamond (eg the South African Licensee in consortium with the\r\nforeigner who had won a parcel on\na “tender”) may place\r\nit on a Diamond Exchange duly registered as such in terms of section\r\n47 of the Act.’\nThe export business of\r\nthe first appellant stems from dealing with unlicensed foreigners, an\r\nillegal practice in terms of the Act\nthat the amended Act seeks\r\nexpressly to forbid.\n[21] Although it is\r\ntechnically correct that there no longer exists a diamond exchange\r\ncertificate in terms of the amended Act,\nthe implication argued for\r\nby the first appellant – that it would no longer be able to\r\nexport diamonds - is not correct.\nThe certification of premises as a\r\ndiamond exchange in terms of the Act has been replaced by the\r\ncertification of premises as a\ndiamond trading house. The first\r\nappellant has already applied in terms of the amended Act for its\r\npremises to be certified as\na diamond trading house and that\r\napplication is pending. The procedures for the export of diamonds in\r\nterms of the Act as amended\nare similar to those in place previously,\r\nwith two important differences. First, diamond trading houses would\r\nnot be entitled to\nmake contact and enter into transactions with\r\nunlicensed foreigners that would lead to the export of unpolished\r\ndiamonds to them;\nand second, export duty exemption has been\r\nabolished by s 115 of the Taxation Amendment Laws Act 8 of 2007. The\r\nabolition of the\nexport duty exemption is not attacked by the\r\nappellants. In so far as the first difference is concerned, contact\r\nwith unlicensed\nforeigners in terms of the express terms of the\r\namended Act has to take place at prescribed premises and export of\r\nunpolished diamonds\nto them occurs in terms of the same procedure as\r\noperated in terms of the Act and as described in the founding\r\naffidavit.\n10\n[22] In the appellants’\r\neagerness to align themselves with\nMeyer\nas a consequence of the\r\nsuccess obtained in that matter, they have not made allegations\r\npertinent to any imminent threat which they\nare facing or the extent\r\nof the harm they may suffer if an interim interdict was not granted.\r\nThe extensive quote from\nMeyer\nin the founding affidavit\r\ncontains allegations of threats leveled by the respondents to close\r\ndown\nMeyer\r\nDiamonds’\nbusiness.\r\nIt also contains details of the income that could be earned as a\r\ntender business and a diamond exchange. In this matter\nthe appellants\r\nhave made only vague allegations of threats resulting from a refusal\r\nby the respondents to agree to extend to them\nthe same protection\r\nobtained in\nMeyer\n.\r\nNo allegations are made of the extent of income that would be lost,\r\nrelative to their total income, as a result of the implementation\nof\r\nthe amended Act.\n[23] The second amendment\r\nto the Act introduced transitional provisions to the effect that if\r\napplication is made for a licence\nor certificate in terms of the\r\namended Act within one year of the coming into operation of the\r\namended Act, the licence or certificate\nin existence in terms of the\r\nAct remains operative until the applications in terms of the amended\r\nAct are decided.\n11\nIt is common cause that\r\nall the appellants had applied within the required one year period\r\nfor the comparable licences and certificates\nin terms of the amended\r\nAct and that no decision has yet been made on those applications.\r\nThey can therefore continue their legitimate\ntrade in terms of the\r\nprovisions of the Act.\n[24] Assuming, however,\r\nin favour of the appellants, that the appropriate official could at\r\nany stage, without notice, take a decision\non the new applications\r\nand that a threat is constituted in that way, the appellants face the\r\ndifficulty that they have not disclosed\nwhat harm such a decision\r\nwould cause them, if any.\n[25] The appellants\r\nsubmitted in their founding affidavit, and persisted with that stance\r\nduring the hearing, that s 31(9) is ‘void\nfor uncertainty’\r\nbecause it refers to a date before ‘section 4 of this Act takes\r\neffect’ and that this reference\nis incomprehensible as s 4\r\ndeals with the ‘objects of the Regulator’. The date\r\nreferred to is 1 July 2008, the date\nthe amended Act came into\r\noperation, because the reference to s 4 in s 31(9) seeks to inform\r\nlicensees that licences in terms of\nthe Act would continue in\r\noperation for a limited period, namely, one year after the coming\r\ninto operation of the amended Act.\nThis is clearly how s 31(9) has\r\nbeen understood by all parties in this matter and reflects the\r\nobvious intention of the legislator.\n[26] For the reasons\r\nstated the appeal is dismissed with costs, including the costs of two\r\ncounsel.\n_________________\nS SNYDERS\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor\r\nappellants: J J Gauntlett SC (with him N Jagga)\nInstructed by David\r\nKotzen Attorneys, Edenvale\nLovius- Block,\r\nBloemfontein.\nFor\r\nrespondents: I Semenya SC (with him T Machaba)\nInstructed by The State\r\nAttorney, Pretoria,\nThe\r\nState Attorney, Bloemfontein.\n(On\r\nbehalf of the 1\nst\n& 2\nnd\nRespondents)\n1\nThe\r\n\tamendments were introduced by the\nDiamonds Amendment Act 29 of 2005\nand the\nDiamonds Second Amendment Act 30 of 2005\n.\n2\nAfrican\r\n\tWanderers Football Club (Pty) Ltd v Wanderers Football Club\n1977 (2) SA 38\n(A) at 47C-48H;\nCronshaw\r\n\t& another v Coin Security Group (Pty) Ltd\n[1996] ZASCA 38\n;\n1996\r\n\t(3) SA 686\n(A) at 690B-691G;\nKnox\r\n\tD’Arcy Ltd & others v Jamieson & others\n[1996] ZASCA 58\n;\n1996 (4) SA 348\n(A) at 356H-360D.\n3\nHealth\r\n\tProfessions Council of South Africa v Emergency Medical Supplies and\r\n\tTraining CC t/a EMS\n2010 (6) SA 469\n(SCA) paras 14-19.\n4\nSCA\nrule 7(3)(b)\nrequires an appellant to ‘state the particular\r\n\trespect in which the variation of the judgment or order is sought’.\n5\nWebster\r\n\tv Mitchell\n1948 (1) SA 1186\n(A) at 1189;\nGool v Minister of\r\n\tJustice\n1955 (2) SA 682\n(C) at 688E.

    "facts": "The appellants are operators in the South African diamond industry who hold certificates and licences under the Diamonds Act 56 of 1986. The Act was amended twice, with the amendments taking effect on 1 July 2008. The appellants claim that the amendments render unlawful their long‑standing ‘tender business’, which involves local licensed dealers cooperating with unlicensed foreign persons to purchase unpolished diamonds for export. They sought an interim interdict in the North Gauteng High Court to preserve the status quo pending a main application by the South African Diamond Producers Organisation (SADPO) challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the amended Act. The High Court refused the interdict and the appellants appealed.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the refusal of an interim interdict is appealable. 2. Whether the appellants satisfied the statutory requirements for an interim interdict – a well‑grounded apprehension of irreparable harm, favourable balance of convenience and lack of an alternative remedy. 3. Whether the appellants have a prima facie right to continue the ‘tender business’ under the original Act or any letter issued by the South African Diamond Board. 4. The interpretation of the licence conditions imposed by sections 29, 30 and 48 of the Diamonds Act and their relationship to the alleged exemption.",
    "principles": "The court applied the established test for granting an interim interdict: the applicant must show a likely right to relief on the merits, a real risk of irreparable injury, that the balance of convenience favours the applicant and that no other adequate remedy exists. It affirmed that a refusal of an interim interdict is appealable where it determines the status quo. The court also relied on statutory interpretation principles, emphasizing that licence conditions set out in sections 29 and 30 are peremptory and cannot be overridden by an unendorsed letter, and that the transitional provisions of section 31(9) allow existing licences to continue for one year after the amendment.",
    "application": "The court found that the appellants did not identify any specific provision of the Act that authorised their ‘tender business’; the letter they relied upon was not placed before the court and was not endorsed on their licences. All licences attached to the record contained conditions prohibiting assistance by unlicensed foreigners, contrary to the claimed exemption. Consequently, the appellants failed to demonstrate a prima facie right to the disputed practice, nor did they establish any imminent or irreparable loss that would be caused by the refusal of the interdict. The appeal was therefore dismissed as the requirements for an interim interdict were not met.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel."
