He was sentenced\nto six (6) years’\r\nimprisonment with two (2) years suspended for five (5) years on\r\ncertain conditions in respect of the fraud\ncounts, which were taken\r\ntogether as one for purposes of sentence, and three (3) years’\r\nimprisonment in respect of the count\nof corruption. His appeal to the\r\nWestern Cape High Court, Cape Town failed and leave to appeal to this\r\ncourt was refused. This\nappeal, which is against his convictions in\r\nrespect of the fraud charges and the sentences imposed on him, is\r\nwith leave of this\ncourt.\n[2] Although the\r\nfacts of this case are convoluted, I shall extract from them what I\r\nconsider to be essential and largely common\ncause. This matter\r\ninvolves fraud against the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The\r\nthree key protagonists are the appellant,\nMr Ian Wiid (Wiid) and Mr\r\nFrederick Carstens Geldenhuys (Geldenhuys). The appellant worked as\r\nthe sales manager of Reeds Motors,\na motor dealer in Observatory,\r\nCape Town. He was responsible for the purchase and sale of motor\r\nvehicles. Wiid was the sole owner\nof two motor dealerships, known as\r\nQuattro Trade and Wholesalers (Quattro) and Auto Haven Motors CC\r\n(Auto Haven), whilst Geldenhuys\nwas the manager of both Quattro and\r\nAuto Haven.\n[3] Although there\r\nis some conflict between the appellant’s version and that of\r\nWiid and Geldenhuys regarding how they started\nto do business\r\ntogether, it is not in dispute that between October 1997 and December\r\n1998 the appellant, purporting to act on behalf\nof Reeds Delta,\r\nsupplied vehicles to Quattro. The appellant explained that as he was\r\neager to expand Reeds Delta’s business\nof exporting vehicles to\r\nNamibia, he telephoned a dealer in Namibia, Mr Lewellyn Anthony\r\n(Anthony) and offered him a vehicle for\nsale. As Anthony did not know\r\nthe appellant he was reluctant to do business with him. Instead, he\r\nrecommended that he take the\nvehicle to Wiid who would inspect it on\r\nhis (Anthony’s) behalf and advise him about its condition.\r\nSince Anthony was satisfied\nwith the condition of the vehicle as\r\nadvised by Wiid, he agreed to purchase it through Wiid who was better\r\nknown to him. It appears\nthat Wiid felt that the appellant was\r\ninterfering with his market in Namibia and expressed his displeasure\r\nto the appellant. Although\nthe evidence is not clear as to when this\r\noccurred, it is not in dispute that an arrangement was then put in\r\nplace in terms of\nwhich Reeds Delta would use Quattro for all its\r\nvehicle exports to Namibia. It was agreed that Reeds Delta would be\r\nresponsible\nfor completion of all invoices and the necessary\r\ndocumentation whilst Quattro would act as sales agent for Reeds\r\nDelta.\n[4] Purporting to\r\nact in terms of the agreement the appellant prepared offers to\r\npurchase and invoices which he sent with the vehicles\nto Quattro. In\r\naddition, the appellant also furnished Quattro with Common Customs\r\nArea forms (CCA1) duly completed and reflecting\nthe names of the\r\npurchasers in Namibia. The invoices were all written for ‘export\r\nto Namibia only’ and reflected the\nparticulars of the\r\npurchasers in Namibia. According to the appellant Quattro was\r\nsupposed to export these vehicles to the consignees\nmentioned in the\r\ninvoices and offers to purchase.\n[5] It is common\r\ncause that by exporting the vehicles to Namibia, Reeds Delta would be\r\nable to have them zero-rated for purposes\nof Value Added Tax (VAT).\r\nIn other words Reeds Delta would not be obliged to pay any output VAT\r\non such vehicles to the Receiver\nof Revenue (SARS) whereas, if it\r\nsold them locally, there would have been a legal obligation to pay\r\noutput VAT. The appellant testified\nthat he was under the impression\r\nthat the vehicles which he delivered to Quattro were exported as per\r\nthe invoices and the CCA1\nforms to the consignees in Namibia.\r\nHowever, the appellant conceded that he did not, on his own, verify\r\nif the vehicles were exported\nto the purchasers in Namibia as he\r\nbelieved that Quattro would export them. According to the appellant,\r\nhe only discovered much\nlater that not all the vehicles which he had\r\ndelivered to Quattro were exported, but, on his own admission, did\r\nnothing to correct\nthe situation.\n[6] The appellant’s\r\nversion conflicts directly with that of the respondent as deposed to\r\nby Wiid, Geldenhuys and Ms Jeanette\nRiley (Riley). The combined\r\nversion of both Wiid and Geldenhuys is that it is the appellant who\r\ncame up with the scheme to sell\nvehicles to Quattro which would be\r\ndisguised as exports so that Quattro would not have to pay output VAT\r\non them. In order to facilitate\nthe scheme, the appellant would\r\nprepare all the necessary documentation which included an offer to\r\npurchase and an invoice accompanied\nby a CCA1 form. The CCA1 form is\r\nessential proof that a particular vehicle whose details are reflected\r\non it has in fact been taken\nacross the border as an export to the\r\nconsignee in Namibia. It is then submitted to SARS as proof that\r\noutput VAT is not payable\non the transaction.\n[7] The CCA1 form\r\nmust contain all the correct details of the vehicle to be exported,\r\nand the particulars of the person to whom\nit is to be delivered to.\r\nIt must be signed at the border post by the relevant customs\r\nofficial. It is common cause that the CCA1\nforms relevant to the\r\nvarious counts were initially completed by the appellant and later by\r\nGeldenhuys until Wiid stopped him.\n[8] It is common\r\ncause that at some stage during February 1998 the appellant and his\r\nbrother, together with Wiid and Geldenhuys,\nwent on a fishing\r\nexpedition to Namibia. Whilst at Swakopmund they visited Anthony. It\r\nwas during this trip that a bundle of blank\nCCA1 forms were produced\r\nand stamped with a fake Namibian border post stamp made available by\r\nAnthony. Although the appellant denied\nhaving participated in the\r\nstamping of the blank CCA1 forms, Wiid and Geldenhuys insisted that\r\nhe stamped them with Geldenhuys\nand that they returned to South\r\nAfrica with them. These forms were subsequently used to facilitate\r\nthe scheme.\n[9] Riley was the\r\nadministrative clerk at Quattro. She worked closely with Geldenhuys.\r\nHer job entailed receiving vehicles into\nstock, preparing sales\r\ninvoices, maintaining the floor plan and attending to the cash book\r\nand the writing of cheques. She testified\nthat she was aware of the\r\nscheme that involved the purchase and sale of vehicles between Reeds\r\nDelta and Quattro. According to\nher, Auto Haven purchased vehicles\r\nfrom Reeds Delta. Auto Haven would in turn book the vehicles out to\r\nQuattro. The appellant would\nbring the invoices to her so that she\r\ncould receive the vehicles into their stock. Upon receiving the\r\nvehicles she added a certain\namount to the original price. According\r\nto Riley the invoices in respect of these vehicles were addressed to\r\nSirkel Motors in Namibia.\nNotwithstanding this, Auto Haven received\r\nthem into their stock. The invoices would show the commission which\r\nwas payable to the\nappellant. Once the vehicle had been received,\r\nGeldenhuys would issue his personal cheque to pay Reeds Delta. He\r\nwould, in turn,\nissue a cheque for the equivalent amount from\r\nQuattro’s account to repay himself. As Riley was also\r\nresponsible for preparing\ncheques for the commission payable to the\r\nappellant, she would prepare a cheque and give it to Mr Sam Linders,\r\nthe messenger, to\ncash at the bank. Once the cheque was cashed, she\r\nwould hand the money over to Geldenhuys who would give it to the\r\nappellant. She\ntestified that the appellant, from time to time\r\ntelephoned her to check if the money was available and he would then\r\nfetch it.\nImportantly, Riley testified that the appellant knew that\r\nthe vehicles which he had brought to Quattro and which were\r\npurportedly\nexported to Namibia were not exported as he saw them on\r\nthe shop floor at Quattro where he used to visit regularly. Riley\r\nalso\ntestified about an amount of R30 000 which she once had to send\r\nto the appellant in an envelope when the latter was with Wiid at\nthe\r\nCape Town airport. This money represented commission in respect of a\r\nnumber of vehicles which the appellant had delivered to\nQuattro.\n[10] Mr P J Cronje\r\n(Cronje) was an investigator contracted by SARS. To a large extent\r\nhis evidence was not disputed. He was personally\ninvolved in the\r\ninvestigation of this matter. In the course of his investigation he\r\ndiscovered that the CCA1 forms in respect of\nthe vehicles which form\r\nthe subject of the various charges herein had on them a stamp\r\npurporting to be from the Noordoewer border\npost. However, he was\r\nunable to trace the actual stamp. He concluded that the stamp used on\r\nthe forms was not an official one.\nHe also discovered that Geldenhuys\r\nhad in each case completed documents indicating that Quattro had\r\ntaken the relevant vehicles\ninto stock, whereas in the books of Reeds\r\nDelta the invoices were made out to some particular Namibian\r\npurchasers. Furthermore,\nin Quattro’s books the amount\r\nreflected in the relevant invoice in each case was more than the\r\nzero-rated amount actually\ninvoiced and paid to Reeds Delta. On the\r\nother hand, Geldenhuys calculated the deemed VAT on the increased\r\namount reflected on\nthe invoices which he then entered into Quattro’s\r\ndocuments, thus reflecting the vehicle as part of Quattro’s\r\nstock.\n[11] A prominent\r\nfeature in the documents which Cronje handed in consisted of some\r\noffers to purchase and corresponding invoices\nfrom Reeds Delta in\r\nrespect of each vehicle. These documents reflected either Sirkel\r\nMotors or Auto Angling in Windhoek, Namibia,\nas the purchaser. The\r\noffers to purchase in each case were signed by the appellant on\r\nbehalf of the supposed purchasers in Namibia.\nOn both the purchase\r\norder and invoice from Reeds Delta, VAT was shown as zero in each\r\ncase. According to Cronje each CCA1 document\ncontained a Customs and\r\nExcise stamp which was subsequently established to be false. In turn\r\nMr Roy Marcus (Marcus) Reeds Delta’s\nFinancial Director at the\r\ntime, relied on the invoices generated at Reeds Delta and the CCA1\r\nforms to prepare Reeds Delta’s\ntax returns, the so-called VAT\r\n201 forms. Marcus testified that because the information reflected on\r\nthe CCA1 forms corresponded\nwith the one in the schedule of sales in\r\ntheir computer, he believed that the vehicles were indeed exported to\r\nNamibia. Relying\non this information he ensured that Reeds Delta did\r\nnot pay output VAT on these transactions.\n[12] In further\r\npursuit of his investigations, Cronje went to Namibia where he\r\ninterviewed all the dealers who were reflected as\npurchasers on the\r\nReeds Delta invoices and CCA1 forms. All of them indicated that they\r\nhad never purchased, or received, the vehicles\nin question. He\r\nestablished further that these vehicles were instead delivered to\r\nQuattro and Auto Haven in South Africa. Cronje\ndiscovered that no\r\noutput VAT was paid on these transactions when the vehicles were sold\r\nto Quattro and Auto Haven by Reeds Delta.\nThis resulted in Quattro\r\nand Auto Haven unlawfully increasing their profits. Cronje also\r\ndiscovered that the appellant constantly\nreceived commission in\r\nrespect of each of the vehicles he delivered to Quattro. A history of\r\nthese vehicles showed the previous\nowner to be Quattro and not Reeds\r\nDelta. It is worth noting that although the appellant denied\r\nreceiving cash cheques from Geldenhuys\nor Quattro, he admitted that\r\nhe received a small commission for his involvement in these various\r\ntransactions.\n[13] As against the\r\nstate’s version, the appellant denied any participation in any\r\nfraudulent scheme involving the sale of\nvehicles. He admitted that he\r\ndelivered the vehicles in issue to Quattro. He maintained that the\r\nvehicles which Reeds Delta delivered\nto Quattro were intended to be\r\nexported to the Namibian dealers mentioned in the documents. He\r\nconfirmed that he completed the\noffers to purchase in the name of the\r\ndealers in Namibia to whom the vehicles had to be delivered. He knew\r\nthat the tax invoices\nfor these vehicles would show that they were\r\ndestined for export to some specific purchasers in Namibia. This\r\nwould all be used\nas a legal basis for the transactions to be\r\nzero-rated for VAT purposes. He only discovered much later that the\r\nvehicles were never\nexported. The appellant denied ever having\r\nstamped any CCA1 forms whilst on a fishing trip with Wiid and\r\nGeldenhuys in Namibia.\nHe also denied that he received any commission\r\nby way of cheque payments. He maintained that the deals which were\r\nmade between\nReeds Delta and Quattro were legitimate. According to\r\nthe appellant, this arrangement was agreed upon at a meeting where\r\nhis manager,\nMr John Danks (Danks) was present thus implying that\r\nDanks approved it. He testified that he met Wiid at a time when he\r\nwanted\nto expand his market into Namibia. As Wiid complained that he\r\nwas stealing his market after he had contacted Anthony in an attempt\n\nto sell a vehicle to him, they agreed that he would use Quattro as\r\nReeds Delta’s agent. For all intents and purposes he believed\n\nthat the vehicles which he had delivered to Quattro were subsequently\r\nexported to Namibia in accordance with the invoices and CCA1\nforms\r\nwhich he had prepared. He denied having received any commissions as\r\ntestified to by Geldenhuys and Riley and testified that\nhe only\r\nreceived meagre payments for facilitating the sales. He pertinently\r\ndenied that he received R30 000 as commission for the\nsale of\r\nvehicles to Quattro. He conceded that he knew that it was against\r\nReeds Delta’s policy for him to receive any secret\ncommission\r\nfor any work done by him on behalf of Reeds Delta.\n[14] It is common\r\ncause that both Wiid and Geldenhuys testified as accomplices. They\r\nhad already been convicted of charges relating\nto the same scheme\r\nfollowing a plea-bargaining agreement with the state in terms of s\r\n105A of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of\n1977 (CPA). Riley was duly\r\nwarned by the Regional Court Magistrate in terms of s 204 of the CPA\r\nbecause of her role in the scheme.\n[15] Counsel for the\r\nappellant was critical of the magistrate’s acceptance of their\r\nevidence. He submitted that Wiid and Geldenhuys\nwere neither honest\r\nnor truthful witnesses as they tried to minimise their respective\r\nroles in this saga. Regarding Riley it was\nargued that she had been\r\nintimately involved in this elaborate fraud scheme and that she\r\nfailed to testify truthfully and honestly.\nThe main contention is\r\nthat their versions should have been rejected as unreliable.\n[16] Stripped of any\r\nunnecessary frills it appears to me that the only real issue is\r\nwhether and to what extent the appellant had\nknowledge of, and was\r\ninvolved in, this fraudulent scheme. That this was a scheme intended\r\nto defraud SARS of money in respect\nof VAT admits of no doubt. It is\r\nclear from the evidence as a whole that, although the vehicles in\r\nissue were supposed to be exported\nto Namibia and thus qualified to\r\nbe zero-rated, they were never exported to the purchasers identified\r\nin the relevant documents\nin Namibia. Instead, they were delivered to\r\nAuto Haven or Quattro where they were taken into their stock.\r\nContrary to the invoices\nand offers to purchase, the vehicles were\r\nthen sold locally. It is also common cause that false CCA1 forms were\r\nused to facilitate\nthis fraudulent scheme. This is confirmed by Mr\r\nVuzo Ngcobo (Ngcobo) who was the Branch Manager at Vioolsdrift border\r\npost. Mr\nEdwin van Rooy (Van Rooy), who was a Senior Customs Officer\r\nin Namibia, testified that for a proper import of vehicles into\r\nNamibia\nfrom South Africa, a CCA1 form had to be submitted together\r\nwith a NA500 form from Namibia which has been in use since 1 June\r\n1995.\nHe stated further that the stamp of Noordoewer 061 which was\r\nused on the CCA1 forms was false and did not emanate from their\r\noffices.\nThis is so as the Namibian authorities did not use\r\nNoordoewer 061 but Noordoewer 06I, the ‘I’ standing for\r\n‘import.’\nImportantly Van Rooy confirmed that the\r\nvehicles involved herein could not be found either in the computers\r\nat Noordoewer border\npost or their main computer at their head\r\noffice. This is crucial as all vehicles imported from South Africa or\r\nanywhere outside\nNamibia have to be registered on their computer for\r\npurposes of registration.\n[17] It was argued\r\non behalf of the appellant that the evidence of Wiid and Geldenhuys\r\nshould have been rejected as unreliable.\nThe main argument is that\r\ntheir versions were littered with serious contradictions and further\r\nthat they did not testify truthfully\nand honestly, in particular\r\nabout their involvement in the scheme. It is clear that the trial\r\ncourt was aware of the contradictions\nin the versions of both Wiid\r\nand Geldenhuys. Having observed the two witnesses whilst testifying,\r\nthe trial court acknowledged\nthat it could not be said that they were\r\nperfect witnesses. However, the trial court, despite some\r\nimperfections in their evidence\nand having applied the necessary\r\ncaution, found that their evidence was the truth, more so that it was\r\namply corroborated by other\nevidence, including circumstantial\r\nevidence. It is not required of accomplices that they be perfect\r\nwitnesses. In\nS v Francis\n1991(1)\r\nSACR 198 (A) at 205f-g, this court set out the position thus:\n‘\nIt is\r\nnot necessarily expected of an accomplice, before his evidence can be\r\naccepted, that he should be wholly consistent and wholly\nreliable, or\r\neven wholly truthful, in all that he says. The ultimate test is\r\nwhether, after due consideration of the accomplice’s\nevidence\r\nwith the caution which the law enjoins, the Court is satisfied beyond\r\nall reasonable doubt that in its essential features\nthe story that he\r\ntells is a true one.’\n[18] Having read the\r\ntranscript I am unable to find any fault with the assessment of these\r\nwitnesses by the trial court, which had\nthe advantage of seeing them\r\ntestify and observing their reactions to questions during\r\ncross-examination. This gave the trial court\nan advantage which this\r\ncourt does not have as a court of appeal. In the absence of any\r\nmisdirection by the trial court, I decline\nto interfere with such a\r\nfinding. See\nR v Dhlumayo & another\n1948 (2) SA 677\n(A);\nS v Francis\n,\r\nabove at 204c-e\n[19] Central to the\r\nresolution of this appeal is the interpretation of s 11(1)(a) of the\r\nValue-Added Tax Act 89 of 1991 (the VAT\nAct) which provides:\n‘\nZero\r\nrating\n(1) Where, but for this section,\r\na supply of goods would be charged with tax at the rate referred to\r\nin section 7 (1), such supply\nof goods shall, subject to compliance\r\nwith subsection (3) of this section, be charged with tax at the rate\r\nof zero per cent where\n–\n(a) the supplier has supplied the\r\ngoods (being movable goods) in terms of a sale or instalment credit\r\nagreement and –\n(i) the supplier has exported the\r\ngoods in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)\r\nof the definition of ‘exported’\nin section (1); or\n(ii) the goods have been exported\r\nby the recipient and the supplier has elected to supply the goods at\r\nthe zero rate as contemplated\nin Part 2 of an export incentive scheme\r\nreferred to in paragraph (d) of the definition of ‘exported’\r\nin section 1:\nProvided that –\n(aa) where a supplier has\r\nsupplied the goods to the recipient in the Republic otherwise than in\r\nterms of this subparagraph, such\nsupply shall not be charged with tax\r\nat the rate of zero per cent; and\n(bb) where the goods have been\r\nremoved from the Republic by the recipient in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of an export incentive\nscheme referred to in paragraph (d)\r\nof the definition of ‘exported’ in section 1, such tax\r\nshall be refunded to the\nrecipient in accordance with the provisions\r\nof section 44 (9).’\n[20] Section 7(1)(a)\r\nprovides that ‘there shall be levied and paid for the benefit\r\nof the National Revenue Fund a tax, to\nbe known as the value-added\r\ntax – (a) on the supply by any vendor of goods or services\r\nsupplied by him on or after the commencement\ndate in the course or\r\nfurtherance of any enterprise carried on by him’. Equally\r\nrelevant is s 28(1), which prescribes that\nany vendor shall, within\r\nthe period ending on the twenty-fifth of the first month commencing\r\nafter the end of a tax period relating\nto such vendor, furnish the\r\nCommissioner with a return and calculate the amount of such tax\r\naccordingly and pay the tax payable\nto the Commissioner. Section\r\n16(3)(a)(i) prescribes how the amount of the tax payable should be\r\ncalculated by deducting the ‘output\ntax’ from the ‘input\r\ntax’.\n[21] It is common\r\ncause that Reeds Delta, as a registered vendor, had the legal\r\nobligation to comply with the provisions of the\nVAT Act. As a\r\nregistered vendor it was obliged to pay ‘output tax’ in\r\nrespect of all vehicles it sold in South Africa.\nIt was only when it\r\nsold its vehicles outside the country ie exported them, that it was\r\nexempted from paying ‘output tax’\nin terms of s 11(1)(a)\r\nof the VAT Act. In other words it would be entitled to charge tax on\r\nthe vehicles at the rate of zero per\ncent.\n[22] It is clear\r\nfrom a reading of the VAT Act that it is essentially a system of\r\nself-assessment, in that the responsibility to\ncalculate, deduct and\r\npay over the correct value-added tax lies solely with the vendor.\r\nInvariably, SARS is bound to rely on the\nhonesty and integrity of\r\nvendors to calculate and pay the correct amount for VAT. It will not\r\nbe feasible or cost-effective for\nSARS on its own to try and verify\r\neach and every transaction by each and every vendor. It is therefore\r\nof critical importance that\nall relevant documentation be properly\r\ncompleted.\n[23] Counsel for the\r\nappellant submitted that no fraud has been proved in this case. The\r\nthrust of his submission was that, even\naccepting that the vehicles\r\nconcerned were not delivered to the purchasers shown in the invoices\r\nand CCA1 forms, which were prepared\nby the appellant, there was\r\nevidence that some of the vehicles were ultimately sold and delivered\r\nto certain purchasers in Namibia.\nBased on this, he contended that\r\nthe appellant was entitled to sell those vehicles at zero-rated VAT.\r\nHe submitted that what was\nessential for compliance with s 11(1)(a)\r\nwas that the vehicles were ultimately exported to Namibia. He\r\ncontended that it was irrelevant\nas to when or to whom they were\r\nexported. He argued further that by having the vehicles eventually\r\nexported to Namibia, albeit\nto different purchasers and at dates\r\ndifferent to those reflected on the invoices and CCA1 forms, the\r\nappellant did not cause SARS\nto suffer any prejudice, be it actual or\r\npotential and hence no fraud was proved.\n[24] On the other\r\nhand, counsel for the respondent submitted that s 11(1)(a) requires\r\nstrict compliance. This is so because the\nCCA1 forms and the tax\r\ninvoices are intended to serve as essential proof that the goods\r\nreflected on them have in fact left South\nAfrica for export to\r\nanother country, this being the basis for a legitimate reason for the\r\nzero-rated VAT. Counsel submitted that\nfor the appellant to have\r\ncomplied with the section, he had to ensure that the vehicles which\r\nwere recorded in the offers to purchase,\ninvoices and CCA1 forms were\r\nindeed taken over the South African border and sold and delivered to\r\nthe purchasers in Namibia as\nreflected on the forms. She contended\r\nfurther that the fact that some of the vehicles which were delivered\r\nto Quattro by the appellant\nwere subsequently exported to Namibia by\r\nQuattro and delivered to purchasers different to those reflected in\r\nthe forms was not\nsufficient to purge these transactions of their\r\nillegality. Counsel’s contention was that the evidence\r\ndemonstrated clearly\nthat the scheme between the appellant, Wiid and\r\nGeldenhuys was that the appellant sold the vehicles to Wiid at\r\nzero-rated VAT on\nthe pretext that the vehicles were destined for\r\nexport to specific customers in Namibia. She submitted that all three\r\nof them knew\nthat the vehicles were not to be exported but would be\r\nsold by Quattro locally. This is further bolstered by the admitted\r\nfact\nthat it is Geldenhuys and not Namibian purchasers who paid Reeds\r\nDelta for the vehicles sold. She submitted that the fact that Reeds\n\nDelta unlawfully avoided paying ‘output VAT’ in respect\r\nof vehicles which were never exported constituted actual prejudice\nto\r\nSARS.\n[25] The appellant’s\r\nmain submission raises the rather philosophical question of when is\r\nfraud a real fraud. Does the mere\nfact that some of the vehicles sold\r\nby Reeds Delta to Quattro were ultimately sold by Quattro to\r\ndifferent purchasers in Namibia\npurge these transactions of their\r\nillegality? I think not. The appellant did not dispute the fact that,\r\nwhilst employed by Reeds\nDelta, he sent vehicles from Reeds Delta to\r\nQuattro which were accompanied by offers to purchase, tax invoices\r\nand CCA1 forms,\nall of which reflected that the vehicles were\r\ndestined for export to identified purchasers in Namibia. However,\r\ncontrary to what\nwas contained in these documents, the state has\r\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt, in my view, that the vehicles in\r\nissue were in\nfact never exported to the named purchasers in Namibia.\r\nInstead, they were delivered to Quattro which in turn took them into\r\nits\nstock and sold most of them locally. There is also uncontradicted\r\nevidence that the CCA1 forms used in these transactions were false.\n\nThe appellant admitted to facilitating these sales, for which Quattro\r\nwould pay him a small commission. I accordingly find the\nsubmission\r\nby appellant’s counsel to be without merit.\n[26] The word\r\n‘export’ in terms of the general scheme of the VAT Act\r\nhas a special meaning. In terms of the VAT Act\n‘exported’,\r\nin relation to any movable goods supplied by any vendor under a sale\r\nor an instalment credit agreement\nmeans amongst others–\n‘\n(a)\r\nconsigned or delivered by the vendor to the recipient at an address\r\nin an export country as evidenced by documentary proof acceptable\nto\r\nthe Commissioner….’\nIt is clear from the\r\nevidence that the vehicles which appeared on the invoices and CCA1\r\nforms from Reeds Delta were never delivered\nto the recipients at the\r\naddresses in Namibia reflected on the invoices and CCA1 forms and\r\nwere not intended to be delivered to\nthem. Undoubtedly, the appellant\r\nacted in contravention of the VAT Act.\n[27] In his book,\r\nthe\nSouth African Criminal Law and Procedure\n3ed (1996) Vol.\r\nII at p702, JRL Milton defines fraud as the unlawful making, with\r\nintent to defraud of a misrepresentation which\ncauses actual\r\nprejudice or which is potentially prejudicial to another. The\r\nessential elements of fraud are therefore (a) unlawfully;\n(b) making\r\na misrepresentation; (c) causing; (d) prejudice or potential\r\nprejudice; (e) intent to defraud (at p707). It is clear\nfrom the\r\nevidence that by pretending that the vehicles concerned were destined\r\nfor export to certain specified purchasers in Namibia\nwhen in truth\r\nthey were sold locally the appellant misrepresented the facts. The\r\nfact that the appellant knowingly falsified the\noffers to purchase\r\nand the tax invoices and used false CCA1 forms is clear proof that\r\nthe appellant acted unlawfully and with clear\nintent to defraud. It\r\nis common cause that the appellant is an experienced seller of\r\nvehicles. Importantly, he conceded that he\nknew what the correct\r\nprocedures and legal requirements for exports of vehicles were as, on\r\nhis own admission, he had been exporting\nvehicles to Namibia prior to\r\nhis involvement with Wiid and Geldenhuys. Evidently, the appellant’s\r\nconduct resulted in SARS\nlosing approximately R1,6 million in respect\r\nof the output VAT which Reeds Delta should have paid in respect of\r\nthe vehicles as\nthey were not exported but sold locally. To my mind,\r\nthe appellant’s conduct meets the definition of fraud. The fact\r\nthat\nthe appellant consistently received payments from Quattro, no\r\nmatter how big or small, for these fraudulent transactions,\r\nconstitutes\nproof that he was a willing participant in this elaborate\r\nfraudulent scheme. It follows that his convictions for fraud on all\r\nthe\n157 counts were correct and must stand.\n[28] I now proceed\r\nto deal with the appeal against the sentences imposed. The main\r\nsubmission advanced on the appellant’s\nbehalf was that the\r\nsentences imposed on him are startlingly disparate to the sentences\r\nimposed on Wiid and Geldenhuys, his former\nco-accused who were both\r\nconvicted on all the counts of fraud following their plea-bargains\r\nwith the respondent. It was submitted\nthat a comparison of the\r\nrespective sentences induces a sense of shock. Great emphasis was\r\nplaced on the principle of parity ie\nthat people who commit the same\r\noffence(s) must, absent compelling reasons, be sentenced alike. It\r\nwas submitted that the fact\nthat both Wiid and Geldenhuys pleaded\r\nguilty to all the charges in terms of s 105A of the CPA cannot\r\njustify such disturbing disparities\nin their sentences. I do not\r\nagree.\n[29] There are two\r\nimportant factors which distinguish the two scenarios. First, the\r\nappellant’s two former co-accused entered\ninto a\r\nplea-bargaining agreement with the state in terms of s 105A of CPA\r\nand were sentenced in accordance therewith. Secondly,\nand quite\r\nimportantly because of the fact that the appellant pleaded not guilty\r\nwith the result that evidence was led against him,\nthe trial court\r\nhad sufficient evidence about how the frauds were carefully planned\r\nand executed, including the crucial role played\nby the appellant. To\r\nmy mind, the trial court was justified in taking such evidence into\r\naccount in deciding on an appropriate\nsentence for the appellant.\r\nThis is so as each court had a discretion to decide on an appropriate\r\nsentence based on the facts adduced\nbefore each court. It is trite\r\nthat sentencing is pre-eminently a matter falling within the\r\ndiscretion of the sentencing court.\nAccordingly, I fail to see how,\r\nassuming the sentences imposed on the appellant’s erstwhile\r\nco-accused were unduly lenient,\nthe appellant could be entitled to\r\nbenefit from any such alleged undue leniency committed by the court\r\nwhich sentenced them. Such\nan approach to sentencing would lead to a\r\ntravesty of the principles underlying sentencing.\n[30] I am not\r\npersuaded that the sentences imposed on the appellant, given the\r\nscale and circumstances under which these offences\nwere committed,\r\nare shockingly inappropriate. It is clear from the evidence that this\r\nelaborate fraudulent scheme was well thought\nout and planned. The\r\nscheme was executed from October 1997 to December 1998. In the\r\nprocess 157 vehicles were fraudulently sold\nwithout any ‘output\r\nVAT’ being paid. This resulted in SARS being defrauded of\r\napproximately R1,6 million. The evidence\nproves clearly that the\r\nappellant played a pivotal role in this scheme. He prepared the false\r\noffers to purchase, which were used\nto generate false tax invoices as\r\nwell as the CCA1 forms. All these documents were indispensable to the\r\nsuccess of the fraud. And\nfor every fraudulent transaction, the\r\nappellant benefited unlawfully by receiving a commission from\r\nQuattro. This is notwithstanding\nthe fact that in terms of his\r\ncontract with his employer, Reeds Delta, he was not supposed to\r\nreceive any remuneration or commission\nprivately. It is clear that\r\nthe appellant was motivated by nothing other than greed and\r\nself-aggrandisement. He unashamedly abused\nthe position of trust in\r\nwhich he stood vis-à-vis his employer.\n[31] I agree that\r\nthere is a need to impose appropriate sentences with a deterrent\r\neffect, particularly in matters involving fraud\nwhich is so endemic\r\nin our society. However, I am of the view that the court below did\r\nnot give proper consideration to the cumulative\neffect of the\r\nsentences imposed on the appellant. What is clear is that the various\r\ncounts of fraud and the one of corruption all\nemanate from the same\r\ntransactions. I regard it as fair that the sentences be ordered to\r\nrun concurrently to ameliorate the severity\nthereof.\n[32] In the result I\r\nmake the following order–\n1. The appeal\r\nagainst conviction on the 157 counts of fraud is dismissed.\n2. The sentences\r\nimposed on the appellant in respect of the counts of fraud and one of\r\ncorruption are confirmed, but it is ordered\nthat the sentence imposed\r\nin respect of 157 counts of fraud run concurrently with the sentence\r\nimposed in respect of the corruption\ncharges.\n______________\nL O Bosielo\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES:\nAPPELLANT: D A J\r\nUijs SC\nInstructed by:\nCraig Schneider &\r\nAssociates, Stellenbosch;\nMcIntyre & Van\r\nder Post, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT: B Hendry\nInstructed by:\nDirector Public\r\nProsecutions, Cape Town;\nDirector Public\r\nProsecutions, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, a sales manager at Reeds Motors, colluded with Ian Wiid, the owner of two Namibian‑linked motor dealerships, and Frederick Geldenhuys, their manager, to disguise domestic sales of vehicles as exports to Namibia. He prepared offers to purchase, invoices and CCA1 customs forms that showed the vehicles were to be exported and thus zero‑rated for VAT. In reality the vehicles were delivered to Quattro and Auto Haven in South Africa, sold locally and the false CCA1 forms were stamped with a counterfeit Namibia border stamp. The appellant received commissions for each transaction, although he initially denied doing so. The scheme resulted in an estimated loss of R1.6 million in output VAT to SARS. The co‑accused Wiid and Geldenhuys were convicted as accomplices; the appellant was convicted on 157 counts of fraud and one count of corruption.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the appellant knowingly participated in a scheme that falsified export documentation to obtain zero‑rated VAT, thereby committing fraud under the VAT Act. 2. Whether the accomplice testimony of Wiid and Geldenhuys was admissible despite inconsistencies. 3. Whether the conviction and sentence should be upheld in light of the alleged disparity with co‑accused who pleaded guilty.",
    "principles": "The Court applied s 11(1)(a) of the VAT Act, requiring strict compliance with export documentation (CCA1 forms) for a supply to be zero‑rated. It relied on the definition of \"export\" and the necessity of genuine documentary proof. The Court also applied the definition of fraud from J.R.L. Milton (unlawful misrepresentation causing prejudice with intent to defraud). Regarding accomplice evidence, the Court reiterated the principle from S v Francis that an accomplice need not be a perfect witness; credibility is assessed with caution and corroboration.",
    "application": "The Court found that the appellant prepared false offers, invoices and CCA1 forms, was aware that the vehicles never left South Africa, and received commissions for the fraudulent sales. The false CCA1 stamps were corroborated by customs testimony. The accomplice evidence of Wiid and Geldenhuys, though not flawless, was corroborated by documentary and circumstantial evidence, satisfying the standard set in S v Francis. Consequently, the fraud was proven beyond reasonable doubt. Regarding sentencing, the Court noted the appellant’s refusal to plead guilty, his central role in planning and executing the scheme, and the plea‑bargains of the co‑accused, justifying a harsher sentence consistent with judicial discretion.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal against the conviction on the 157 counts of fraud was dismissed. The sentences for the fraud counts and the corruption count were confirmed, with the fraud sentence ordered to run concurrently with the corruption sentence."
