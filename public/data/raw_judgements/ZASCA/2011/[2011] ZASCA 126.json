    "facts": "The appellant (Emergency Care Training Association) appealed a decision of the North Gauteng High Court (Pretoria). The respondents had provided undertakings in an answering affidavit that rendered the relief sought by the appellant unnecessary, making any further adjudication moot.",
    "issues": "Whether the Court of Appeal should hear the appeal when the respondents' undertakings obviate the need for any further relief, and whether dismissing the appeal would have any practical effect.",
    "principles": "The Court exercised its discretion under section 21A of the Supreme Court Act, 59 of 1959, which permits dismissal of an appeal where no practical effect would result from a decision. The principle is that courts should not waste resources deciding issues that have become moot.",
    "application": "Applying the above principle, the Court found that the respondents' undertakings removed the necessity for the appellant's sought relief. Consequently, any decision on the appealed issues would not change the factual or legal position, justifying dismissal of the appeal.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The appellant was ordered to pay the respondents' costs, including the costs of two counsel."
