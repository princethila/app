The court below (Ranchod J) dismissed the\r\napplication. Bryntirion, with the leave\nof the court below, appeals\r\nto this court against the dismissal of the application.\n[2]\tDuring September\r\n2005, the Department of Public Works (the department) approached\r\nBryntirion with an offer to purchase the property.\nThe letter\r\nrecording the offer stated the reason for the intended purchase as\r\nfollows:\n‘\nThe intention to purchase your\r\nproperty has been informed by the fact that all properties within the\r\nestate boundaries are government\nowned except for the one land parcel\r\nviz. Erf 16 Bryntirion which is owned by your company Erf 16\r\nBryntirion Pty LTD.\nAs the government is intending to\r\nupgrade the estate, your property is situated on the main entrance to\r\nthe Bryntirion estate and\nif not purchased will have a detrimental\r\nimpact on the security planning for the estate as a whole.’\nBryntirion, through its\r\nattorneys, advised the department that it had no intention of selling\r\nthe property. On 22 September 2005,\nthe department again addressed a\r\nletter to Bryntirion, asking it to reconsider its position and\r\nrequesting a meeting of the parties\nin order to discuss the reasons\r\nfor the proposed acquisition of the property by the department.\r\nBryntirion did not take the department\nup on this suggestion.\n[3]\tDuring October 2005,\r\nnotice was given to Bryntirion of the intention of the City of\r\nTshwane Metropolitan Municipality to close\nNassau Street (a street\r\nrunning through Bryntirion Estate) and to consolidate a number of\r\nerven and the internal road network to\nform the Bryntirion\r\nPresidential Estate. In terms of a letter dated 26 January 2006, the\r\ndepartment advised Bryntirion that it\nhad 21 days to make\r\nrepresentations and be heard before the property was ‘finally\r\nexpropriated’. On 8 February 2006,\nBryntirion advised the\r\ndepartment that it intended to object to the expropriation and\r\nrequested certain information to enable it\nto make representations.\r\nAfter initially agreeing to furnish the information requested by\r\nBryntirion, the Minister, by letter dated\n4 August 2006, advised\r\nBryntirion that its request for information was premature in that a\r\ndecision had not yet been made to expropriate\nthe property. In the\r\nsame letter, the Minister set out the purpose of the intended\r\nexpropriation:\n‘\nYou are well aware that the\r\nproperty … lies within the proximity of the residential\r\ncomplex for Senior Government Officials\nincluding Ministers. The\r\nGovernment intends to upgrade the estate with a view to, amongst\r\nothers, enhancing the security planning\nfor the estate as a whole.\r\nThe property to be acquired in giving effect to this objective will\r\nbe so acquired for public purpose\nand in the public interest.\n…\nYou are therefore granted an\r\nopportunity in terms of Section 3 of PAJA to respond in writing to\r\nour Department as to why your property\nshould not be acquired for\r\npublic purposes and in the public interest.\nKindly send your representations\r\nwithin 14 days from the date of receipt of this letter to our\r\nDepartment.’\n[4]\tIn terms of a letter\r\ndated 13 September 2006, Bryntirion’s attorneys repeated their\r\nrequest for certain information in\norder to enable Bryntirion to make\r\nrepresentations and further stated that there appeared to be a\r\ncontradiction as to whether or\nnot a decision had already been taken\r\nto expropriate the property. The department, in its response dated 10\r\nOctober 2007, set out\nthe reasons for the intended expropriation in\r\nthe following terms:\n‘\n1. \tYour client’s\r\nproperty is the only private property within the Bryntirion Estate;\n2. \tThe positioning of your client’s\r\nproperty on the estate makes it impossible to cordon off the entire\r\nestate for effective\nsecurity measures; and\n3. \tThe Government intends to upgrade\r\nthe estate with a view to, amongst others, enhancing the security\r\nplanning for the estate\nas a whole.’\nThe letter proceeded to\r\nfurnish answers to some of the questions posed while withholding\r\ninformation which, in the view of the department,\nwould compromise\r\nmatters of security. Information was withheld in relation to, inter\r\nalia, the plans to upgrade the Estate, alternative\nentrances to the\r\nEstate and the fate of the property after expropriation. Bryntirion\r\nwas also called upon to file representations,\nif any, within seven\r\ndays of receipt of the letter.\n[5]\tBy letter dated 2\r\nNovember 2006, Bryntirion’s attorneys set out ‘preliminary\r\nrepresentations’ as to why the\nproperty should not be\r\nexpropriated. These included:\n‘\nThe expropriation is not in the\r\npublic interest or for a public purpose.\nThe expropriation is not urgent.\nNo proper and rational consideration\r\nhas been given to the alternatives to expropriation.\nThe Bryntirion Estate can be\r\nconstituted without inclusion of our client’s property, and our\r\nclient’s property can therefore\nnot be said to be the only\r\nprivate dwelling within the estate.\nSecurity will not be more effective or\r\nbetter managed by inclusion of our client’s property in the\r\nestate.\n…\nThe consolidated plan of the proposed\r\nconsolidated erf in Bryntirion Presidential Estate as prepared by\r\nMetroplan excludes our client’s\nproperty as part of the\r\nconsolidated erf.\n…\nOur client has occupied the property\r\nfor ten years with the State as his neighbour on all sides, except on\r\nthe street front with\nDumbarton Road. Our client’s presence has\r\nat no previous time been suggested to constitute a security risk or\r\nan impediment\nto the effective security of the adjoining properties\r\noccupied by Government officials.\nNo real threat to the security of\r\nresidents of Bryntirion Estate which is any greater than the security\r\nrisk to residents in the\nadjoining residential areas in Pretoria has\r\nmanifested and which reasonably requires Government Ministers and\r\nofficials to be segregated\nin a security estate from persons resident\r\nin the adjoining areas.’\n[6]\tOn 13 February 2007,\r\nthe Minister advised Bryntirion, in writing, that she was required to\r\nmake a decision regarding the proposed\nexpropriation of the property.\r\nRelevant portions of her letter state:\n‘\nPurpose of Expropriation\n2.1 \tThe property in respect of which\r\nI have to make the aforementioned decision, is required for inclusion\r\ninto the Government\nresidential complex for members of Cabinet. It is\r\nthe only property within the complex under private ownership.\n2.2 \tThe acquisition of the property\r\nis intended to effect adequate security measures within the complex.\n3 \tUpon expropriation, the property\r\nwill form part of the Government complex to which it is presently\r\nimmediately adjacent.\n4\tYou will be entitled to compensation\r\nin respect of the property to be expropriated.\n...\n5.3\tYou are hereby afforded the\r\nopportunity to comment, in writing, within 21 days of delivery of\r\nthis letter to you ….’\n[7]\tOn 13 March 2007,\r\nBryntirion’s attorneys made representations as to why the\r\nproperty should not be expropriated. These\nrepresentations were\r\nsubstantially similar to the representations made on 2 November 2006,\r\nset out in para 5 above. There was further\ncorrespondence between the\r\nparties around the issue of expropriation of the property. On 3\r\nJanuary 2008, the Minister signed a\nnotice of expropriation which was\r\ndelivered to Bryntirion on 7 January 2008. Compensation in the amount\r\nof R7 620 800 was offered\nto Bryntirion.\n[8]\tBryntirion instituted\r\nreview proceedings on 27 February 2008 in terms of Uniform Rule 53.\r\nOn 12 August 2008, the Minister delivered\na record of what she had\r\nconsidered before she took the decision to expropriate the property.\r\nIt was common cause that the documents\nthat were placed before the\r\nMinister to enable her to make a decision regarding the property\r\nconsisted of legal opinions, correspondence\nbetween the department\r\nand Bryntirion’s attorneys and consultants’ reports. The\r\nMinister did not include the legal\nopinions in the record on the\r\ngrounds that they were privileged and included only an edited version\r\nof a consultant’s report\ntitled ‘Department of Public\r\nWorks, Bryntirion Estate Preliminary Design Report on the Security\r\nElectronic Systems’\n(the Bryntirion Report). The Minister\r\nrefused to make full disclosure of the Bryntirion Report on the\r\ngrounds of state security.\nPursuant to the Minister’s refusal\r\nto make available the three legal opinions and the full Bryntirion\r\nReport, Bryntirion\napplied to court, in terms of Uniform Rule 30A,\r\nfor an order directing her to deliver these documents. This\r\napplication was dismissed\nby the high court (Seriti J) on 17 June\r\n2009.\n[9]\tSection 2 of the\r\nExpropriation Act 63 of 1975 empowers the Minister to expropriate any\r\nproperty for ‘public purposes’\nsubject to the obligation\r\nto pay compensation.  For present purposes, the requirements for a\r\nvalid expropriation are that it must\nbe for a ‘public purpose’,\r\ncomply with the procedural requirements set out in the Expropriation\r\nAct, be the product\nof a\nbona fide\nexercise of discretion and\r\nnot arbitrary or irrational and it must not be for an ulterior\r\npurpose.\n1\n[10]\tBryntirion argued\r\nthat the decision to expropriate was irrational.  In order to\r\nsucceed, it must demonstrate that the decision\nserved ‘no\r\nlegitimate governmental purpose’.\n2\nThere is, in my view, no basis upon which it could be found that the\r\ndecision to expropriate was irrational.  The evidence clearly\n\ndemonstrates that the expropriation had a rational purpose relating\r\nto legitimate security concerns.  It has been held that expropriation\n\nof land bordering on the official residence of the Prime Minister in\r\norder to obtain a greater measure of security and privacy\nfor him is\r\nan expropriation for ‘public purposes’.\n3\nThe expropriation in the present case was clearly for ‘public\r\npurposes’.  In fact, it was not contended otherwise\nby\r\nBryntirion.\n[11]\tIt was argued that\r\nthe decision of the Minister in expropriating the property was taken\r\nbecause irrelevant considerations were\ntaken into account and\r\nrelevant considerations were not considered. It was further\r\ncontended, in support of this argument, that\nincorrect facts\r\nregarding the new entrance to the proposed Estate, were placed before\r\nthe Minister. The Minister, in her answering\naffidavit, said the\r\nfollowing about the new entrance:\n‘\n21.2 The fact that it might be\r\npossible to construct a perimeter fence or wall around the Bryntirion\r\nestate without including the\nproperty does not address the security\r\nconcerns that would be created thereby. It is clear from the\r\ncorrespondence from Delport\nDu Preez & Associates dated 24\r\nOctober 2005, which forms part of the record, that the inability to\r\ncordon off the entire estate\nwill raise a number of security issues\r\nincluding:\n21.2.1\tIn accordance with the new\r\nproposed master plan for the Bryntirion estate, the new main entrance\r\nfor vehicles and pedestrians\nwill be in Colroyn Road and all traffic\r\nwill have to pass the Applicant’s property to reach the\r\nentrance or leave the estate;\n...’.\nThe allegation by the\r\nMinister that the new main entrance would be in Colroyn Road was\r\nclearly based on incorrect facts having been\nplaced before her. In\r\nany event, the main reason for the expropriation of the property was\r\nthat it could fall within the Estate\nso that security concerns could\r\nbe effectively addressed. The fact that the Minister may have been\r\ngiven incorrect information\nas to where the main entrance to the\r\nEstate would be situated is irrelevant.\n[12]\tIt\r\nwas common cause that the Minister’s decision to expropriate\r\nthe property was\n‘\nadministrative\r\naction’ as defined in s 1 of the Promotion of Administrative\r\nJustice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA) and which materially\nand adversely\r\naffected Bryntirion’s rights. Administrative action which\r\nmaterially and adversely affects the rights or legitimate\n\nexpectations of any person must be procedurally fair.\n4\nIn order to give effect to the right to procedurally fair\r\nadministrative action, an administrator must, inter alia, give the\r\naffected\nperson notice of the nature and purpose of the proposed\r\nadministrative action and an opportunity to make representations.\n5\nFair administrative procedure depends on the circumstances of each\r\ncase.\n6\nAdequate notice includes the duty to provide the affected person\r\nwith the essential information which motivates the impending\naction,\r\nand must indicate what the main considerations for the contemplated\r\naction are in order to enable the affected person to\nprepare a\r\nresponse.\n7\n[13]\tIt was contended\r\nthat Bryntirion was not given sufficient information in order to make\r\nmeaningful representations as to why\nthe property should not be\r\nexpropriated.  It was further contended that Bryntirion was not given\r\nadequate notice of the nature\nand purpose of the proposed\r\nadministrative action, nor was it given a reasonable opportunity to\r\nmake representations in regard\nto the proposed expropriation. The\r\neffect of this, so the argument went, was to render the expropriation\r\nprocess procedurally unfair.\n[14]\tFrom the very first\r\ncommunication to Bryntirion, and consistently thereafter, it was\r\nadvised that the ultimate purpose of the\nexpropriation was to make\r\nthe Bryntirion Estate a single geographic unit. Bryntirion was told\r\nthat the property was the only privately\nowned property within the\r\nEstate, that the government intended cordoning off the entire Estate\r\nin order to enhance security and\nthat this could only effectively be\r\nachieved if the property was to form part of the Estate. This was set\r\nout in the various communications\nreferred to in paras 2, 3, 4 and 6\r\nabove. Bryntirion was left in no doubt that the reason for the\r\nexpropriation related to the\nestablishment of a secure estate.\r\nBryntirion was invited to make representations on four occasions.\r\nRepresentations were in fact\nmade on two occasions. It is clear from\r\nthe representations made by Bryntirion that it had been given\r\nsufficient information regarding\nthe underlying reasons for and the\r\npurpose of the expropriation. Bryntirion has never been in any doubt\r\nabout the reasons for the\nexpropriation. It did not need to know\r\nprecisely what measures would  be taken. In these circumstances, it\r\ncannot be said that\nthe procedure adopted was unfair.\n[15]\tThe high watermark\r\nof Bryntirion's case was that the security concerns could be met\r\nwithout the expropriation. It had suggested,\ninter alia, that a\r\nperimeter fence could quite easily be erected around the Estate\r\nwithout including the property in the new security\nperimeter. It was\r\nalso argued that the security concerns raised by the Minister with\r\nregard to the property could be raised against\nall the residences on\r\nthe western side of Dumbarton Road.\n[16]\tIt is for the\r\nexpropriating authority to decide how best to achieve its purpose.\n8\nThe evaluation of whether an expropriation is expedient or necessary\r\nlies with the expropriating authority.\n9\nThe fact that there are other ways to achieve the purposes of the\r\nexpropriation is irrelevant provided that the expropriation is\nfor a\r\n‘public purpose’.\n10\n[17]\tThe appeal is\r\ndismissed with costs, including costs of two counsel where so\r\nemployed.\n____________\nL V THERON\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances:\nAppellant:\t\t\tN G D Maritz SC\nInstructed by Michelle Horn Attorneys,\r\nPretoria\nNaudés Attorneys, Bloemfontein\nRespondent:\tM Sikhakhane\nInstructed by State Attorney, Pretoria\nState Attorney, Bloemfontein\n1\nBroadway Mansions (Pty) Ltd v\r\n\tPretoria City Council\n1955\r\n\t(1) SA 517\n(A) at 522B-D.\nPharmaceutical\nManufacturers Association of\r\n\tSA & another\n:\nIn\r\n\tre Ex Parte President of the RSA & others\n[2000] ZACC 1\n;\n2000\r\n\t(2) SA 674\n(CC).\n2\nPharmaceutical\nManufacturers Association of\r\n\tSA & another\n:\nIn\r\n\tre Ex Parte President of the RSA & others\n[2000] ZACC 1\n;\n2000\r\n\t(2) SA 674\n(CC) para 24.\n3\nSlabbert v Minister Van Lande\n1963 (3) SA 620\n(T).\n4\nSection 3(1) of PAJA.\n5\nSection 3(2)\n(b)\nof PAJA.\n6\nDu Preez & another v Truth and\r\n\tReconcilation Commission\n[1997] ZASCA 2\n;\n1997 (3) SA 204\n(A) at 231G-232E;\nNortje\r\n\t& ‘n ander v Minister van Korrektiewe Dienste\n2001 (3) SA 472\n(SCA) para 17.\n7\nDu Preez\nat 234I.\n8\nWhite Rocks Farm (Pty) Ltd &\r\n\tothers v Minister of Community Development\n1984\r\n\t(3) SA 785\n(N) at 792.\n9\nOffit Enterprises (Pty) Ltd &\r\n\tanother v Coega Development Corporation (Pty) Limited & others\n2010 (4) SA 242\n(SCA) para 48 fn 24.\n10\nFourie v Minister van Lande\n1970 (4) SA 165\n(O) at 169D-E and\r\n\t176F-G.

    "facts": "The Department of Public Works approached Erf 16 Bryntirion (Pty) Ltd (Bryntirion) in September 2005 with an offer to purchase its property, which Bryntirion declined. Subsequently the Department indicated its intention to expropriate the property to upgrade the Bryntirion Estate for security purposes, issuing several letters between 2005 and 2007 outlining the rationale and inviting representations. On 3 January 2008 the Minister of Public Works issued a notice of expropriation, offering compensation of R7,620,800. Bryntirion challenged the decision, arguing that the expropriation was irrational, not a public purpose, and procedurally unfair under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA). The High Court dismissed Bryntirion’s application for disclosure of privileged documents and upheld the expropriation decision; Bryntirion appealed.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised three principal issues: (1) whether the Minister’s decision to expropriate was irrational or taken for an ulterior purpose and therefore unlawful under the Expropriation Act; (2) whether the decision complied with the procedural fairness requirements of PAJA, specifically adequate notice, sufficient information to enable meaningful representations, and a reasonable opportunity to be heard; and (3) whether the purpose of the expropriation satisfied the statutory requirement of a \"public purpose\".",
    "principles": "The Court applied the Expropriation Act 63 of 1975, which requires that expropriation be for a public purpose, be the product of a bona fide exercise of discretion, and not be arbitrary or irrational. Under PAJA, administrative action that materially and adversely affects rights must be procedurally fair, which includes giving notice of the nature and purpose of the action and an opportunity to make representations with sufficient information. The rationality test requires that the decision be based on relevant considerations and not on irrelevant or incorrect facts that materially affect the outcome. The Court also noted that the expropriating authority has discretion to determine the most effective means of achieving its public purpose, even where alternative measures exist.",
    "application": "The Court found that the Minister’s decision was grounded in legitimate security concerns for the Bryntirion Estate, a recognized public purpose. Although some factual information presented to the Minister was later found to be inaccurate, the Court held that this did not render the decision irrational because the core purpose – enhancing security for government officials – remained valid. Regarding procedural fairness, the Court concluded that Bryntirion received ample notice of the purpose of the expropriation, was invited to make representations on four occasions, and was provided with sufficient information to understand the reasons for the proposed acquisition. The refusal to disclose privileged legal opinions and certain security‑sensitive details was deemed permissible. Consequently, the Court found no breach of PAJA or the Expropriation Act.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, including costs of two counsel where so employed. The expropriation of Erf 16 Bryntirion was upheld as lawful, rational, and procedurally fair."
