The order of the Western Cape\r\nHigh Court (Erasmus and Allie JJ), dated 18 August 2009, is set\r\naside.\n2. The appellant is granted leave\r\nto appeal against his convictions and sentence.\n___________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\nTHERON JA (STREICHER and BOSIELO\r\nJJA concurring)\n[1] The appellant stood trial in\r\nthe Regional Court, Mossel Bay, on charges of sexual assault and\r\nrape, read with the provisions\nof Act 105 of 1997. The incident\r\ngiving rise to these charges being preferred against the appellant\r\nwas alleged to have occurred\nduring the period December 2004 to\r\nJanuary 2005. The appellant was charged on 30 May 2008. Despite his\r\nplea of not guilty in respect\nof both charges, the appellant was, at\r\nthe end of the trial found guilty and sentenced to an effective term\r\nof imprisonment of\neight years.\n[2] On 18 June 2009 and\r\nimmediately after judgment on sentence was delivered, the appellant\r\napplied for leave to appeal against\nthe convictions. This application\r\nwas refused. The appellant subsequently petitioned the Western Cape\r\nJudge President for leave\nto appeal against the convictions and\r\nsentence in terms of\ns 309C\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\n.\r\nOn 18 August 2009, the Western Cape High Court (Erasmus and Allie JJ)\r\nrefused his petition.\n[3] The appellant applied to the\r\nhigh court for leave to appeal against its decision refusing leave to\r\nappeal against his convictions\nand sentence. The high court\r\napparently had second thoughts about its decision to refuse leave and\r\ngranted the appellant leave\nto appeal to this court against the high\r\ncourt’s refusal of his petition.\n[4] At the hearing of this\r\nappeal, counsel for the state conceded that there was a reasonable\r\npossibility that another court could\nreach a different conclusion to\r\nthat of the trial court. No more need be said.\n[5] In the circumstances the\r\nfollowing order is made:\n5.1 The order of the Western Cape\r\nHigh Court (Erasmus and Allie JJ), dated 18 August 2009, is set\r\naside.\n5.2 The appellant is granted\r\nleave to appeal against his convictions and sentence.\n____________________\nL Theron\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nAPPELLANT: DL van der Merwe\nInstructed by Heyns &\r\nPartners Inc, Cape Town;\nNaudes, Bloemfontein\nRESPONDENT: (Ms) EA Kortje\nInstructed by the Director of\r\nPublic Prosecutions, Cape Town;\nThe Director of Public\r\nProsecutions, Bloemfontein",

    "facts": "The appellant, James Patrick Hibbert, was tried in the Regional Court at Mossel Bay on charges of sexual assault and rape, offences arising from alleged incidents that took place between December 2004 and January 2005. He was charged on 30 May 2008, pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty and sentenced to an effective term of eight years' imprisonment. On 18 June 2009, Hibbert applied for leave to appeal against his convictions and sentence; the application was refused. He then petitioned the Western Cape Judge President for leave to appeal under s 309C of the Criminal Procedure Act, and on 18 August 2009 the Western Cape High Court also refused his petition.",
    "issues": "The central issue was whether the appellant should be granted leave to appeal against the convictions and sentence despite the High Court's refusal. Specifically, the question was whether there was a reasonable possibility that a different court could reach a different conclusion from the trial court, justifying the grant of leave under the Criminal Procedure Act.",
    "principles": "Under s 309C of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977, leave to appeal may be granted where there is a reasonable prospect that an appellate court could reach a different outcome. The court considered the standard set by precedent that the existence of a reasonable possibility of a different conclusion suffices for granting leave. The State's concession that another court might reach a different conclusion satisfied this requirement.",
    "application": "Applying the legal principle, the Supreme Court of Appeal examined the High Court's refusal and determined that the reasonable possibility identified by the State met the threshold for leave. Consequently, the earlier order refusing leave was set aside, and the appellant was permitted to proceed to an appeal on the merits of his convictions and sentence.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal set aside the Western Cape High Court's order dated 18 August 2009 and granted the appellant leave to appeal against his convictions and sentence."
