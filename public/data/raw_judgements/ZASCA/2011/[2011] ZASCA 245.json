On 24 July 2007, the South Gauteng\r\nHigh Court (Johannesburg) granted an\norder pursuant to the provisions\r\nof s 9 of the Supreme Court Act 41 of 2001, for the transfer of the\r\nproceedings to the KwaZulu-Natal\nHigh Court (Durban). That court\r\n(Motala AJ) granted the relief sought, and it is against this order\r\nthat the IDC appeals, with\nits leave. The issue on appeal, as in the\r\nhigh court, is the interpretation of s 7 of PAIA and its\r\napplicability to this matter.\n[2] The first and second\r\nrespondents, PFE International Inc (BVI) (PFE) and PFE International\r\nInc (Liberia), respectively, are companies\nin the PFE Group that\r\ncarried on various businesses including the manufacture of carpets.\r\nPrior to 14 September 2001, the IDC owned\napproximately 98 per cent\r\nof the shares in South African Fibre Yarns Rugs Ltd (SAFYR). On 14\r\nSeptember 2001, an agreement was concluded\nin terms of which PFE\r\nacquired 45 per cent of the issued share capital of SAFYR from the\r\nIDC. Pursuant to this agreement, the fourth\nand fifth respondents\r\n(Mehdy Zarrebini and Mehran Zarrebini, respectively), were appointed\r\nas directors of SAFYR. The agreement\nwas subsequently terminated and\r\nthe fourth and fifth respondents resigned as directors of SAFYR. PFE\r\n(BVI) re-transferred its shares\nin SAFYR to the IDC. While the fourth\r\nand fifth respondents were still directors of SAFYR, PFE acquired\r\nshares in the third respondent,\nVan Dyck Carpets (Pty) Ltd (Van\r\nDyck).\n[3] SAFYR subsequently\r\ninstituted proceedings in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court (Durban),\r\ncontending that the fourth and fifth respondents\nhad breached the\r\nfiduciary duties they owed SAFYR, as directors, in failing to afford\r\nto SAFYR the opportunity to purchase the\nshares in Van Dyck when\r\nthose shares were offered to the fourth and fifth respondents. SAFYR\r\nsought an order that the respondents\n‘disgorge’ the\r\nshares in Van Dyck to SAFYR. These proceedings were referred to trial\r\nand after the exchange and close\nof pleadings, SAFYR requested\r\nfurther particulars for trial.\n[4] On 26 January 2007,\r\nthe respondents, via their attorney, delivered a request, in terms of\r\ns 18 of PAIA, to the IDC for information\nand access to the latter’s\r\nrecords. The IDC did not respond to the request. This led to the\r\nrespondents instituting these\nproceedings against the IDC in the\r\ncourt below. The main grounds relied upon by the respondents for\r\ntheir entitlement to the records\nappear from the following paragraphs\r\nof the affidavit filed on their behalf:\n‘\nthe information necessary to\r\nrespond to some of the particulars requested [by SAFYR] … is\r\ncontained in the documents requested\n… and the information in\r\nthose documents and records is perculiarly within the knowledge of\r\nthe respondent [IDC] in the\nsense that in order to respond to the\r\nrequest for further particulars for trial the applicants require\r\naccess to the documents\nrequested … so as to be able to obtain\r\nthe necessary information\n…\n.\nthe applicants also require access to\r\nthe information and records to prepare for trial but:\nas the respondent is not a party to\r\n\tthe application, it cannot be compelled to make discovery;\nthe identity of the particular books\r\n\tand records is within the peculiar knowledge of the respondent and\r\n\tcannot be identified for\nthe purpose of a subpoena\nduces tecum\n.’\n[5] The basis of the\r\nIDC’s opposition to the application was set out in the\r\nanswering affidavit, as follows:\n‘\nOn their own affidavit the\r\napplicants seek the information which they have sought “for the\r\npurpose of … civil proceedings”.\nThose proceedings\r\ncommenced a long time before the request was made and the records\r\nrequested can be obtained by way of subpoena\nduces\r\ntecum\nunder Uniform Rule\r\n38(1)(a). The result is that in terms of section 7(1) of the\r\nPromotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000\n(“PAIA”)\r\nthe information requested cannot be sought in terms of PAIA.’\n[6] Section 32 of the\r\nConstitution confers upon every person ‘the right of access to\r\nany information that is held by the state’.\nThe section also\r\nimposes upon Parliament the obligation to enact national legislation\r\nto give effect to this right. PAIA is that\nlegislation. The purpose\r\nof PAIA, as stated in the preamble, is ‘to give effect to the\r\nconstitutional right of access to\nany information held by the State\r\nand any information that is held by another person and that is\r\nrequired for the exercise or protection\nof any rights’. The\r\nobjects of PAIA are set out in s 9 and these include:\n‘\n(a) to give effect to the\r\nconstitutional right of access to-\n(i) any information held by the State;\r\nand\n(ii) any information that is held by\r\nanother person and that is required for the exercise or protection of\r\nany rights;\n(b) to give effect to that right—\n(i) subject to justifiable\r\nlimitations, including, but not limited to, limitations aimed at the\r\nreasonable protection of privacy,\ncommercial confidentiality and\r\neffective, efficient and good governance; and\n(ii) in a manner which balances that\r\nright with any other rights, including the rights in the Bill of\r\nRights in Chapter 2 of the\nConstitution;\n(c) to give effect to the\r\nconstitutional obligations of the State of promoting a human rights\r\nculture and social justice .…’\n[7] It was not disputed\r\nthat the IDC is a public body as defined in the Act. The issue in the\r\ncourt below, and on appeal, centered\non the interpretation of s\r\n7(1)(c) and in particular, whether it excludes the respondents’\r\nrequest for records from the application\nof the Act on the basis that\r\nthe Uniform Rules provide for the production of or access to such\r\nrecords.\n[8] The right of access\r\nto information that is held by the state is, however, limited by PAIA\r\nitself.\nIn terms of s 7(1),\nPAIA\r\ndoes not apply in particular circumstances. The section reads:\n‘\nThis Act does not apply to a\r\nrecord of a public body or a private body if—\n(a) that record is requested for the\r\npurpose of criminal or civil proceedings;\n(b) so requested after the\r\ncommencement of such criminal or civil proceedings, as the case may\r\nbe; and\n(c) the production of or access to\r\nthat record for the purpose referred to in paragraph (a) is provided\r\nfor in any other law.’\nAll three of the\r\nrequirements of s 7(1) must be met in order to render PAIA\r\ninapplicable to the request. On the common cause facts\nin this\r\nmatter, the first two requirements of s 7(1), namely, that the\r\nrecords were requested for the purpose of civil proceedings\nand such\r\nrequest was made after the commencement of the civil proceedings,\r\nwere satisfied. This appeal turns on whether or not\nthe third\r\nrequirement was met, namely, that the production of or access to the\r\nrequested record is provided for in any other law.\n[9] The purpose of s 7 is\r\nto prevent PAIA from having any impact on the law relating to\r\ndiscovery or compulsion of evidence in civil\nand criminal\r\nproceedings.\n1\nIn the event that ‘the\r\nproduction of or access to’ the record ‘is provided for\r\nin any other law’ then the\nexemption takes effect. The\r\nLegislature has framed s 7 in terms intended to convey that requests\r\nfor access to records made for\nthe purpose of litigation, and after\r\nlitigation has commenced, should be regulated by the Rules of Court\r\ngoverning such access\nin the course of litigation. This was the view\r\nof Harms DP in\nNational\r\nDirector of Public Prosecutions v King\n,\n2\nwhere it was held that\r\n‘any other law’, in the context of s 7, refers to the\r\nbody of law which includes the rules relating\nto discovery,\r\ndisclosure and privilege. The learned judge endorsed the view\r\nexpressed by Brand JA in\nUnitas\r\nHospital v Van Wyk & another\n,\n3\nthat PAIA was not\r\nintended to have any impact on the discovery procedure in civil\r\ncases. Harms DP went on to quote, with approval,\nthe statement by\r\nBrand JA that ‘[o]nce court proceedings between the parties\r\nhave commenced, the rules of discovery take\nover’.\n[10] In\nIngledew\r\nv Financial Services Board: In Re Financial Services Board v Van der\r\nMerwe & another\n,\n4\nthe Constitutional Court\r\nnoted that the adoption of the approach that once litigation has\r\ncommenced discovery should be regulated\nby the Uniform Rules, can\r\ngive rise to ‘certain anomalies’. Ngcobo J, writing for\r\nthe court, stated:\n‘\nUnder the wording of s\r\n32(1)(a), the applicant would prima facie have been entitled to all\r\nthe documents he now seeks until the\nday before summons was served on\r\nhim. Moreover, a third party might have approached another for access\r\nto those documents during\nthe course of the applicant's litigation.\r\nIn the present case, however, it is not necessary to deal with these\r\nissues or the different\nviews expressed in the decided cases and I\r\nprefer to leave those issues open.’\n5\nThis anomaly, that an\r\napplicant may be entitled to information the day before the\r\ncommencement of proceedings but not the day thereafter,\nmust be seen\r\nas a necessary consequence of the intention, on the part of the\r\nLegislature, to protect the process of the court.\nOnce proceedings\r\nare instituted then the parties should be governed by the applicable\r\nrules of court.\n6\n[11] The IDC contends\r\nthat the Uniform Rules relating to subpoenas are laws that provide\r\nfor ‘the production of or access\nto’ the records sought\r\nby the respondents. Rule 38(1), which regulates the procedure\r\ncompelling the production of documents\nby a witness for purposes of\r\nlitigation, reads as follows:\n‘\n(1) (a) Any party, desiring the\r\nattendance of any person to give evidence at a trial, may as of\r\nright, without any prior proceeding\nwhatsoever, sue out from the\r\noffice of the registrar one or more subpoenas for that purpose, each\r\nof which subpoenas shall contain\nthe names of not more than four\r\npersons, and service thereof upon any person therein named shall be\r\neffected by the sheriff in\nthe manner prescribed by rule 4, and the\r\nprocess for subpoenaing such witnesses shall be, as nearly as may be,\r\nin accordance with\nForm 16 in the First Schedule.\nIf any witness has in his possession\r\nor control any deed, instrument, writing or thing which the party\r\nrequiring his attendance\ndesires to be produced in evidence, the\r\nsubpoena shall specify such document or thing and require him to\r\nproduce it to the court\nat the trial.\n(b) Any witness who has been required\r\nto produce any deed, document, writing or tape recording at the trial\r\nshall hand it over to\nthe registrar as soon as possible, unless the\r\nwitness claims that the deed, document, writing or tape recording is\r\nprivileged.\nThereafter the parties may inspect such deed, document,\r\nwriting or tape recording and make copies or transcriptions thereof,\r\nafter\nwhich the witness is entitled to its return.’\nIn terms of this rule,\r\nthe production of a document by a witness is obtained by the issuing\r\nof a subpoena\nduces tecum\n. It must be borne in mind that rule\r\n38(1) is contemplated by s 30 of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959,\r\nwhich provides that a party\nto civil proceedings ‘may procure\r\nthe attendance of any witness or the production of any document or\r\nthing in the manner\nprovided for in the rules of court’.\n[12] Section 7(1)(\nc\n)\r\ndoes not stipulate, as a condition for the application of the ouster\r\nprovision contained in that section, that the ‘other\nlaw’\r\nshould provide for the production of or access to the record\r\nconcerned at the time when it might be obtained if the\nprovisions of\r\nPAIA were to apply. The section simply requires that the ‘other\r\nlaw’ (in this instance rule 38(1)) should\nprovide for the\r\nproduction of or access to the record. Rule 38 achieves that purpose.\r\nThe rules of court relating to subpoenas,\nare laws which provide for\r\n‘the production of or access to’ records and these\r\ninclude records held by persons who are\nnot parties to the\r\nlitigation. To find otherwise would be contrary to the basic\r\nprinciple established in\nUnitas Hospital\nthat PAIA was not\r\nintended to have an impact on court procedure. It is so that the\r\ncourt in\nUnitas Hospital\nwas dealing with discovery while this\r\nmatter concerns the issue of a subpoena. However, both of these\r\nprocedures are provided for\nin the Uniform Rules.\n[13] It was argued that\r\nthere is a distinction because of the timing: discovery is required\r\nafter close of pleadings whereas a witness\nis generally subpoenaed\r\nonly when the trial is about to commence. But there is no reason why\r\na party should not serve a\nsubpoena duces tecum\nat any stage\r\nof the procedure. The documents, tape recordings, computer records\r\nand other material required may be deposited with\nthe Registrar,\r\nunder rule 38(1)(b), before the trial commences, and the party who\r\nhas issued the subpoena may inspect and copy\nthe material so\r\nrequired. While it is true that the provisions of rule 38(1) are not\r\ndesigned to enable a party to identify the\nmaterial to be made\r\navailable, they nonetheless may serve that purpose. There is no\r\nreason to distinguish between discovery and\nsecuring documentary\r\nevidence from a third party. This is in accordance with an intention\r\nto leave intact the existing body of\nrules designed to facilitate the\r\nconduct of trials.\n[14] It is also so that\r\nthe application was brought against a body not party to the\r\nlitigation itself. The distinction makes no\ndifference given the\r\nprovisions of rule 38. This case then falls within the exclusion of\r\nthe application of PAIA by s 7(1), as\ninterpreted by this court in\r\nthe cases referred to above.\n[15] The contention\r\nadvanced on behalf of the respondents that PAIA was intended to\r\nsupplement the rules of court, cannot be sustained.\nFirst, s 7 does\r\nnot express such an intention. In fact, the section says the\r\nopposite. Second, and as has already been mentioned,\nand on this\r\ncourt’s interpretation of s 7, it was the intention of the\r\nLegislature that requests for access to information\nmade for the\r\npurpose of litigation, and after litigation has commenced, should be\r\nregulated by the applicable court rules. Third,\nto create a dual\r\nsystem of access to information, in terms of both PAIA and the\r\nparticular court rules, has the potential to be\nextremely disruptive\r\nto court proceedings, as is evidenced by this matter.\n[16] For these reasons,\r\nthe following order is made:\n1 The appeal is upheld.\n2 The respondents are\r\nordered, jointly and severally, to pay the costs of the appeal.\n3 The order of the high\r\ncourt is set aside and replaced with:\n‘\na The application\r\nis dismissed.\nb The applicants are\r\nordered, jointly and severally, to pay the costs of the application.’\n____________\nL V THERON\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAppearances:\nAppellant:\r\nP J Olsen SC\nInstructed by: Deneys Reitz Inc,\r\nDurban\nWebbers, Bloemfontein\nRespondents: D J Shaw SC (with A W M\r\nHarcourt SC)\nInstructed by: Bakers Attorneys,\r\nDurban\nMatsepes Inc, Bloemfontein\n1\nNational\r\n\tDirector of Public Prosecutions v King\n[2010]\r\n\t3 All SA 304\n(SCA) para 39;\nUnitas\r\n\tHospital v Van Wyk & another\n[2006] ZASCA 34\n;\n2006\r\n\t(4) SA 436\n(SCA) para 19;\nRail\r\n\tCommuter Action Group & others v Transet Ltd t/a Metrorail &\r\n\tothers (No 1)\n2003 (5) SA\r\n\t518\n(C) at 587I-J.

    "facts": "The Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Ltd (IDC) originally owned about 98% of South African Fibre Yarns Rugs Ltd (SAFYR). In September 2001 PFE International Inc (BVI) purchased 45% of SAFYR and appointed Mehdy and Mehran Zarrebini as directors. The share purchase was later terminated, the Zarrebini brothers resigned, and PFE re‑transferred its shares to IDC while also acquiring shares in Van Dyck Carpets (Pty) Ltd. SAFYR sued the Zarrebini brothers in the KwaZulu‑Natal High Court for breaching fiduciary duties by not offering SAFYR the opportunity to purchase the Van Dyck shares. During the proceedings SAFYR requested further particulars and needed documents held by IDC. On 26 January 2007 the respondents served IDC with a request for information under s 18 of the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA). IDC did not comply, leading the respondents to institute proceedings seeking a court order compelling IDC to furnish the documents. The High Court granted the relief, and IDC appealed.",
    "issues": "Whether section 7(1)(c) of PAIA exempts the respondents’ request for documents because the production of those records is already provided for by another law – namely the Uniform Rules of Court (Rule 38 subpoena provisions) – thereby rendering PAIA inapplicable to the request.",
    "principles": "Section 32 of the Constitution guarantees a right of access to information, which is implemented by PAIA. However, s 7(1) of PAIA excludes its application when (a) the request is for civil or criminal proceedings, (b) the request is made after the commencement of those proceedings, and (c) the production of the record is provided for in any other law. The purpose of s 7 is to preserve the operation of existing discovery and evidence rules. Precedents cited include National Director of Public Prosecutions v King (s 7’s “any other law” refers to discovery rules), Unitas Hospital v Van Wyk (PAIA should not interfere with court procedures), and Ingledew v Financial Services Board (recognising a limited anomaly but affirming the legislative intention to protect court processes). Rule 38(1) of the Uniform Rules, which allows subpoenas duces tecum, is considered “other law” that provides for the production of documents.",
    "application": "The Court examined whether Rule 38(1) satisfied the third limb of s 7(1). It concluded that the rule indeed provides for the production of documents, even from non‑parties, and therefore the exemption applies. Consequently, PAIA could not be used to compel IDC to produce the documents; the Uniform Rules govern such disclosure. The Court rejected the argument that PAIA supplemented the court rules, emphasizing that s 7 expressly prevents a dual system and that the rules of court remain supreme once litigation has commenced.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The High Court order compelling IDC to furnish the documents under PAIA was set aside and replaced with an order dismissing the application. The respondents were ordered jointly and severally to pay the costs of the appeal and of the application."
