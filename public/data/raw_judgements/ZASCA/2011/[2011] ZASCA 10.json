They\r\nwere issued at the behest of the first\nrespondent, Zanbuild\r\nConstruction (Pty) Ltd (Zanbuild). Though Absa was joined as a party,\r\nboth in the court of first instance\nand on appeal, it abides the\r\ndecision of this court as it did in the court a quo.\n[2] On 26 September 2008\r\nthe department demanded payment from Absa under the guarantees. When\r\nthis demand came to the notice of\nZanbuild, it approached the Western\r\nCape High Court for an order, essentially interdicting the department\r\nfrom seeking –\nand Absa from making – payment under the\r\nguarantees. The matter came before Louw J who granted the interdict\r\nsought. Subsequently,\nhe afforded the appellants leave to appeal to\r\nthis Court against that order.\n[3] The guarantees were\r\nissued with reference to two separate construction contracts entered\r\ninto between the department and Zanbuild\nat the end of January 2007.\r\nAs in the case of the guarantees themselves, these contracts (the\r\nconstruction contracts) were also\nidentical in their material\r\nprovisions. In terms of the construction contracts, Zanbuild\r\nundertook to construct pathology laboratories\nat the Eben Dönges\r\nHospital, Worcester (the Worcester project) and the TC Newman\r\nHospital in Paarl (the Paarl project). By\nexpress agreement, the\r\nconstruction contracts incorporated the standard terms proposed by\r\nthe Joint Building Contracts Committee\n(the JBCC).\n[4] Standard clause 14 of\r\nthe JBCC deals with security to be provided by the contractor. That\r\nclause, however, is immaterial because\nthe department in its letters\r\naccepting Zanbuild’s tenders for the two projects required a\r\nguarantee in accordance with the\ndepartment’s standard\r\nguarantee form, which is not an option provided for in clause 14. But\r\nthe department’s standard\nguarantee form is also immaterial.\r\nThe guarantees issued by Absa, which gave rise to the present\r\ndispute, were substantially different\nfrom the department’s\r\nstandard form. Nonetheless, they were issued with the acquiescence of\r\nZanbuild and accepted by the\ndepartment.\n[5] Each guarantee is for\r\nan amount equal to 10 per cent of the value of the contract to which\r\nit pertains. Thus the guarantee relating\nto the Worcester project is\r\nfor R1 181 104.80, while the guarantee linked to the Paarl\r\nproject is for R1 106 500.00.\nOther than this, the terms of\r\nthe two guarantees are identical. When it comes to the interpretation\r\nof these terms I shall refer\nto them in more detail. But continuation\r\nof the present narrative requires reference to one of these terms\r\nwhich reads as follows:\n‘\nThe\r\nbank reserves the right to withdraw the guarantee after the employer\r\nhas been given 30 (thirty) days written notice of its intention\nto do\r\nso, provided the employer shall have the right to recover from the\r\nbank the amount owing and due to the employer by the contractor\non\r\nthe date the notice period expires.’\n[6] Relying on this\r\nprovision, Absa notified the department on 28 August 2008 that it\r\nwished to withdraw from the guarantees and\nthat, consequently, the\r\n‘guarantees will be cancelled one month from the date of this\r\nletter on 28 September 2008 whereafter\nno further claims or payments\r\nwill be considered’.\n[7] Two days before the\r\nstipulated expiry date, ie on 26 September 2008, the department\r\nresponded to this notice by demanding immediate\npayment of the full\r\namount of both guarantees. Amongst other things the letter of demand\r\nstated that:\n‘\nThe\r\ncontractor has defaulted on both contracts, see attached Annex “A”\r\nbut the contracts have not been cancelled yet.\nIn terms of your\r\nletter of withdrawal of guarantees dated 28 August 2008, you intend\r\nto cancel the guarantees on 28 September 2008.\nThe\r\ndepartment therefore in accordance with the terms of the guarantee\r\nwhich affords us the right to recover this amount from the\nbank . . .\r\ndemands payment of the guaranteed amounts.’\n[8] Annex ‘A’\r\nreferred to is a letter of 4 August 2008 by the architect acting as\r\nprincipal agent for the department\nin terms of the construction\r\ncontracts, to Zanbuild. In essence it informed Zanbuild that:\nboth the department and\r\n\tthe principal agent were of the view that Zanbuild was in breach of\r\n\tthe construction contracts in that\nit had failed to execute the\r\n\tworks ‘with due skill, diligence, regularity and expedition’;\nZanbuild was afforded a\r\n\tperiod of ten days to remedy its breach, ‘failing which the\r\n\temployer may proceed and give you notice\nof cancellation’.\n[9] As it happened, the\r\ndepartment purported to cancel the construction contracts on 9\r\nOctober 2008. Zanbuild disputed that it was\nentitled to do so, but\r\nchose to accept the purported cancellation as a repudiation by the\r\ndepartment. The upshot is that on any\naccount the construction\r\ncontract came to an end before either of the projects had reached\r\ncompletion.\n[10] The department does\r\nnot contend that at present it has an identifiable monetary claim\r\nunder the construction contract against\nZanbuild. In this regard\r\nclause 33 of the construction contracts provides for different\r\npotential claims sounding in money against\nthe contractor. Pertinent\r\namongst these are penalties for late completion and claims for\r\nexpenses and loss flowing from the need\nto employ an alternative\r\ncontractor. But the department does not allege that any claim of this\r\nnature arose against Zanbuild when\nthe guarantees expired on 28\r\nSeptember 2008. In fact, the last payment certificates issued under\r\nthe construction contracts on\nthe eve of their termination (8 October\r\n2008) tend to show otherwise.\n[11] This brings me to\r\nthe analysis of the guarantees. According to the interpretation\r\ncontended for by Zanbuild – which found\nfavour with the High\r\nCourt – the guarantees are inextricably linked to the\r\nconstruction contracts in a manner akin to a suretyship\nagreement.\r\nHence, so Zanbuild argued, Absa’s liability under the guarantee\r\nis limited to the extent that the department can\ndemonstrate a\r\nmonetary claim against Zanbuild under the construction contracts.\r\nBecause Absa did not even allege that it had any\nclaim in terms of\r\nthe construction contracts, it follows that it had no claim against\r\nAbsa under the guarantees.\n[12] The contrary\r\ninterpretation contended for by the department is that the guarantees\r\nare independent from the construction contracts\nin a manner\r\ncomparable to irrevocable letters of credit issued by banks where the\r\nobligation of the bank is wholly independent\nof the underlying\r\ncontract of sale. Hence, so the department contended, the guarantees\r\ncan be invoked without any allegation or\nevidence of any claim\r\nagainst Zanbuild under the construction contracts. All the department\r\nhad to do to procure payment of the\nfull amounts guaranteed was to\r\nsubmit a statement to Absa that Zanbuild was in default in terms of\r\nthe construction contracts.\n[13]\r\nIn the parlance of the English authorities\n1\nthe dispute can be usefully\r\nparaphrased as being whether the guarantees are ‘conditional\r\nbonds’\n2\n(as suggested by Zanbuild) or ‘on\r\ndemand bonds’ (as suggested by the department). The essential\r\ndifference between the\ntwo, as appears from these authorities, is\r\nthat a claimant under a conditional bond is required at least to\r\nallege and –\ndepending on the terms of the bond –\r\nsometimes also to establish liability on the part of the contractor\r\nfor the same amount.\nAn ‘on demand’ bond, also referred\r\nto as a ‘call bond’, on the other hand, requires no\r\nallegation of liability\non the part of the contractor under the\r\nconstruction contracts. All that is required for payment is a demand\r\nby the claimant, stated\nto be on the basis of the event specified in\r\nthe bond.\n[14]\r\nOur law is familiar with the distinction. In\nDormell\r\nProperties 282 CC v Renasa Insurance Co Ltd & others NNO\n3\nand\nLombard\r\nInsurance Co Ltd v Landmark Holdings (Pty) Ltd,\n4\nfor example, the construction\r\nguarantees involved were construed by this court as ‘on demand’\r\nbonds while in\nBasil Read\r\n(Pty) Ltd v Beta Hotels (Pty) Ltd & others\n5\nthe guarantee was interpreted to\r\ncreate conditional liability akin to that of a surety. In English\r\nlaw, as in our law, it is accepted\nthat the question whether the\r\nguarantee under consideration constitutes the one or the other is\r\ndependent on the interpretation\nof the terms of that guarantee.\n[15]\r\nAs support for its contention that the guarantees under consideration\r\nconstitute ‘on demand’ or ‘call’\nguarantees,\r\nthe department relied on the statement in\nLombard\r\nInsurance\n6\nthat:\n‘\nThe\r\nguarantee by Lombard is not unlike irrevocable letters of credit\r\nissued by banks and used in international trade, the essential\n\nfeature of which is the establishment of a contractual obligation on\r\nthe part of a bank to pay the beneficiary (seller). This obligation\n\nis wholly independent of the underlying contract of sale and assures\r\nthe seller of payment of the purchase price before he or she\nparts\r\nwith the goods being sold. Whatever disputes may subsequently arise\r\nbetween buyer and seller is of no moment insofar as the\nbank’s\r\nobligation is concerned. . . . The bank undertakes to pay provided\r\nonly that the conditions specified in the credit\nare met. The only\r\nbasis upon which the bank can escape liability is proof of fraud on\r\nthe part of the beneficiary.’\n[16]\r\nIn addition the department also sought to rely on certain statements\r\nin\nDormell Properties\n7\nwhich essentially endorsed the\r\napproach in\nLombard\r\nInsurance\n. It is clear to\r\nme, however, that the statements relied on by the department must be\r\nconfined to the terms of the guarantees considered\nin those cases.\r\nThe exact terms of the guarantee in\nLombard\r\nInsurance\ndo not appear\r\nfrom the reported judgment. But examination of the record of that\r\ncase filed in this court shows that the terms of\nthe\nLombard\nguarantees were, for present purposes,\r\nexactly the same as those of the guarantee in\nDormell\r\nProperties,\nwhich are in\r\nturn fully recorded in the latter judgment.\n8\n[17] Moreover, it appears\r\nthat the terms of the guarantees in\nLombard Insurance\nand\nDormell Properties\nare essentially identical to those of the\r\nstandard guarantee that the department called for in its letters\r\naccepting the Zanbuild\ntenders for both projects. But, as we know,\r\nwhat the department wanted is not what the department got. A\r\ncomparison of the terms\nof the department’s standard guarantee,\r\nas appears from the judgment in\nDormell Properties,\non the one\r\nhand, with those of the guarantees in this case – to which I\r\nwill presently return – on the other hand,\nreveals substantial\r\ndifferences. The consequence of these differences is, in my view,\r\nself-evident. The Absa guarantees cannot\nbe interpreted, as the\r\ndepartment sought to do, with reference to the terms of the standard\r\nguarantee, or, indirectly, with reference\nto statements in\nLombard\r\nInsurance\nand\nDormell Properties\nwith regard to those\r\nterms.\n[18] I now turn to the\r\nterms of the guarantees under consideration. In relevant part they\r\nprovide:\n‘\n.\r\n. . whereas it is stipulated in the [construction] contract that the\r\ncontractor [ie Zanbuild] shall provide the employer [ie the\n\ndepartment] with a bank guarantee of 10% of the contract value . . .\r\nas security for the compliance of the contractors performance\nof\r\nobligations in accordance with the contract,\nand\r\nwhereas the bank [ie Absa] is willing to agree to guarantee an amount\r\n. . . which is equal to 10% of the contract value under\ncertain\r\nconditions stipulated hereafter . . . .\nNow\r\ntherefore we the undersigned . . . in our capacities as [employees\r\nof] the bank do hereby guarantee and bind the bank as guarantor\nfor\r\nthe due and faithful performance by the contractor of all its\r\nobligations in terms of the said contract subject to the following\n\nconditions . . .\nWith\r\neach payment under this guarantee the bank’s obligation shall\r\nbe reduced pro rata.\nEach\r\nclaim by the employer must be made in writing accompanied by a signed\r\nstatement that the contractor has failed to fulfil his\nobligations in\r\nterms of the contract and shall be sent to the bank’s\r\ndomicilium address as indicated below . . .\nThe\r\nbank reserves the right to withdraw the guarantee after the employer\r\nhas given 30 (thirty) days written notice of its intention\nto do so,\r\nprovided the employer shall have the right to recover from the bank\r\nthe amount owing and due to the employer by the contractor\non the\r\ndate the notice period expires.’\n[19] Construing the Absa\r\nguarantees as a whole, I agree with the view of the High Court that\r\nthey support the interpretation contended\nfor by Zanbuild. In other\r\nwords, that they do not constitute ‘on demand’ bonds, but\r\nthat they give rise to liability\non the part of Absa akin to\r\nsuretyship. The first indicator in that direction is the assertion at\r\nthe outset that the guarantee\n‘provide security for the\r\ncompliance of the contractor’s performance of obligations in\r\naccordance with the contract’.\nAnd in the body of the document\r\nthe bank guarantees ‘the due and faithful performance by the\r\ncontractor’. This accords\nwith language associated with\r\nsuretyships.\n[20]\r\nIn argument the department’s answer to this indicator was\r\ntwofold. First, that the interpretation of guarantees of this\nkind is\r\noften bedevilled by loose language. For the sake of argument, I\r\naccept that this is so.\n9\nThe second answer was that the Absa\r\nguarantees contain an indicator to the contrary. This answer relied\r\nsolely on the stipulation\nthat ‘each claim by the employer must\r\nbe made in writing accompanied by a signed statement that the\r\ncontractor has failed\nto fulfil his obligations in terms of the\r\ncontract’. What this provision means, so the department\r\ncontended, was that, in\norder to obtain payment of the guarantees in\r\nfull, the department has to do no more than to submit two documents\r\nto the bank: (a)\na claim in writing and (b) a signed statement that\r\nthe contractor is in default under the construction contract. This,\r\nso the department’s\nargument concluded, renders the guarantee\r\npayable on demand whenever the contractor is in default, irrespective\r\nof liability on\nthe part of the contractor.\n[21] What goes against\r\nthis interpretation is that the provision upon which the department\r\nrelies as the sole basis of its argument,\ncontemplates more than one\r\nclaim under the guarantee. This is also in line with the provision\r\nthat ‘with each payment under\nthis guarantee the bank’s\r\nobligation shall be reduced pro rata’. The department’s\r\ninterpretation, on the other\nhand, leaves no room for more than one\r\nclaim. Any breach of contract by the contractor would render the full\r\namount of the guarantee\ndue and payable on demand. In argument the\r\ndepartment sought to overcome this difficulty by reference to the\r\nexample of a payment\ncertificate, issued by the principal agent,\r\nreflecting a penalty owing to the department in a specific amount. In\r\nthat event, so\nthe argument went, the department would probably only\r\nclaim the amount of the penalty under the guarantee. But that is not\r\nthe\npoint. The point is that on the department’s argument, it\r\nis entitled to claim the full amount of the guarantee on the basis\nof\r\na single default. If this is so, I can think of no reason why the\r\ndepartment would claim less than what it is entitled to.\n[22] Finally there is the\r\nprovision that reserves the right to the bank to withdraw from the\r\nguarantees after 30 days notice, which\nwas as we know, invoked by the\r\nAbsa. That provision expressly limits the liability of the bank to\r\nthe amount owing by the contractor\nunder the construction contract.\r\nCounsel for the department conceded, rightly in my view, that the\r\nbank’s liability in terms\nof this provision is clearly akin to\r\nthat of a surety.\n[23] The interpretation\r\nof the provision contended for by counsel for the department was,\r\nhowever, that it only applies where the\nemployer demands payment\r\nafter the expiry of the 30 day period. Departing from that premise,\r\nthe argument proceeded as follows.\nAfter expiry of the guarantee the\r\nliability of the bank is limited to that of the contractor at the\r\ntime of expiry. But prior to\nthe expiry of the guarantee the employer\r\nis entitled to claim the full amount of the guarantee on demand. In\r\nthis case the department\ndemanded payment before the expiry of the 30\r\ndays notice of termination by Absa. Demand was therefore made prior\r\nto the expiry\nof the guarantee. In consequence the department was\r\nentitled to the full amount of the guarantees. Had the demand been\r\nmade after\nthe 30 day period and thus after the expiry of the\r\nguarantee, the department would only be entitled to payment of the\r\namount for\nwhich the contractor was liable or the date that the\r\nnotice period – and consequently, the guarantee itself –\r\nhad expired.\n[24]\r\nI do not accept this argument. It would mean that the 30 days’\r\nnotice changes the whole nature of the guarantee. Prior\nto the expiry\r\nof the period, the guarantee is the equivalent of a letter of credit.\r\nAfter expiry it retrospectively converts into\na suretyship. I can\r\nsimply find no basis for this interpretation in the wording of the\r\nguarantee. The 30 days’ notice provision,\nas I see it, is one\r\ntypically found in suretyships for an indefinite period. It affords\r\nthe right to the surety to terminate the\nsuretyship by not less than\r\na stated period of notice to the creditor.\n10\nThe effect of the notice is rather\r\nobvious. The surety is not liable for amounts that become due by the\r\nprincipal debtor after expiry\nof the notice period. Yet the surety’s\r\nliability for amounts owing by the principal debtor before expiry of\r\nthe period, remain\nunaffected.\n11\nThat, I believe, is the effect of the\r\n30 days notice provision in the Absa guarantees. The notice does not\r\nchange the liability\nof the bank prior to the expiry of the notice\r\nperiod. The bank remains liable, as it always was during the currency\r\nof the guarantee,\nfor the amounts due to the employer by the\r\ncontractor under the construction contracts. Since the department had\r\nestablished no\namount due to it by Zanbuild during the currency of\r\nthe guarantees, the High Court rightly held that it was not entitled\r\nto demand\npayment under the guarantees from Absa.\n[25] For these reasons\r\nthe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n…………………\n..\nF D J BRAND\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCounsel\r\nfor Appellants: H M Scholtz SC\nC\r\nTsegarie\nInstructed\r\nby: State Attorney\nCAPE\r\nTOWN\nCorrespondents:\r\nState Attorney\nBLOEMFONTEIN\nCounsel\r\nfor First Respondent: D Borgström\nInstructed\r\nby: Maurice Phillips Wisenberg\nCAPE\r\nTOWN\nCorrespondents: Lovius Block\r\nAttorneys\nBLOEMFONTEIN\n1\nSee\r\n\teg LN Duncan Wallace\nHudson’s Building and Engineering\r\n\tContracts\nVol 2 11 ed (1995) paras 17.003-17.009 at p 1497-1501;\nTrafalgar House Construction (Bregions) Ltd v General Surity and\r\n\tGuarantee Co Ltd\n[1995] 3 All ER 737\n(HL) at 742j-743d;\nVossloh\r\n\tAktiengesellschaft v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd\n[2010]\r\n\tEWHC 2443\n(Ch) paras 19-28.\n2\nSince\r\n\tthe liability of the bondsman is conditional upon the liability of\r\n\tthe contractor for the same amount.

    "facts": "The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works entered into two identical construction contracts with Zanbuild Construction (Pty) Ltd in January 2007 for pathology laboratories at the Eben Dönges Hospital (Worcester) and the TC Newman Hospital (Paarl). Each contract required Zanbuild to provide a bank guarantee equal to 10% of the contract value. Absa Bank Ltd issued the guarantees for R1,181,104.80 (Worcester) and R1,106,500.00 (Paarl). On 28 August 2008 Absa gave the department 30 days' notice of its intention to withdraw the guarantees, effective 28 September 2008. On 26 September 2008, before the notice period expired, the department demanded immediate payment of the full guaranteed amounts, alleging Zanbuild’s default. The department later attempted to cancel the construction contracts on 9 October 2008. No specific monetary claim against Zanbuild had been established at the time the guarantees were to expire. The High Court interdicted the department from demanding payment, and the matter was appealed.",
    "issues": "The core issue was whether the construction guarantees were conditional bonds (suretyships) whose liability is limited to the amount the contractor owes under the construction contracts, or on‑demand (call) bonds payable in full upon the employer’s declaration of default irrespective of any proven contractor liability. Related sub‑issues included the effect of the 30‑day notice of withdrawal on the bank’s liability and whether the department could claim the full guaranteed sums before the notice period expired.",
    "principles": "The court applied the distinction between conditional bonds and on‑demand bonds, drawing on South African cases such as Dormell Properties 282 CC v Renasa Insurance, Lombard Insurance v Landmark Holdings, and Basil Read (Pty) Ltd v Beta Hotels (Pty) Ltd. Conditional bonds require the claimant to allege and often prove the contractor’s liability; on‑demand bonds allow payment upon a simple demand. The language of the guarantees, which referenced security for performance and required a written claim accompanied by a statement of default, was interpreted as indicative of a suretyship. The 30‑day notice provision was identified as a typical feature of suretyships, limiting the surety’s liability only for obligations arising after the notice period.",
    "application": "The court read the guarantees as a whole and concluded that they secured the contractor’s faithful performance, not a payable on‑demand instrument. The requirement that the employer submit a written claim with a statement of default meant the department had to establish a monetary claim against Zanbuild before invoking the guarantee. Because no such claim existed at the time the guarantee was to be called, and because the 30‑day notice did not alter liability prior to its expiry, the department was not entitled to payment. The department’s argument that a pre‑expiry demand could trigger full payment was rejected as inconsistent with the guarantee’s wording and with established suretyship principles.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed with costs. The High Court’s interdict preventing the department from demanding payment under the guarantees was upheld, confirming that the guarantees were conditional bonds whose enforceability depended on a proven contractor liability."
