The judgment is available online as\nS v\r\nSelebi\n(25/09) [2010] ZAGPJHC 53 (5 July 2010). In summary his\r\nconviction arose from his dealings with Mr Glen Norbet Agliotti and\r\nthe\nappeal is against the finding by the trial court that he had\r\nreceived certain payments and benefits in kind from Agliotti and\r\nprovided\nquid pro quo for such payments and/or benefits.\n[2] The appellant appeals to this\r\ncourt against conviction, but not sentence, with leave of both the\r\ncourt a quo and, in one respect,\nthis court (Nugent and Snyders JJA).\r\nLeave of the court a quo was limited to the question whether the\r\nState had proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt that the appellant had\r\nreceived payment from Agliotti. This court, on petition, extended it\r\nto include the question whether\n‘the State has proved that the\r\n[appellant] has provided Agliotti with any quid pro quo as a result\r\nof gratification received\nfrom Agliotti as envisaged in terms of\nSection 4\nof the\nPrevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act\n12 of 2004\n’.\n[3] The indictment alleged that\r\nat the relevant time there existed a corrupt relationship between the\r\nappellant and Agliotti. In\nterms of this relationship the appellant\r\nreceived from Agliotti sums of money and clothing for himself and, on\r\none occasion, for\nhis sons. It further alleged that the appellant\r\nreceived the aforementioned payment (gratification) in order to act\r\nin a manner\nprescribed in s 4(1)\n(a)\n(i)-(iv) of the PCCA Act\r\nand the appellant did so act by way of quid pro quo. As to the\r\ndetails thereof it was alleged that the\nappellant: (a) shared secret\r\ninformation with Agliotti regarding an investigation against him\r\nconducted by the United Kingdom law\nenforcement authorities; (b)\r\nprotected Agliotti from criminal investigation; (c) shared with\r\nAgliotti information about South African\nPolice Service (SAPS)\r\ninvestigations; (d) shared secret and/or confidential information\r\nwith him; (e) agreed to and/or attempted\nto influence the\r\ninvestigative and/or prosecutorial process against one Muller Conrad\r\nRautenbach; (f) shared with one Stephen Colin\nSanders and/or one\r\nClinton Nassif and others tender information relating to impending\r\ncontractual work to be performed in Sudan;\nand (g) assisted Agliotti\r\nand/or Agliotti’s associates to receive preferential or special\r\nSAPS services.\n[4] The appellant pleaded not\r\nguilty to the charge. In his plea explanation in terms of\ns 115\nof\r\nthe\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\nthe appellant alleged that the\r\nprosecution against him was not bona fide but was instituted with an\r\nulterior motive. He said that\nthe case against him was manipulated\r\nwith the mala fide intention to discredit him so as to ensure the\r\ncontinued existence of the\nDirectorate of Special Operations (DSO).\r\nThe DSO was at the time under threat of closure and placement within\r\nthe SAPS. The appellant\ndenied that he had received any payments or\r\ngifts from Agliotti, either for himself or for any other person. He\r\nmaintained that\nhe and Agliotti were friends, and nothing more.\n[5] The two key witnesses for the\r\nState on the question of payments and gifts to the appellant were\r\nAgliotti and Dianne Muller.\nThe credibility of these two witnesses\r\nwas severely attacked by the defence. Counsel contended that they had\r\nconspired to give\nfalse evidence against the appellant. Therefore,\r\nthe resolution of the question whether the appellant received payment\r\nand gifts\nfrom Agliotti and whether his conduct fell within the scope\r\nof the provisions of s 4(1)\n(a)\nof the PCCA Act is, in this\r\nappeal, depended upon the acceptance of the evidence of these two\r\nwitnesses. At the conclusion of the\ntrial the court accepted their\r\nevidence. Agliotti’s evidence was accepted only where it was\r\ncorroborated in material respects\nby Muller and other independent\r\nevidence. The court had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of\r\nMuller whom it found to be a\nsatisfactory witness.\nIssues on appeal\n[6] There are two issues to be\r\ndecided in this appeal. The first is whether the State succeeded in\r\nproving that the appellant received\npayments and/or other benefits\r\nfor himself and other people from Agliotti. The second is whether it\r\nproved that the appellant provided\nAgliotti with any quid pro quo for\r\nsuch payment or gratification received as required by s 4 of the PCCA\r\nAct. The question whether\nthe appellant received payment and/or other\r\nbenefits requires a consideration of whether he received such\r\ngratification with a\ncorrupt intention.\nThe law applicable\n[7] Corrupt activities by public\r\nofficers are punishable under s 4(1) of the PCCA Act, which reads as\r\nfollows:\n‘\n(1)\r\nAny─\n(a)\npublic\r\nofficer who, directly or indirectly,\naccepts\nor agrees or offers to accept\nany\ngratification from any other person\n,\r\nwhether for the benefit of himself or herself or for the benefit of\r\nanother person; or\n(b)\nperson\r\nwho, directly or indirectly, gives or agrees or offers to give any\r\ngratification to a public officer, whether for the benefit\nof that\r\npublic officer or for the benefit of another person,\nin order to act,\r\npersonally or by influencing another person so to act\n,\nin a manner\n─\nthat amounts to\r\n\tthe─\nillegal, dishonest,\r\n\tunauthorised, incomplete, or biased; or\nmisuse or selling\r\n\tof information or material acquired in the course of the,\nexercise, carrying\r\nout or performance of any powers, duties or functions arising out of\na constitutional , statutory, contractual or any other legal\r\nobligation;\nthat amounts to─\n(\naa\n) the\r\nabuse of a position of authority;\n(\nbb\n) a breach\r\nof trust; or\nthe violation of a\r\n\tlegal duty or a set of rules;\ndesigned to achieve\r\n\tan unjustified result; or\nthat amounts to any\r\n\tother unauthorised or improper inducement to do or not to do\r\n\tanything,\nis guilty of the\r\noffence of corrupt activities relating to public officers.’\n(Emphasis added.)\n[8] In this case we are concerned\r\nwith a public officer (the appellant) who accepted gratification\r\n(money and clothing) from a person\n(Agliotti), in return for\r\ninformation and favours. It is not in dispute that the appellant was\r\nat all relevant times a public officer.\nHe is alleged to be a\nrecipient\nand not a giver of the\r\ngratification referred to in s 4(1)\n(a)\nin order to act in a manner\r\nenvisaged in s 4(1)\n(a)\n(i)\r\nof the PCCA Act. The essential elements of the general crime of\r\ncorruption committed by a recipient are the following: (a) the\n\nacceptance; (b) of a gratification (payment or some other benefit);\r\n(c) in order to act in a certain way (the inducement); (d)\n\nunlawfulness; and (e) intention.\n1\nAlthough ‘unlawfulness’\r\nis not expressly mentioned in the definition of the crime,\r\ncommentators are of the view that\nit must nevertheless be read into\r\nit. It connotes that the act (in this case the acceptance of payment)\r\nshould be unjustified as\nthis is a requirement of every crime. In\r\ngeneral ‘unlawfulness’ means ‘contrary to the good\r\nmorals or the legal\nconvictions of society’\n2\n.\r\nThe same applies to ‘intention’. Therefore it has to be\r\nconsidered even though it is not specifically mentioned.\n[9] The first element\r\n(acceptance) is self explanatory and does not require any\r\nelucidation. As for the second element (gratification)\nit is said to\r\ninclude ‘money, whether in cash or otherwise’.\n3\nThe third element (inducement)\r\ndepends on whether receipt of the gratification is directed at\r\nprocuring the recipient to act in\none or more of the ways as set out\r\nin the subsection. I have dealt with ‘unlawfulness’. Just\r\nas with ‘unlawfulness’,\n‘intention’ referred\r\nto in (e) above, is not specifically mentioned in the definition\r\nsection of the PCCA Act but the\ndefinition must be construed as\r\nrequiring intention.\n4\nThe recipient must have the\r\nrequired intention at the moment he receives the gratification.\n5\nSnyman says:\n‘\n[I]ntention\r\nalways includes a certain knowledge, namely knowledge of the nature\r\nof the act, the presence of the definitional elements\nand the\r\nunlawfulness. A person has knowledge of a fact not only if she is\r\nconvinced of its existence, but also if she foresees\nthe possibility\r\nof the existence of the fact but is reckless towards it; in other\r\nwords she does not allow herself to be deterred\nby the possibility of\r\nthe existence of such fact. She then has intention in the form of\ndolus\r\neventualis\n.\n6\n’\nThe facts\n[10] I turn to payments\r\n(gratification), the benefits (quid pro quo) allegedly provided by\r\nthe appellant to Agliotti, such as the\nreports by the United Kingdom\r\nlaw enforcement authorities and the extent to which they indicate the\r\npresence or absence of corrupt\nintent on the part of the appellant.\nPayments\nThe investigation by KPMG\n[11] It is convenient to commence\r\nthe discussion of the question of payments by reference to an\r\ninvestigation by KPMG into the source\nof the funds from which\r\nAgliotti allegedly made payments to the appellant. The enquiry into\r\nhow the funds were channelled from\nJohannesburg Consolidated\r\nInvestments Limited (JCI) to Spring Lights 6 (Pty) Ltd (Spring\r\nLights) and from which Agliotti paid the\nappellant was amply covered\r\nby Joffe J in a detailed and careful judgment. I can do no better\r\nthan to borrow from his considered\nanalysis. He described this aspect\r\nof the enquiry as follows. In June 2006 JCI and Rand Gold and\r\nExploration Company Limited reported\ncertain suspected offences to\r\nthe DSO. KPMG was then appointed by the DSO to assist them in an\r\ninvestigation which was called ‘Empire\nK’. The Empire K\r\ninvestigation in turn led to a further investigation by KPMG which\r\nrelated to the appellant. KPMG was asked\nto analyse the appellant’s\r\nbank accounts, credit card accounts, investment accounts and foreign\r\ncurrency trades performed\nby him and on his behalf by the SAPS. They\r\nwere also asked, given a certain category of transactions identified\r\nby Agliotti in\na draft affidavit, to determine whether they could\r\nidentify any transaction with those characteristics in the bank\r\nstatements of\nSpring Lights and to determine the funding of Spring\r\nLights. Mr Dean Friedman, who conducted the investigation on behalf\r\nof KPMG,\ntestified that on 24 August 2005 Messrs Brett Kebble, Roger\r\nKebble, John Stratton and Hendrik Christoffel Buitendag resigned from\n\nthe Board of Directors of JCI. Thereafter a new board was appointed.\r\nThe new board instructed KPMG to perform an investigation\ninto JCI\r\nand its subsidiaries. In December 2005, as part of this\r\ninvestigation, difficulty was encountered with regard to payments\n\nmade to Spring Lights. An enquiry was sent to Agliotti on 19 January\r\n2006 in which he was requested to provide ‘a list of\n\nindividuals and/or entities who received payments during the course\r\nof [his] assignment’ and to indicate the total amount\nthat\r\nSpring Lights received from JCI directly and indirectly. He was also\r\nasked if he himself had received any payments from third\nparties who\r\neffected payment on behalf of JCI. The enquiry was responded to in\r\nApril 2006. In regard to payments received by individuals\nor entities\r\nduring the course of Agliotti’s assignment between 5 December\r\n2003 and 31 January 2005 are payments amounting\nto R2 224 186. The\r\nrecipients were not identified. What however became clear from the\r\ninvestigation was that Agliotti made payments\nof over R2 million to\r\nindividuals during that period.\n[12] The results of the KPMG\r\ninvestigation were compiled in a report entitled ‘Report on\r\nfactual findings’ dated 19\nMarch 2009. The judge went on to\r\ndescribe how the paper trail led to the appellant. The portion of the\r\nreport pertaining to him\nreflects the total income and expenditure as\r\nreflected in the appellant’s bank account for the period 13\r\nJanuary 2003 to\n4 January 2007. According to Friedman, and as it\r\nappeared from that report, the income in the appellant’s bank\r\naccount exceeded\nthe expenditure by R152 970.45. An amount of R400\r\n000 which was reflected as an item of expenditure was utilised by the\r\nappellant\nto acquire a unit trust investment for his own benefit.\r\nAccordingly, at the end of that period the appellant was better off\r\nthan\nat the commencement thereof by the value of the unit trust\r\ninvestment and the surplus of R152 970.45 received in his bank\r\naccount\nduring the relevant period (13 January 2003 to 4 January\r\n2007). The investigation involved an examination of alleged payments\r\nto\nthe appellant from cash drawn from the Spring Lights account,\r\ndetails of the transactions in the appellant’s bank account,\n\ndetails in the appellant’s two credit card accounts and the\r\nappellant’s and his wife’s foreign exchange transactions\n\nand the source of information in respect of the latter. The forensic\r\ninvestigation also involved a monthly comparison, for the\nperiod\r\nFebruary 2003 to December 2006, of receipts and expenditure from the\r\nappellant’s bank account and credit cards.\n[13] The investigation then\r\nproceeded to focus on the period March 2004 to December 2005 with\r\nregard to cheque payments made from\nthe appellant’s bank\r\naccount, cheques cashed on that account, cash withdrawals and the\r\nappellant’s credit card expenditure.\nIt revealed the following:\r\n(a) there were no cash withdrawals in January, February, March, June,\r\nJuly, October, November and December\n2005 from the appellant’s\r\nbank account; (b) no cheques were cashed on the account in April,\r\nMay, July, October and November\n2004 and from January 2005 to\r\nDecember 2005; (c) in January, February and October 2005 no cheque\r\npayments were made from that account;\n(d) there was a significant\r\nreduction in credit card expenditure in the months from January to\r\nApril 2005 and July 2005. For example\ncredit card expenditure was\r\nonly R465.35 in January 2005 and R188.12 in February 2005; (e) for\r\nthe ten-month period March to December\n2004, the total of cash\r\nwithdrawals from and cheques cashed on the account amounted to R126\r\n048. For the 12-month period from January\nto December 2005 the total\r\nof cash withdrawals and cheques cashed amounted to only R358; and (f)\r\nthe total expenditure from the\nappellant’s bank account for the\r\nperiod March to December 2004 amounted to R430 899.90. It only\r\namounted to R231 028.67 for\nthe period January to December 2005.\r\nAccording to Friedman the pattern of reduced expenditure continued\r\ninto 2006 and only started\npicking up during July 2006.\n[14] The trial judge then dealt\r\nwith the evidence of Friedman who identified seven such cheques that\r\ncorresponded to the allegations\nmade by Agliotti in his draft\r\naffidavit.

However, the trial court\r\nentertained a doubt as to whether the appellant received payment of\r\nthe proceeds of the\ncheque of R200 000 and gave the appellant the\r\nbenefit of that doubt. So do I.\n[16] During cross-examination\r\nFriedman was asked whether he had encountered Spring Lights account\r\ncheques or counterfoils to cheques\nin which reference was made to\r\nJohn Stratton either by name or by use of the initials ‘JS’.\r\nHe replied that he had\nno independent recollection of such cheques.\r\nHe was then asked to inspect Spring Lights’ cheques and\r\ncounterfoils to ascertain\nwhether there were any which referred to\r\nJohn Stratton as ‘JS’. Friedman did the exercise and\r\nfound three such cheques.\nThe cheques were made out to Monster\r\nMarketing CC. The first cheque no 159 dated 3 August 2004 was in the\r\namount of R182 274.30.\nThe cheque stub is annotated ‘JSMB’.\r\nThe second cheque, which is cheque no 193 dated 12 October 2004 was\r\nin the amount\nof R18 607.44. The cheque stub is annotated ‘JS\r\nCar’. The third cheque no 213 dated 1 December 2004 was in the\r\namount\nof R18 607.44. The cheque stub is annotated ‘Car JS’.\r\nIt is clear from the evidence of Friedman as set out above that\n\npayments that bore the initials ‘JS’ referred to payments\r\nto Stratton in respect of his motor vehicle. It is also clear\nthat\r\nthe amounts with which Agliotti was allegedly able to effect the\r\npayments, that are the subject of the dispute in this matter,\nwere\r\ndrawn from the Spring Lights account, which was used by JCI as a\r\ncorporate vehicle to channel funds to Agliotti.\nIndividual payments and gifts\n[17] I turn to a discussion of\r\nthe individual payments which the trial court found to have been\r\nproved against the appellant. These\nare:\n(a) R110 000;\n(b) R30 000 by means of a cheque\r\ndated 28 September 2005, the counterfoil of which indicates that it\r\nis payable to ‘Cash (Chief)’;\n(c) R10 000;\n(d) an unspecified amount of US\r\nDollars; and\n(e) gifts.\n(a)\nPayment\r\nof R110 000\n[18] The trial court’s\r\napproach to the question of payments was to accept that those\r\npayments were made to the appellant where\nthere was corroboration for\r\nAgliotti’s evidence, firstly, because of the credibility\r\nfinding made against him and secondly,\nbecause he was a single\r\nwitness in respect of some of the payments.\n7\nAs far as the two big payments of\r\nR200 000 and R120 000 are concerned the court found that there was no\r\ncorroboration for Agliotti’s\nevidence in respect of the payment\r\nof R200 000. There was however what the court described as potential\r\ncorroboration in respect\nof the payment of R120 000. The court then\r\nproceeded to deal with the first payment of R110 000. It bears\r\nmention that the payment\nof R110 000 was largely derived from the\r\nproceeds of a cheque for R100 000 dated 20 December 2004 which was\r\ndrawn to cash. The\ncounterfoil of the relevant cheque has the word\r\n‘CoP’ noted on it. The court found this to constitute\r\npotential corroboration\nfor the payment of R120 000. The note on the\r\ncounterfoil was made by Mr Martin Flint, the Chief Financial Officer\r\nof Spring Lights.\nAgliotti, in his evidence, pointed out that he\r\nassumed that ‘CoP’ referred to the appellant. The trial\r\ncourt dealt\nwith and analysed in detail the evidence of Flint in\r\nrespect of this cheque. Flint testified that when Agliotti asked for\r\na cash\ncheque he would furnish him with a brief description of the\r\npurpose of the cheque. Flint would make a note of this on the\r\ncounterfoil\nto enable him to identify the payment if Agliotti ever\r\nqueried it. Flint maintained that what was written on the counterfoil\r\nwas\nalways based upon that which Agliotti had told him. In respect of\r\nthe note ‘CoP’ Flint testified that he had no idea\nwhat\r\nit meant. During cross-examination he said he thought it related to a\r\nretired policeman called Bezuidenhout. Bezuidenhout\nhad suffered a\r\nserious accident and Agliotti had agreed to help him. Flint recalled\r\nthat the policeman concerned came to Maverick’s\n8\nold offices where he would be\r\ngiven payment. Flint however later recalled that at the time that\r\nthis particular cheque of R100 000\nwas made out Maverick had moved to\r\na new office. Flint had no recollection of Bezuidenhout calling at\r\nthe new premises to collect\ncheques.\n[19] Flint’s ignorance of\r\nthe origin and meaning of the annotation ‘CoP’ on the\r\ncounterfoil left the trial court\nwith the impression that he was\r\nendeavouring to exculpate himself from any wrongdoing. The court\r\nhowever found it significant that\nFlint associated the payment with a\r\npoliceman, or albeit the retired policeman, Bezuidenhout. Having\r\nregard to the probabilities\nthe court concluded that the counterfoil\r\nof the cheque for R100 000 which read ‘CoP’ was likely to\r\nrefer to the appellant\nand thus provided some corroboration for\r\nAgliotti’s evidence.\n[20] Secondly, the court found\r\nthat Muller’s evidence also provided corroboration for this\r\npayment having been made to the\nappellant. It is true that there are\r\nmany differences between the evidence of Agliotti and that of Muller\r\nin respect of this payment.\nFirstly, on Agliotti’s version\r\nFlint cashed the cheque and handed the R100 000 to Muller in the\r\noffices of Maverick before\nAgliotti had arrived at Maverick’s\r\npremises. Agliotti said he only handed Muller R20 000 in cash to add\r\nto the R100 000.\nThis is however contradicted by Muller. Muller\r\ntestified that Agliotti had handed her all the money which he had\r\ntaken from his\nbriefcase and that he had asked her to check that it\r\namounted to R110 000. Secondly, according to Agliotti an amount of\r\nR120 000\nwas handed over to the appellant in the boardroom. Muller is\r\nadamant that only R110 000 was handed over to the appellant. Thirdly,\n\nAgliotti made no mention of the fact that Muller had told him that\r\nshe had removed R10 000 from the money that she had counted.\nOn the\r\ncontrary, according to Agliotti he had wanted to give as much money\r\nas he had to the appellant. It was for that reason that\nhe added R20\r\n000. Fourthly, Agliotti testified that the money was paid to the\r\nappellant because the latter had informed Agliotti\nthat he had\r\nproblems. Muller testified that the money was paid over for a holiday\r\nfor the appellant and his family. Fifthly, Agliotti\ntestified that he\r\nhad arrived at Maverick and that shortly thereafter the appellant\r\narrived. Muller testified that the appellant\nhad arrived first and\r\nthat Agliotti had informed her prior to the arrival of the appellant\r\nthat the appellant would arrive first\nand that she should make coffee\r\nfor him whilst he waited.\n[21] The judge concluded that had\r\nMuller and Agliotti conspired with each other to give false evidence\r\nagainst the appellant these\ndifferences would have been avoided. He\r\nconcluded that their very presence, meaning differences, whilst\r\ncreating some possible\ndifficulty in regard to reliability or\r\ncogency, gave their evidence credibility. The differences were not so\r\nextensive as to render\nit impossible to make a finding that the\r\npayment had been made to the appellant.\n[22] It bears mention that the\r\ntrial judge was best placed to consider and assess the evidence. He\r\nhad the opportunity and the advantage\nof observing Muller when she\r\ntestified and to assess the credibility of the evidence with due\r\nregard to her demeanour in the witness\nbox. The learned judge noted\r\nthat when at the end of Muller’s cross-examination, it was put\r\nto her that the appellant denied\nthat he ever received payments from\r\nAgliotti, she turned her face looked directly at the appellant and\r\nsaid: ‘That is not\nthe truth’. The judge further observed\r\nthat Muller’s reaction did not appear to be contrived. It gave\r\nher evidence\nwhat the judge described as ‘the stamp of\r\ncredibility’. He concluded that despite all the criticism of\r\nher evidence\nthe stamp of credibility was justified and her evidence\r\nin general was accepted. There is no basis to interfere with that\r\nfinding.\n9\nThe judge accordingly found that\r\nMuller’s evidence does serve as corroboration of payment to the\r\nappellant. Agliotti testified\nthat the payment was R120 000. Muller\r\ntestified that the payment was R110 000. The court found that her\r\nevidence in respect of\nR110 000 was convincing and it was accordingly\r\nheld that her evidence was corroborative of the payment as testified\r\nby Agliotti\nup to that amount. The judge adopted a cautious approach,\r\nwhich has stood the test of time, and therefore he cannot be faulted\r\nin accepting the evidence of Agliotti where it was corroborated by\r\nindependent evidence.\n10\n[23] Additional corroboration for\r\nthe State’s case in respect of this payment is to be found in\r\nthe evidence of Friedman.\nHe testified in regard to the appellant’s\r\nbizarre spending pattern in the relevant period. In January 2005 the\r\ntotal amount\npaid out of the appellant’s bank account amounted\r\nto only R465.35 and in February 2005 to R188.12. No credible\r\nexplanation\nfor this was provided. The appellant’s wife, who\r\nwas said to be the person in charge of the household finances, was\r\nnot called\nas a witness to explain this. The absence of cash cheques\r\nor cash withdrawals also referred to in Friedman’s report was\r\nnot\nexplained. On the face of it the appellant must have had some\r\nother source of funds and the payments from Agliotti provide a\r\nplausible\nexplanation for his altered spending pattern.\n[24] The judge also found further\r\ncorroboration for this payment having been made by Agliotti to the\r\nappellant, in the appellant’s\nforeign currency transactions.\r\nThe appellant had received an advance for a visit to France in the\r\namount of R8 537.17 for his journey\non 3 June 2005. Notwithstanding\r\nthis the appellant utilised the sum of R13 064.15 to purchase euros.\r\nHowever, after the visit the\nappellant sold 680 euros at a rand value\r\nof R5 193.90 on 28 June 2005. The trial court found that the\r\nappellant had excess cash\nin his possession, which he was unable to\r\nexplain.\n[25] The judge then referred to\r\nanother foreign currency transaction. Here the appellant received an\r\nadvance of R8 954.81 for a\ntrip in July 2005. Notwithstanding this\r\nthe appellant utilised the sum of R21 796.65 to purchase $3 152 on 28\r\nJuly 2005. After\nthe visit the accused sold $2 237 at a rand value of\r\nR14 020.70 on 19 August 2005. It was found that the appellant had\r\nspent slightly\nless than his advance. He was once again unable to\r\nfurnish an explanation for his conduct. The court considered these\r\ntransactions\nto provide corroboration for Agliotti’s evidence\r\nthat the appellant had received payment of the amount of R110 000.\r\nConfronted\nwith the State’s case as set out above and having\r\nregard to the poor quality of the appellant’s evidence, the\r\ncourt\ncame to the conclusion that the appellant’s denial of\r\nreceipt of payment of R110 000 was not reasonably possibly true.\n(b)\nPayment of R30 000\n[26] The next payment in respect\r\nof which corroboration was found is the payment of R30 000 which\r\nrepresents the proceeds of a cheque\ndated 28 September 2005.\n[27] This cheque was dated the\r\nday after Brett Kebble died. The judge then dealt with how the amount\r\nwas paid to the appellant.\nIn re-examination Agliotti stated that on\r\nthe day after Kebble died, he had to go and identify Kebble’s\r\nbody. He did not\nknow where the mortuary was. He went to Nassif’s\r\noffice for assistance. Nassif instructed one of his employees, André\n\nBurger, to show Agliotti where the mortuary was. Whilst driving in\r\nthe car to the mortuary the appellant phoned Agliotti and asked\nfor\r\nmoney. Although counsel for the appellant initially objected to this\r\nevidence the objection was abandoned when cellular phone\nrecords were\r\nproduced which reflected the disputed call. There was a futile\r\nattempt to link the R30 000 to an Interpol dinner but\nthis floundered\r\nwhen it turned out that the dinner occurred in September 2004. The\r\npayment in dispute here had been made on 28\nSeptember 2005. The\r\nsuggestion by the defence that the R30 000 was in fact not paid to\r\nthe appellant but used by Agliotti as a\nclearance payment for a drug\r\ntransaction that he was involved in, was rejected by the court. The\r\ncounterfoil of the cheque reflects\n‘Chief’ and the fact\r\nthat the appellant was the only person who was referred to by\r\nAgliotti as Chief, makes nonsense\nof the latter suggestion. The court\r\naccepted that sufficient corroboration had been provided for the\r\npayment under this heading.\n(c)\nPayment of R10 000\n[28] The court was satisfied that\r\nthe counterfoil linked the payment of this cheque to the appellant.\r\nFlint originally linked this\npayment to another policeman. He however\r\nlater changed this in his evidence. The court concluded that the\r\ncounterfoil to the cheque\nserved as corroboration for Agliotti’s\r\nevidence. The cheque in question is dated 14 June 2004 and has\r\nannotated on it the\nwords ‘JSGA’. In the context of this\r\ncase the appellant is the only person who would fit the description\r\nof ‘JS’.\nThere is a compelling inference that ‘GA’\r\nrefers to Glen Agliotti. I have already referred to the unlikelihood\r\nthat\nthe retired policeman, Bezuidenhout or John Stratton might be\r\nthe person to whom these annotations refer. I find the reasoning of\n\nthe court and the conclusion to which it came in this respect to be\r\nbeyond reproach.\n(d)\nAn\r\nunspecified amount of US Dollars\n[29] Agliotti testified that he\r\npaid the appellant $30 000 in three payments. The one payment was\r\nmade in the first class lounge\nin the International Departure Hall at\r\nO R Tambo International Airport. The appellant denied receipt of this\r\npayment. Agliotti\nwas found to have received $100 000 on 22 April\r\n2005 from Mr Muller Conrad Rautenbach.\n11\nIn this regard it was put to the\r\nappellant that he went to Cyprus for an Interpol regional conference\r\nfrom 23 May 2005 to 28 May\n2005. The appellant received an advance in\r\nrespect of the expenses of this trip from the SAPS of 700 euros which\r\nwas acquired at\na cost of R5 900.75. On his return to South Africa\r\nthe appellant’s actual expenses were calculated to the sum of\r\nR6 223.62\nand claimed from the SAPS. This resulted in a nett amount\r\nof R322.87 being paid to the appellant. Included in the claim was an\r\namount of 508.99 euros or dollars in respect of accommodation. On his\r\nreturn to South Africa on 28 May 2005 and contrary to his\nnormal\r\npractice of allowing Ms Eunice Elizabeth Grové, his personal\r\nsecretary, to attend to his foreign currency transactions,\nthe\r\nappellant sold $2 500 at O R Tambo International Airport. This\r\noccurred one month after Agliotti had received the $100 000\nfrom\r\nRautenbach. When the appellant was asked to indicate where the\r\ndollars had come from, he could not do so. Instead, he furnished\na\r\nnumber of unsatisfactory responses. His first response was that he\r\nwould have received the foreign currency from the Cyprus trip.\nIt was\r\nthen pointed out to him that the advance of foreign currency for this\r\ntrip had been in euros. The appellant then changed\nhis version to say\r\nthat the advance was from Interpol. To avoid the suggestion that he\r\nhad been paid for the same expenditure by\nthe SAPS and Interpol, he\r\nstated that the SAPS advance was returned to the SAPS and the\r\nInterpol allowance was used. This was rightly\nrejected by the court\r\nas simply not true. The explanation was simply fanciful.\n[30] The court found that this\r\namounted to corroboration of Agliotti’s evidence that he gave\r\nthe appellant US Dollars albeit\nnot in the amount of $30 000. It held\r\nthat the State had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Agliotti paid\r\nan indeterminate amount\nin US Dollars to the appellant. I agree.\n(e)\nGifts\n[31] The question of gifts does\r\nnot appear to be covered by the leave granted by the court a quo,\r\nwhich refers only to payments.\nTo the extent that gifts constitute\r\n‘gratification’ as defined and for the sake of\r\ncompleteness a brief discussion\nwould, in my view, not do any harm to\r\nthe judgment. On the question of gifts the court found that there was\r\ncorroboration for Agliotti’s\nevidence that clothing was bought\r\nfor the appellant’s sons. Muller also testified in that regard.\r\nWhen it was put to her\nat the conclusion of her cross-examination\r\nthat the appellant denied that Agliotti ever purchased clothes at\r\nFubu for the appellant’s\nchildren she responded with conviction\r\nand whilst looking at the appellant said: ‘That is a lie’.\r\nThe appellant did\nnot seek to place the evidence of his wife or sons\r\nbefore the court in this regard. The court finally concluded that the\r\nState\nsucceeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant\r\nreceived payments and gifts from Agliotti to the extent indicated\nin\r\nits judgment.\nBenefits / Quid pro quo\n[32] This aspect of the case\r\nfalls within the extension of leave granted by this court. The\r\nquestion to be considered here is whether\nthe appellant provided\r\nAgliotti with any quid pro quo for the payments made to him by\r\nAgliotti as required by s 4(1)\n(a)\n(i)\r\nof the PCCA Act. The trial court identified four instances that\r\nconstituted such quid pro quo. The first was a UK report which\nthe\r\nappellant showed to Agliotti. Commissioner Martin Hankel, then a\r\nSection Head of Intelligence in the SAPS, gave evidence in\nrelation\r\nto a number of UK reports. He said that he was requested to identify\r\nall the reports that could be found pertaining to\nAgliotti. There\r\nwere six such reports in total, according to the SAPS, where there\r\nwas either content that related to Agliotti\nor a reference to\r\nAgliotti. His evidence was not challenged by the appellant. Neither\r\nwas the evidence tendered by Agliotti in\nthis regard challenged. He\r\ntestified that he was shown a document by the appellant. The\r\nappellant asked him to read it and he thereafter\nquestioned Agliotti\r\nabout his knowledge of and relationship with the people mentioned in\r\nthe report. The appellant then told Agliotti\nthat he (Agliotti) was\r\n‘being monitored or [his] movements were’. Agliotti\r\ntestified that the report that he was shown\nhad a particular\r\nappearance. According to him it bore a coat of arms and ‘either\r\na HSM or Her Majesty’s customs something\nto that effect’.\r\nIt cannot be disputed that one of the reports that was placed before\r\nthe court, has a coat of arms and the\nwords ‘HM Customs and\r\nExcise’ in bold print on it and refers to Agliotti in the\r\ncontext of an investigation into possible\ncriminal conduct on his\r\npart. As to the purpose of being shown the document, Agliotti\r\ntestified that the appellant wanted him to\nknow that the UK\r\nauthorities were monitoring his movements. I agree with this finding.\n[33] In its assessment of the\r\nevidence pertaining to this document the court observed that the UK\r\nreport was not the type of document\nthat the man in the street would\r\nhave knowledge of. The document was at all times in the possession of\r\nthe SAPS. There is no suggestion\nthat Agliotti could have gained\r\nknowledge of the existence and the content of the document from any\r\nsource other than a source\nconnected to the SAPS. Whilst Agliotti\r\ncould not recall the content of the document completely accurately,\r\nhis recollection of\nthe content and appearance thereof was considered\r\nby the court to be sufficient to establish that the document I have\r\ndescribed\nwas the document that was shown to him.\n[34] On the evidence the\r\nconclusion is unavoidable that the only person who could have shown\r\nthe document to Agliotti is the appellant.\nThis conclusion was\r\narrived at notwithstanding the comments made in respect of Agliotti’s\r\ngeneral credibility and the fact\nthat he was a single witness. The\r\ncourt concluded that there was sufficient corroboration for\r\nAgliotti’s evidence in this\nregard. The appellant’s\r\ndenial that he permitted Agliotti to read the UK report was therefore\r\nconsidered by the court not\nto be reasonably possibly true. I cannot\r\nfind fault with the reasoning of the trial judge.\n[35] Counsel for the appellant\r\nargued that Agliotti would not have benefitted from being shown the\r\nHMS document as he was already\nreferred to in the press as an\r\ninternational drug dealer. While the trial court accepted this to be\r\nso, it held that Agliotti could\nstill benefit from being warned that\r\nthe United Kingdom police were investigating him. To tell someone\r\ninvolved in criminal activities\nthat the police in two countries are\r\ninterested in his movements, will serve to put him on his guard and\r\npotentially cause him\nto take additional precautions as not to permit\r\nhis activities to be uncovered. The inference is inevitable that by\r\nshowing Agliotti\nthe document the appellant warned Agliotti of the\r\ninterest the United Kingdom authorities had in him and the fact that\r\ntheir interest\nwas known to the SAPS as well. The trial court found\r\nthat the appellant had showed the UK document to Agliotti for the\r\nbenefit\nof Agliotti. I agree with that conclusion.\n[36] The second benefit that\r\nAgliotti allegedly received from the appellant related to the\r\nNational Intelligence Estimate (NIE report).\nThis document indicated\r\nthat Jurgen Kögl, a businessman, was gathering information on\r\nthe supposed illegal activities of the\nappellant. Kögl alleged\r\nthat the appellant received large sums of money from the Kebbles\r\nemanating from questionable business\ndeals concluded on his behalf.\r\nThe document concerned was described as the 2005 NIE report. In his\r\nevidence the appellant admitted\nthat he showed a document to Agliotti\r\nthat contained a reference to Kögl. He explained that the reason\r\nhe did so was to show\nAgliotti the name of Jurgen Kögl. He was\r\nconcerned that he would not remember the spelling. The court rejected\r\nthis flimsy\nexplanation. There is no reason why the name could not\r\nhave been noted on a piece of paper if the only reason for showing\r\nAgliotti\nthis was because the appellant could not remember the\r\nspelling. The court found that the appellant shared this information\r\nwith\nAgliotti to enable Agliotti and the Kebbles to take steps to\r\nprotect themselves. Accordingly, the portion of the NIE document was\n\nshown to Agliotti for the benefit of Agliotti and the Kebbles. The\r\nappellant’s evidence that he showed a document to Agliotti\n\nprovides, in itself, corroboration for Agliotti’s evidence that\r\nthe appellant showed him a document and moreover, corroboration\nthat\r\nthe document had to do with Jurgen Kögl.\n[37] The third document found to\r\nhave been showed to Agliotti by the appellant was an e-mail that\r\ncontained a statement by one Bill\nSmith implicating Agliotti in\r\ncertain drug activities. It also referred to a meeting of members of\r\nthe Scorpions at which a Mr\nPaul O’Sullivan was present.\r\nAgliotti stated that the appellant handed him an e-mail which the\r\nappellant said provided proof\nthat O’Sullivan was behind the\r\nmedia campaign against him and that Agliotti should hand it to his\r\nlawyer so that he could\ntake the necessary legal steps against\r\nO’Sullivan. Thereafter, Agliotti benefitted by being placed in\r\npossession of this\ndocumentation.\n[38] The fourth benefit\r\nidentified, by the court that Agliotti received from the appellant,\r\nwas his ability to secure the attendance\nof the appellant at dinners\r\nand meetings where his presence was requested. The appellant did not\r\nchallenge Agliotti’s evidence\nin this respect. It was\r\nAgliotti’s evidence that he arranged meetings or dinners\r\nbetween the appellant and the Kebbles and\ntheir associates; between\r\nthe appellant and James Tidmarsh, Rautenbach’s lawyer; between\r\nthe appellant and Nassif when the\nJumean issue was raised; and\r\nbetween the appellant and Gavin Varejes with whom he had business\r\ndealings. This was also not challenged.\nAfter the hearing of the\r\napplication for a discharge of the appellant at the end of the State\r\ncase the appellant advanced a different\ncase to that which his\r\ncounsel had put forward until then. Firstly, he said that the he\r\nresisted Agliotti’s request to eat\nwith the Kebbles for two\r\nyears. Secondly, he claimed that it was he who called the meeting\r\nwith Tidmarsh and thirdly, it was Nassif\nthat had arranged the Jumean\r\nmeeting directly with him. The court rejected all of this and found\r\nthat the appellant could be and\nwas made available through Agliotti.\r\nThis was the reason why Rautenbach paid Agliotti $100 000 after\r\noriginally refusing to do\nso. As Rautenbach put it, Agliotti had at\r\nleast managed to raise Rautenbach’s issues with the appellant.\r\nThis was valued\nat $100 000. Accordingly, this was considered by the\r\ncourt to be a benefit to Agliotti. The court found that the meetings\r\nbetween\nthe appellant and the Kebbles were arranged by Agliotti. It\r\nfound that it was inconceivable that the appellant would have been\r\nwilling to be in the company of the Kebbles and their associates, let\r\nalone have dinner with them. The appellant knew the Kebbles\nwere\r\nsubjected to police monitoring. The court found that the meetings\r\nwere arranged by Agliotti and attended by the appellant.\nThey were\r\nnot attended out of friendship but because the appellant was\r\nobligated to go to them by reason of the payments made to\nhim by\r\nAgliotti. The court held that the State accordingly proved the\r\nbenefits to Agliotti and that such benefits were provided\nby the\r\nappellant. In my view the reasoning and the conclusion reached by the\r\ntrial court is compelling and I find it acceptable.\nIntention / mens rea\n[39] I turn to consider the\r\nquestion whether the State succeeded in proving beyond reasonable\r\ndoubt that the payments were received\nfrom Agliotti and any quid pro\r\nquo was afforded with the requisite mens rea. I have already alluded\r\nto the fact that s 4(1)\n(a)\n(i)\r\nof the PCCA Act does not specifically refer to intention but rather\r\nuses the words ‘in order to act, personally or by\ninfluencing\r\nanother person so to act . . .’. According to Burchell these\r\nwords at least import some ‘intention’\nelement. Besides,\r\nthere is a presumption in our law that mens rea is required for a\r\ncontravention of a statutory provision.\n12\nIn the case of a contravention of\r\ns 4 of the PCCA Act the legislature has made it easier for the State\r\nto prove the presence of\n‘intention’. Section 24 of the\r\nPCCA Act provides that once the prosecution has proved that\r\ngratification (payment)\nwas accepted or agreed and the State can show\r\nthat despite having taken reasonable steps, it was not able with\r\nreasonable certainty\nto link the acceptance of the gratification to a\r\nlawful authority or excuse on the part of the person charged, and in\r\nthe absence\nof evidence to the contrary which raises reasonable\r\ndoubt, it is sufficient evidence that the person charged accepted\r\nsuch gratification\nof that person ‘in order to act’ in a\r\nmanner envisaged in s 4 of the PCCA Act. The provisions relate to a\r\nrebuttable\npresumption of mens rea, including knowledge of\r\nunlawfulness, which is rebuttable by the person charged.\n[40] In the present matter there\r\nis no need to invoke the presumption contained in s 24 of the PCCA\r\nAct given the abundance of evidence\nfrom which a corrupt intention\r\ncan be inferred. On his own evidence the appellant knew as early as\r\nAugust 2003 that Agliotti was\nusing his name to get money from the\r\nKebbles. He knew that Brett Kebble had a problem with the South\r\nAfrican Revenue Service. He\nalso knew that Agliotti was the kind of\r\nperson that would use this relationship to benefit himself\r\nfinancially and yet he continued\nto go to Agliotti and to associate\r\nwith him.\n[41] There is also the question\r\nof the appellant’s assertion in evidence that he knew that if a\r\n‘hustler’ like\nAgliotti gave him anything he would\r\nimmediately know that it was for an illegal purpose. He added that if\r\nAgliotti made any payment\nto him he would know that he intended to\r\ninduce him to afford him some favours in one way or another. This\r\nconcession is illustrated\nin the following passage during\r\ncross-examination:\n‘\n.\r\n. . What I am saying is, if it happened that Mr Agliotti gave you R50\r\n000 and you took it, that would have been wrong? --- That\nwould have\r\nbeen wrong to me.\nWhy? --- Because it\r\nis an inappropriate thing to do.\nEspecially if you\r\nare the Head of the police? --- Yes.\nAnd you would know\r\nthat if a man, and I can take you through the record, you said, but\r\nif it is necessary, if a man like Agliotti,\na hustler would offer you\r\nmoney you would thin[k] there is something behind this, am I right?\r\n--- I would think so.\nHe is trying to buy\r\nmy favour or do something if he offered me a large amount of money,\r\nam I right, that would have been your story?\n--- Yes.’\n[42] Clearly in these\r\ncircumstances there can be no question that once it was proved that\r\nthe appellant received payments from Agliotti,\nthe inference was\r\nirresistible that it was for an illegal purpose and with knowledge of\r\nthat illegal purpose. It follows therefore\nthat the court having\r\naccepted that payments took place, found that the State had succeeded\r\nin establishing beyond reasonable doubt\nthat the payments were\r\naccepted by the appellant with the requisite corrupt intention.\n[43] It is also clear from the\r\nway the appellant dealt with Agliotti that he would not have believed\r\nthat he was acting lawfully.\nThe visits to Maverick to collect\r\npayments took place during office hours. Whenever the appellant\r\nvisited there he was not accompanied\nby any of his colleagues from\r\nthe police. Secondly, the UK reports that were shown to Agliotti were\r\ndone without Hankel’s\nknowledge or consent. The appellant\r\noffered no explanation why a National Commissioner had to exhibit\r\ndocuments to a person of\nquestionable repute. Thirdly, in none of the\r\nmeetings with the Kebbles, Agliotti and their associates were any of\r\nthe appellant’s\ncolleagues present. Fourthly, one of the\r\ndocuments, namely the e-mail, was shown to Agliotti at a parking lot\r\noutside Makro in\nWoodmead. If there was nothing wrong with the\r\ntransaction it is not clear why Agliotti was not called to the\r\nappellant’s\noffice and shown the document there. All of the\r\nabove are in my view further indicators that the appellant knew that\r\nwhat he was\ndoing was wrong and provide sufficient proof of his\r\nguilty state of mind.\nConclusion\n[44] There can therefore be no\r\nquestion that the State succeeded in proving the guilt of the\r\nappellant beyond reasonable doubt and\nthe court a quo was justified\r\nin convicting the appellant of corruption in contravention of s\r\n4(1)\n(a)\nof\r\nthe PCCA Act.\n[45] In the result the following\r\norder is made:\nThe appeal is dismissed.\n______________________\nK K MTHIYANE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\nSNYDERS JA (LEACH JA\r\nconcurring)\n[46] I have had the benefit of\r\nreading the judgment of Mthiyane DP. I agree with the conclusion that\r\nhe arrives at, however, I have\ntaken a specific view of this matter\r\nthat needs to be stated separately.\n[47] At the outset it is\r\nnecessary to supply a short sketch to explain the context of\r\ndifferent personalities mentioned in relation\nto the instances of\r\ncorruption that the appellant were convicted of in the court below.\r\nThe point of commencement is the appellant.\nHe was the National\r\nCommissioner of Police in South Africa for the period during which\r\nthe charges arose and also, since October\n2004, the President of\r\nInterpol. During this entire period he had a close relationship with\r\none Agliotti, an individual who had\nno particular occupation, but\r\ndescribed himself as a businessman who busied himself at times with a\r\nform of import and export and\nthe clearing of containers. He was\r\nalso, from his own mouth, a drug dealer, having pleaded guilty to\r\nsuch a charge during 2006.\nThe true nature of their relationship is\r\nsomething I return to later in this judgment. Agliotti also had a\r\nclose relationship with\nBrett Kebble, a businessman who, with his\r\nfather Roger Kebble (the Kebbles), was the director of several mining\r\ncompanies, including\nJohannesburg Consolidated Investments Ltd (JCI).\r\nJohn Stratton was one of the directors of JCI and, according to\r\nAgliotti, a close\nconfidant of Brett Kebble. The Kebbles bought a\r\ncompany from Martin Flint called Spring Lights Co (Pty) Ltd (Spring\r\nLights) and\nused its bank account to make money available to Agliotti\r\nto perform a variety of tasks for them. Flint was kept on as the\r\nfinancial\ndirector of Spring Lights. He is the father of Diane\r\nMuller, Agliotti’s fiancé during the relevant period.\r\nMuller\nconducted her own very successful events organising business,\r\ninitially known as Monster Marketing CC, from offices that were\r\nshared\nby both Agliotti and Flint. Flint was the accounting officer\r\nfor Monster Marketing CC. Clinton Nassif was closely connected to\r\nAgliotti and the Kebbles. He conducted private investigations and\r\nprovided security services, varying in nature, for the Kebbles.\nBilly\r\nRautenbach was a businessman in South Africa who was under\r\ninvestigation by the since disbanded Directorate of Special\r\nOperations\n(DSO), known as the Scorpions, for a variety of alleged\r\ncommercial crimes, who left South Africa when a warrant for his\r\narrest\nwas issued. Tidmarsh is a Swiss attorney who acted for\r\nRautenbach. Bulelani Ngcuka was the former National Director of\r\nPublic Prosecutions\nduring the time of the investigation of the case\r\nagainst Rautenbach. Ngcuka was succeeded by Vusi Pikoli who filled\r\nthat position\nduring the time that the case against the appellant was\r\ninvestigated until shortly before the appellant was arrested.\n[48] The appellant was charged\r\nwith a broad range of alleged instances of corruption committed\r\nduring his term as National Commissioner\nof Police, consisting of the\r\nreceipt of money, gifts and favours from Agliotti in return for\r\nprotection, favours and information.\nHe was convicted of four\r\ninstances of receiving money and one of receiving clothing for his\r\ntwo sons. The trial court found that\nthe appellant gave quid pro quo\r\nfor what he received from Agliotti, in the form of imparting\r\ninformation to Agliotti by showing\nhim three different documents and\r\nby attending dinners and meetings at Agliotti’s request.\n[49] Agliotti was the main\r\nwitness against the appellant. The general gist of his evidence was\r\nthat he had made several payments\nto the appellant, which the latter\r\nreceived. The trial court found his evidence to have been unreliable.\r\nThe appellant testified\nin his own defense and his testimony was\r\nfound to have been substantially dishonest. One witness, Muller,\r\nstood out during the\ntrial as honest and reliable. The trial court\r\nconvicted the appellant on the basis of objective corroboration for\r\nAgliotti’s\nevidence. In this court the credibility findings by\r\nthe trial court are not attacked except in respect of Muller.\r\nTherefore the\nissues in this appeal are: first, did the trial court\r\nerr in finding Muller a credible witness, and second, did the trial\r\ncourt\nerr in concluding that there was sufficient corroboration for\r\nAgliotti’s version to have established the appellant’s\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n[50] Muller’s evidence was\r\nattacked on three bases: first, that she had contradicted herself;\r\nsecond, that she had a vested\ninterest to support Agliotti’s\r\nevidence; and third, that she and Agliotti conspired to falsely\r\nincriminate the appellant.\nIt is evident from the judgment of the\r\ntrial court and the heads of argument on behalf of the appellant in\r\nthis appeal, that the\ncriticisms by the appellant of Muller’s\r\nevidence is no different in this court than it was in the trial\r\ncourt. The judgment\nby the trial court convincingly answers each and\r\nevery one of those criticisms and the appellant failed, in this\r\ncourt, either\nin the heads of argument or during argument, to\r\nindicate any errors made by the trial court in that regard. It is\r\ntherefore hardly\nnecessary to go into any particular depth on this\r\nissue. Such an exercise would amount to mere repetition of what has\r\nbeen thoroughly\ncanvassed.\n[51] It is trite that this court\r\nwill not lightly interfere with a credibility finding of a trial\r\ncourt.\n13\nThere is nothing in the record\r\nthat suggests that the trial court was wrong in its conclusion. The\r\nalleged contradiction in her\nevidence, the only one pointed to, is\r\nnot real. A careful reading of the record illustrates that she only\r\ntestified about one specific\nincident that sustains the inference\r\nthat the appellant received a specific direct payment from Agliotti.\r\nShe never tried to suggest\nshe saw other such instances and never\r\nsuggested that she saw the appellant leave Agliotti’s office\r\nwith an envelope that\ncould possibly have contained money. The\r\nsubmission that she contradicted herself is unfounded.\n[52] Her alleged vested interest\r\nin Agliotti which the appellant suggests motivated her to have lied,\r\nis based on the following\nfacts: she was also the recipient of money\r\nfrom the Spring Lights account; she is his former girlfriend; she\r\nremained friendly\nwith Agliotti even after they terminated their\r\nrelationship; and continued to travel together. Although this\r\ncriticism is based\non fact, the submission that the facts motivated\r\nan inclination to lie was at no stage apparent during the trial. On\r\nthe contrary,\nduring her evidence she dispelled any possible basis\r\nfor such an inference. She was running a highly successful and\r\nprofitable\nbusiness and was not in any way dependant on Agliotti for\r\nincome, and the amounts she did receive from Spring Lights were not\r\ngratuitous\npayments but the fulfillment of promises made by Agliotti\r\narising out of their relationship. She said she had no reason to\r\nbecome\nhis enemy after they split up and their continued travels\r\nsuited them both. The submission on behalf of the appellant is\r\nopportunistic\nand contrary to the essence of her evidence.\n[53] A conspiracy between\r\nAgliotti and Muller finds no support in the facts. The trial court\r\ncorrectly pointed to the fallacy of\nsuch an argument: that there was\r\nno opportunity for such conspiracy (this will become apparent later\r\nin this judgment), that the\nmany discrepancies between them is\r\ndestructive of any conclusion that they conspired, and that neither\r\nof them at any stage illustrated\nan inclination to incriminate the\r\nappellant. On the contrary, Agliotti adamantly insisted, to the very\r\nend, that he never ‘bribed’\nthe appellant.\n[54] There exists no basis on\r\nwhich this Court is entitled to interfere with the credibility\r\nfinding by the trial court in relation\nto Muller’s evidence.\n[55] During November 2006\r\nAgliotti was arrested as a suspect in the murder of Brett Kebble.\r\nOnce in jail he was anxious to be released\non bail. One route open to\r\nhim was to provide the investigating and prosecuting authorities with\r\nuseful information as a bargaining\ntool to obtain his release. For\r\nthis purpose he started compiling notes in point and word form about\r\npayments made to the appellant\nand the quid pro quo received from the\r\nappellant. When he made these notes he had no access to any\r\ndocumentation that he could\ndraw information from or use to stimulate\r\nhis memory. He also had no contact whatsoever with Muller.\r\nSignificantly there was no\ninvestigation of the appellant at this\r\nstage. Objective evidence at the trial corroborated some of the\r\ncontents of these notes\nand illustrate why the trial court was\r\njustified in its conclusion that there was not only no opportunity\r\nfor a conspiracy between\nAgliotti and Muller, but no actual\r\nconspiracy.\n[56] Agliotti testified about the\r\nnature of the relationship that he had with the appellant. According\r\nto him they were close friends.\nHe described himself as a generous\r\nperson who spontaneously gave gifts to people that he encountered a\r\nfact that was confirmed\nby the appellant. As the appellant was a\r\nclose friend of Agliotti, he also benefitted from that same\r\ngenerosity. However, in that\nrelationship the generosity took on a\r\nwhole new dimension. In the appellant’s own words, Agliotti was\r\na person constantly\nin need of recognition, and he therefore flaunted\r\nhis close relationship with the appellant. This close relationship\r\nwith the appellant\nenabled Agliotti to secure a fee of R12 million\r\nfrom the Kebbles with the assurance to them that the appellant was\r\n‘on board’.\nThis evidence was unchallenged and clearly\r\nreveals that the co-operation of the appellant came with a\r\nsubstantial price tag. Clearly\nthe Kebbles indulged in activities\r\nthat required the co-operation of the appellant outside his normal\r\nduties as chief of police\nand for that they were prepared to pay\r\nsubstantial money. Agliotti was able to offer the co-operation of the\r\nappellant, whether\nreal or illusory, because of the close\r\nrelationship that he enjoyed with him. Against this background\r\nAgliotti testified to numerous\npayments of various amounts that he\r\nmade to the appellant. This occurred over a period of years and, by\r\nthe very nature of such\npayments, no record of them was kept.\r\nUnderstandably, he was vague about the details.\n[57] Muller corroborated Agliotti\r\nabout the nature of the relationship between him and the appellant.\r\nShe was not a witness to most\nof the details regarding payments to\r\nthe appellant, but heard about them from Agliotti. She did, however,\r\ntestify to numerous instances\nthat she was asked by Agliotti to\r\nprepare envelopes containing amounts of money. On many of the\r\nenvelopes she was instructed to\nwrite the initials JS. She assumed,\r\nbut did not know, that it referred to the appellant. However, the\r\nappellant always called at\ntheir offices or sent his driver soon\r\nafter such envelopes were prepared. Although she never saw the\r\nappellant receive such an\nenvelope, she was convinced the money was\r\nfor him.\n[58] The use of the initials JS\r\nbecame a point of intense debate. The suggestion on behalf of the\r\nappellant, based on the evidence\nby Flint, was that it could also\r\nhave referred to John Stratton. Flint testified that, not having\r\nknown whose initials J S were,\nhe assumed it was John Stratton as\r\nthey had frequent dealings with Stratton at that stage as Muller and\r\nFlint, on behalf of Monster\nMarketing CC, were busy negotiating a\r\nblack economic empowerment (BEE) deal with the Kebbles and Stratton\r\non behalf of JCI. He\nalso said that Stratton, wanted to buy a new car\r\nbut required bridging finance. He asked that the deposit on the car\r\nand some of\nthe initial monthly payments be made from the Spring\r\nLights account. They obliged as it was the intention that Monster\r\nMarketing\nwould become a JCI entity after the BEE deal had been\r\nconcluded. The deal then fell through. An investigation by a firm of\r\nchartered\naccountants revealed three cheques that accorded with this\r\nevidence. They were dated 3 August 2004, 12 October 2004 and 1\r\nDecember\n2004 respectively. Not one of them is part of the payments\r\nthat the appellant has been charged with. The first cheque is made\r\nout\nto Monster Marketing in an amount of R182 274.30. Its stub refers\r\nto JSMB and Nedbank. This information is clearly reconcilable\nwith a\r\npayment of a deposit on a Mercedes Benz motor vehicle for John\r\nStratton. The second and third cheques are for the same amount,\nR18\r\n607.44, made out in favour of Monster Marketing, and the stubs of\r\nboth refer to ‘JS Car’. This information is clearly\n\nreconcilable with the payment of two installments on John Stratton’s\r\ncar.\n[59] The contrast between these\r\ncheques and those the trial court accepted as corroboration for\r\npayments made to the appellant will\nbecome evident as the evidence is\r\ndiscussed. Suffice it to say at this stage that all of the cheques\r\nthat the trial court accepted\nas corroborating evidence were made out\r\nto cash, in round figures and were not made out at regular intervals.\n[60] The trial court, faced with\r\nthe absence of reliable, detailed evidence from Agliotti, exercised\r\nwhat can only be described\nas extreme caution and only convicted the\r\nappellant on the basis of a few payments for which clear\r\ncorroboration existed.\n[61] Agliotti’s prison\r\nnotes refer to payment of R300 000 to the appellant. It was\r\nunchallenged that when he consulted with\nhis counsel about these\r\nnotes, the latter, as a result of the content of the consultation,\r\nmade his own notes on the same paper.\nAbove the amount of R300 000\r\ncounsel wrote ‘split trace cheques – Martin’ (the\r\nreference to Martin clearly being\nto Flint). The cheques were\r\nsubsequently traced and two cash cheques were found that was made out\r\nduring December 2004, one for\nR100 000 and one for R200 000. Agliotti\r\ntestified that the proceeds of the R100 000 cheque, which he\r\ninstructed Flint to draw,\nwere paid to the appellant. He added R20\r\n000 to it and asked Muller to pack it into an envelope, which he\r\nhanded to the appellant\nin the boardroom of Muller’s business\r\npremises. The trial court concluded that the money from the R100 000\r\ncheque was paid\nto the appellant. Before looking at the details of\r\nthe cheque, Muller’s evidence provides an important focus.\n[62] Muller testified to a cash\r\npayment of R110 000 by Agliotti to the appellant at her offices\r\nduring December 2004. Shortly stated,\nthe details of her evidence is\r\nthat, towards the end of 2004 Agliotti handed her a large amount of\r\ncash and told her to pack R110\n000 of it into a bank bag. On counting\r\nthe money she found it amounted to R120 000. She therefore\r\nremoved R10 000 and packed\nthe rest as he asked her to do. She then\r\ntook the packed money into the board room where the appellant was\r\nsitting with Agliotti\nand handed the bag to Agliotti, who pushed it\r\nacross the table towards the appellant. Points of difference between\r\nAgliotti and\nMuller relate to surrounding events that easily arise\r\nand, as the trial judge remarked, are indicative of the absence of a\r\nconspiracy\nto falsely incriminate the appellant.\n[63] The differences between them\r\npale further into insignificance when the next bit of corroboration\r\nis considered. Unrelated to\nthe investigation against the appellant,\r\nthe shareholders of JCI instructed the firm of chartered accountants,\r\nKPMG, to conduct\na forensic investigation into the Kebble’s\r\nmanagement of JCI. During this investigation the Spring Lights\r\naccount came under\nthe spotlight as it was the channel through which\r\nthe Kebbles allegedly channeled vast amounts of money to sometimes\r\nundisclosed\nand often unauthorized recipients. The DSO and\r\nprosecuting authorities ultimately benefited from this investigation\r\nin that it\nidentified several cash cheques, the stubs of which drew\r\nattention because they could be tied to payments made to the\r\nappellant.\nAll of these stubs contain an inscription that could be a\r\nreference to the appellant, being ‘JS’, the initials of\r\nthe\nappellant, ‘Chief’, being a shortened reference to\r\nthe appellant as chief of the police, and ‘COP’, being\nan\r\nabbreviation for the appellant as the chief of police.\n[64] Amongst these cheques was\r\none, dated 20 December 2004, in respect of which the stub read ‘CASH\r\nCoP’. On behalf\nof the appellant there was a desperate attempt\r\nto illustrate that ‘CoP’ could have referred to another\r\nor other policeman.\nThere was no suggestion that it could have\r\nreferred to anything unrelated to a member of the police force.\r\nEvidence was elicited\nduring cross-examination of a generous and kind\r\nhearted Agliotti that financially assisted a policeman with the\r\nsurname Bezuidenhout\nwho had a car accident during which he wrecked\r\nhis car. Agliotti’s own version was that he assisted\r\nBezuidenhout ‘in\na small way because [he] felt sorry for them’.\r\nR100 000 is hardly a small amount and it was never suggested that it\r\nwas.\n[65] Flint, who wrote out most of\r\nthe cheques drawn on the Spring Lights account, made a statement that\r\nthe money from at least\ntwo of the cheques was intended for\r\nBezuidenhout. During evidence he changed this evidence and explained\r\nthat he had since remembered\nthat the money that was paid to\r\nBezuidenhout was fetched by the latter at premises occupied by\r\nMuller, Flint and Agliotti prior\nto June 2004 and that the cheques\r\nunder discussion were dated after June 2004. He thus concluded that\r\nthe cheques could not have\nbeen for Bezuidenhout.\n[66] In isolation the evidence\r\nabout money paid to Bezuidenhout and Flint’s contradiction\r\nabout at least two of the cheques\nhaving been for Bezuidenhout, could\r\nhave had a significant effect in favour of the appellant’s\r\ndefence. However, in the context\nof all the other evidence, it does\r\nnot. The amount of the cheque goes way beyond generosity and kind\r\nheartedness. Taken with the\nevidence of Agliotti and Muller and the\r\nfurther corroboration to be discussed, it is not reasonably possible\r\nthat the moneys went\nto Bezuidenhout.\n[67] Before mentioning further\r\ncorroboration in relation to this payment of R110 000, it is\r\nconvenient at this stage to dwell on\nthe meaning of the words written\r\non the cheque stubs. Much was made on behalf of the appellant of the\r\nfact that Flint was the author\nof most of the cheques and cheque\r\nstubs, and he testified that he never suspected that the money was\r\nmeant for the appellant. Counsel\nfor the appellant argued that as the\r\nauthor of the stubs were unable to say that the money was meant for\r\nthe appellant it cannot\nbe concluded that the words on the cheque\r\nstubs referred to the appellant. This argument is fallacious. Flint\r\ntestified that he\nwrote out cheques on Agliotti’s instructions.\r\nHe had no independent knowledge of what the money was intended for.\r\nWhat he\nwrote on the stubs was based on information from Agliotti and\r\nwas meant to be a cryptic reminder of what the money was for. Flint\n\nwas therefore not the author of the stubs in the usual sense of the\r\nword. Although it was by his hand that the writing was made\non the\r\nstubs, it was based on information from Agliotti. This is true in\r\nrelation to all the relevant stubs.\n[68] Mr Dean Friedman from KPMG\r\nwas instructed, pursuant to his forensic investigation for JCI, to do\r\na forensic analysis of the\nappellant’s finances. Amongst other\r\nthings, he found a significant change of trend in the appellant’s\r\nbank account\nduring the period January 2005 until March 2005. During\r\nJanuary and February 2005 no cheque payments were made form the\r\nappellant’s\nbank account, unlike the months before and after\r\nthat time, when cheque payments were, on average, well in excess of\r\nR10 000 per\nmonth. For the period January until March 2005 no cash\r\nwithdrawals were made and credit card expenditure from January until\r\nApril\n2005 dropped, on average, by several thousand Rand. The\r\nappellant offered no explanation for this drop in the spending\r\npatterns\nfrom his bank account. It is hardly conceivable that the\r\nappellant, faced with the dilemma just illustrated, was unable to\r\ntender\nan explanation if one, other than the incriminating one\r\nproffered by the respondent, existed. I state this whilst not losing\r\nsight\nof the fact that the appellant testified that his wife ran the\r\nhousehold finances. Nothing was suggested that barred her from\r\ntestifying.\n[69] An attempt was made on\r\nbehalf of the appellant to illustrate that Agliotti and Muller were\r\ntalking about different incidents\nin relation to the December 2004\r\npayment, as Muller was confused about the date of the event to which\r\nshe testified. Her recollection\nwas not crystal clear, but she\r\nremembered that the incident occurred towards the end of a year that\r\nAgliotti went to Mauritius.\nWhilst giving evidence she recalled that\r\nthe incident occurred before the death of Kebble, who was murdered on\r\n27 September 2005.\nThere is no merit in the contention that Agliotti\r\nand Muller were not testifying about the exact same payment.\n[70] The trial court correctly\r\nconcluded that sufficient corroboration existed to substantiate the\r\nconclusion that the appellant,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, was the\r\nrecipient of R110 000 from Agliotti of which R100 000 was drawn\r\nwith cheque 0266 from the\nSpring Lights account. The further findings\r\nby the trial court followed the same pattern. Against the backdrop of\r\nnumerous payments\nhaving occurred, supported by a particular cash\r\ncheque, the stub of which contained some reference to the appellant\r\nand the general\ncorroboration referred to above and detailed with\r\ncare in the judgment by the trial court, the appellant was convicted\r\nof receiving\nthree further payments. The first two are evidenced by\r\ncheques; the first being cheque 0127, the stub of which reflected the\r\ninscription\n‘CASH JSGA’ made out on 14 June 2004 for an\r\namount of R10 000; the second being cheque 0355 dated 28 September\r\n2005\nmade out in the amount of R30 000, the cheque stub reflecting\r\n‘CASH Chief’. Agliotti interpreted the ‘JSGA’\n\nto refer to ‘Jackie Selebi Glen Agliotti’.\n[71] Insofar as the general\r\ncorroboration relied on by the trial court is concerned, I am of the\r\nview that the trial court, in applying\nthe rules of caution and\r\nseeking corroboration, was benevolent to the appellant and preferred\r\nto refrain from convicting the appellant\nin relation to a specific\r\npayment when the faintest doubt was raised. Thus the appellant was\r\nnot convicted in relation to four\nmore cheques that reflected\r\ninscriptions that could be interpreted as references to the\r\nappellant.\n[72] In relation to cheque 0355\r\nparticularly strong corroboration was found which also serves to\r\nstrengthen the general corroboration.\nAgliotti testified that the day\r\nafter Brett Kebble was murdered, 28 September 2005, whilst on his way\r\nto the mortuary to identify\nKebble’s remains, he received a\r\ntelephone call from the appellant, who asked him for money. He\r\nspecifically remembered the\ntelephone call because of the unusual\r\ncircumstances he found himself in when he received the call. During\r\ncross-examination it\nwas denied that the appellant made this call.\r\nObjective evidence of telephone records was thereafter found and\r\nintroduced that\nindicated that the appellant did indeed make a phone\r\ncall to Agliotti on that day. The cheque is dated the same day. Its\r\nstub contains\nthe words ‘CASH Chief’. Agliotti testified\r\nthat he used to refer to the appellant, and nobody else, as ‘Chief’.\n[73] The only version, other than\r\na denial by the appellant, that was argued in answer, was that the\r\nR30 000, represented by this\ncheque, was used by Agliotti to make a\r\ncustoms payment for the release of a container that later turned out\r\nto have contained narcotics.\nThe argument is not supported by the\r\nfacts and is rather opportunistic. It confuses Agliotti’s\r\nevidence of the payment for\nthe container and ignores the inscription\r\non the cheque stub and the objective evidence of the telephone\r\nconversation. In fact,\nit constitutes a random connection of two\r\namounts of R30 000 that could not be connected on the evidence.\n[74] Shortly after this payment,\r\non 16 October 2005, the appellant took the unusual step of personally\r\ncalling at a clothing store,\nGray’s, in Sandton City, where he\r\nand Agliotti regularly shopped together, and made a cash payment of\r\nR25 000 on this account\nwhich at that stage stood at R56 430. An\r\namount of R25 000 was not withdrawn from his account for this\r\npurpose. The appellant having\nbeen in possession of such a large,\r\notherwise unaccounted sum of cash, provides a measure of\r\ncorroboration for the respondent’s\nversion that Agliotti had\r\npaid him R30 000 in cash.\n[75] The third additional payment\r\nthe court a quo found had been made was an amount of $30 000 Agliotti\r\nsaid he had made to the\nappellant on 23 May 2005 at the O R Tambo\r\nairport shortly before the appellant departed on a trip to Cyprus.\r\nThe reason for this\npayment further paints the picture of the nature\r\nof the relationship between the appellant and Agliotti and adds to\r\nthe general\ncorroboration.\n[76] Rautenbach desired to return\r\nto South Africa, but due to the warrant that had been issued for his\r\narrest he did not feel free\nto do so. He serendipitously met with\r\nAgliotti in Zimbabwe and learnt about the relationship between\r\nAgliotti and the appellant.\nHe requested Agliotti to attempt to\r\npersuade the appellant to pay attention to his case with the ultimate\r\nview of facilitating\nhis return to South Africa without running the\r\nrisk of being arrested. Agliotti was keen to assist and charge a fee\r\nfor his efforts.\nOn Agliotti’s insistence the appellant met\r\nTidmarsh, Rautenbach’s attorney, in his hotel room in Sandton\r\non 19 April\n2005. They discussed Rautenbach’s dilemma. The\r\nappellant testified that by doing so he gave Tidmarsh the opportunity\r\nthey\nsought, namely to have Rautenbach’s case listened to by\r\n‘higher authority’. During this meeting the appellant,\non\r\nhis own version, gave Tidmarsh information that assisted him to\r\nrespond to a letter to Rautenbach from Ngcuka. This information\n\nincluded that Ngcuka was suspected of ‘abusing his office’\r\nand was being used by British Intelligence for their purposes.\n[77] Not long after this meeting,\r\non 22 April 2005, Agliotti flew to Lumbumbashi in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Congo, met Rautenbach\nat the airport who handed him $100\r\n000 for arranging the meeting with the appellant. Rautenbach’s\r\nevidence in this regard\nwas not challenged. He was accepted by the\r\ntrial court as a reliable witness and that finding is also not\r\nchallenged in this court.\nDuring this time, somewhere during May or\r\nJune 2005, the appellant had occasion to share a flight with Pikoli\r\nto the Eastern Cape\non official duties. According to Pikoli, when\r\nthey disembarked, the appellant asked him why his department does not\r\ndrop the charges\nagainst Rautenbach. He responded by asking why they\r\nwould do that and the appellant replied that he was in possession of\r\na letter\nthat could embarrass Ngcuka, a previous National Director of\r\nPublic Prosecutions (NDPP), and Pikoli’s office. According to\n\nPikoli he dismissed this communication as he believed it was not a\r\nmatter the appellant should have been involved in. Pikoli’s\n\nevidence was accepted by the trial court and that finding is not\r\nattacked in this court.\n[78] I need to interrupt myself\r\nat this stage to state that both the appellant and Agliotti\r\ntestified, on the strength of a letter\nwritten by Ngcuka, who was\r\nthen the NDPP, to Rautenbach, that Ngcuka had tried to bribe\r\nRautenbach. Rautenbach was not of that\nview. The letter does not\r\nillustrate that intention either and when the appellant was driven to\r\nconcede that fact during cross-examination,\nhe said that Agliotti\r\ninformed him that Rautenbach disclosed to him that Ngcuka had tried\r\nto bribe him.\n[79] Agliotti testified that on\r\n23 May 2005, shortly after he had received $100 000 from Rautenbach,\r\nhe met the appellant at the\nO R Tambo airport and handed him an\r\namount of US Dollars. The appellant denied this. On that day the\r\nappellant left the country\nto attend an Interpol meeting in Cyprus.\r\nHe was advanced €700 by the South African Police Service (SAPS)\r\nfor the trip. Upon\nhis return, he exchanged $2 500 into Rand at the\r\nairport. He tried to explain the inconsistency by stating that his\r\ntrip was funded\nby Interpol, therefore he had additional foreign\r\ncurrency. This was conclusively illustrated during his evidence not\r\nto have been\nthe case. His counsel ventured another explanation. That\r\nfrom his many travels abroad the appellant accumulated some foreign\r\ncurrency.\nEven though there is some support in the appellant’s\r\nevidence that he held some foreign currency in his safe at home, the\n\ninsurmountable difficulty with this submission is that it was not the\r\nexplanation offered by the appellant.\n[80] In addition to payments, the\r\ntrial court also found that Agliotti bought several items of Fubu\r\nclothing for the appellant’s\ntwo sons. This finding was based\r\non the evidence of Muller that corroborated Agliotti’s version.\r\nShe testified of an occasion\nin Sandton City shopping centre when the\r\nappellant, his wife and sons, met with Agliotti and Muller at the\r\nclothing store that\nsells the Fubu brand of clothing and Agliotti\r\ntook the appellant’s sons and treated them to several choices\r\nof items of clothing.\nIt is hardly imaginable that Muller would have\r\ndreamt up this incident in the detail that she recounted it. As\r\nMuller was correctly\nfound to have been a reliable witness, her\r\nevidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction in this regard.\n[81] The trial court made no\r\nerror in reaching the conclusion that it did about benefits in the\r\nform of payments to the appellant\nand clothing for his sons. If\r\nanything, the trial court was benevolent towards the appellant in its\r\napproach of the evidence.\n[82] The trial court found that\r\nthe respondent proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that quid pro quo\r\nof four kinds were given by\nthe appellant for gratification received\r\nfrom Agliotti. Three were in the nature of information shared and the\r\nfourth in the nature\nof his attendance at various dinners and\r\nmeetings at Agility’s insistence.\n[83] Agliotti gave evidence that\r\nduring approximately July or August 2006 the appellant telephoned him\r\nand asked to see him urgently.\nWhen they met he showed Agliotti a\r\ndocument consisting of two pages, it displayed the United Kingdom\r\n(UK) coat of arms, it referred\nto ‘Her Majesty’s Customs’\r\nand it correctly recorded some of Agliotti’s travels to the UK\r\nand with whom\nhe met whilst there. The real value of disclosing this\r\ndocument to Agliotti is that it conveyed that the UK were monitoring\r\nhis\nmovements as they suspected him of drug trafficking. Agliotti\r\nreferred to this document in his prison notes as ‘Report . .\n.\r\n. H.M.S. customs’.\n[84] Standing alone, this\r\nevidence by Agliotti is not indicative of much and as the trial court\r\nfound him to be an unreliable witness,\nwould have been meaningless if\r\nnot corroborated. The nature of corroboration that was proved by the\r\nrespondent, however, was devastating\nfor the appellant’s case.\r\nWhat is certain is, if such a document existed, it was definitely\r\nshown to Agliotti, because there\nwas no other way that he could have\r\nhad the specific knowledge of its content that he had testified\r\nabout.\n[85] Such a document was\r\nintroduced into evidence. It was referred to during the trial as the\r\n‘UK Report’. It is a letter,\naddressed to Mark Hankel\r\n(Hankel), Director of Crime Intelligence of the SAPS from the British\r\nHigh Commission on a letterhead\nbearing the following inscription\r\nunder the UK coat of arms: ‘HM Customs and Excise’ and\r\nunderneath that: ‘Law\nEnforcement’. It was dated 3 August\r\n2004. Hankel testified on behalf of the respondent. He received this\r\ndocument from the\nUK Customs authorities. At the time, his department\r\nwas conducting an investigation into drug related activities of\r\nseveral people,\nAgliotti having been one of them. They called this\r\ninvestigation ‘Operation Chaser’. This letter was kept in\r\nthe file\npertaining to Operation Chaser. When he was approached by\r\nthe prosecuting authority about the existence of such a letter, he\r\ndiscovered\nthat the file had been booked out by a Captain Thema\r\n(Thema) of the SAPS on 21 April 2006 and was never returned.\n[86] During his evidence the\r\nappellant conceded that subsequent to Hankel’s evidence, he\r\nconsulted with Thema, whilst knowing\nthat the latter was a state\r\nwitness and he was not entitled to consult with him. Despite the\r\nevidence and the appellant’s\nconsultation with Thema, he was\r\nnever called as a witness in the appellant’s case. There was no\r\nanswer to this evidence,\nand the appellant had none. The trial court\r\nmade no mistake in its finding against the appellant in this regard.\n[87] In his prison notes Agliotti\r\nreferred to a ‘NIA’ report that was shown to him by the\r\nappellant. He testified that\nthe appellant had a thick document which\r\nhe opened and showed two pages of to Agliotti. Two lines of the\r\nwriting in it were underlined\nand that related to an allegation by\r\none Jurgen Kögl (Kögl) that the Kebbles were paying the\r\nappellant. The appellant\nasked Agliotti to find out about Kögl\r\nand told him that the relevant document was an intelligence report\r\ndestined for the\nPresident of South Africa.\n[88] Such a document was\r\nintroduced into evidence. It is called a National Intelligence\r\nEstimate (NIE report), an annual document\nprepared by the National\r\nIntelligence Coordinating Committee (NICOC) for the purpose of\r\nproviding the South African Government\nwith an assessment of the key\r\nissues of security concerns to the country on a national and\r\ninternational level. The NIE report\nindeed contains the information\r\nthat Agliotti testified about. The appellant’s response to this\r\nevidence was most unusual.\nHe denied that he showed the particular\r\nNIE report to Agliotti but conceded that he showed him some document\r\nconcerning ‘information\npedlars’ which might have\r\ncontained a reference to Kögl. During the course of his evidence\r\nthe appellant produced a\ndocument which he said was similar to the\r\none that he showed to Agliotti. The document was never put to\r\nAgliotti during the latter’s\nevidence. On the face of it, it\r\nwas a classified document, which would lead to the same conclusion\r\nthan the one drawn by the trial\ncourt in relation to the NIE report.\r\nThe appellant then testified that he had the actual document that he\r\nhad shown to Agliotti\nat home. That document, he said, he\r\ndeclassified to enable him to legitimately show it to Agliotti. When\r\nhe brought the document\nto court, it was apparent that it had not\r\nbeen declassified, and during further cross-examination it was\r\nconvincingly illustrated\nthat the document had been fabricated after\r\nAgliotti had given his evidence.\n[89] The trial court dealt\r\nextensively in its judgment with this evidence as the fourth of the\r\nappellant’s ‘big lies’\nand correctly concluded that\r\nthe appellant did show the ‘NIE report’ to Agliotti.\n[90] The last of the documents\r\nthat the trial court found the appellant showed to Agliotti, is an\r\neight page document consisting\nof a statement attached to an e-mail.\r\nAccording to Agliotti the appellant telephoned him and arranged to\r\nmeet him urgently in the\nparking area of Makro in Woodmead. There he\r\nhanded the document to Agliottti with the communication that the\r\ndocument could be\nused to discredit the DSO. The details of the\r\ndocument and why it may have provided ground to discredit the DSO is\r\nirrelevant for\ncurrent purposes. Agliotti handed the document to his\r\nattorney. The document included information about an investigation in\r\nwhich\nAgliotti was implicated.\n[91] The composition of this\r\ndocument was not challenged on behalf of the appellant during\r\nAgliotti’s evidence. During his\nown evidence, however, he\r\nvacillated between whether he had ever seen the entire eight\r\npage-document or only part of it, which\npart he had seen and handed\r\nover to Agliotti and the reason why he gave it to Agliotti. The trial\r\ncourt correctly found that the\nrespondent had proven that the\r\nappellant handed the full document to Agliotti and that the appellant\r\nwas dishonest in relation\nthereto. This was dealt with by the trial\r\ncourt as the sixth of the appellant’s ‘big lies’.\n[92] Not much\r\nneed to be said about the trial court’s findings about the\r\nmeetings and dinners that the appellant attended\nwith Agliotti, other\r\nthan that the finding is not to be faulted. I do make reference to\r\nsome of the meetings and dinners in a discussion\nthat follows on the\r\nnature of the relationship between the appellant and Agliotti. Before\r\nI proceed to that discussion it is important\nto state that the\r\nmendacity of the appellant went directly to the essence of vital\r\naspects of the case against him and greatly\nreduced the risk of\r\naccepting the evidence against him.\n14\nThe palpable\r\ndishonesty apparent from the appellant’s testimony leaves one\r\naghast. It reveals, without any doubt, a guilty\nstate of mind.\n[93] The trial court made the\r\nfollowing finding in relation to the requirements of s 4 of the\r\nPrevention and Combating of Corrupt\nActivities Act 12 of 2004 (PCCA\r\nAct):\n‘\nWhilst\r\nthe act criminalises the conduct of both the corruptor and the\r\ncorruptee, it clearly and expressly, does not require the\nexistence\r\nof an agreement between them.’\nTowards the end of the judgment\r\nthe trial court concluded as follows on the evidence:\n‘\nAs\r\nindicated above there is no evidence of an agreement between the\r\naccused and Agliotti for benefits to be given to Agliotti in\nreturn\r\nfor payments. On the evidence it is clear that such an agreement or\r\nunderstanding must have existed. It did not have to\nbe expressly\r\nconcluded. At the very least it came into existence over a period of\r\ntime. The accused must have known the adage that\nthere is no such\r\nthing as a free dinner.’\n[94] These findings were attacked\r\nby the appellant in this Court. In the heads of argument delivered on\r\nbehalf of the appellant\nthe following submission is made:\n‘\nWe\r\nsubmit that there can be no doubt that PCCA requires as a very basic\r\nrequirement that any gratification accepted or agreed to\nbe accepted\r\nby an accused person must specifically relate to some understanding\r\nbetween the person giving the gratification and\nthe person receiving\r\nthe gratification that he will act or omit to act in a specific\r\nagreed manner and/or influence another person\nto so act.’\n[95] It is further submitted on\r\nbehalf of the appellant that although the trial court was correct in\r\nfinding that there was no evidence\nof an agreement between the\r\nappellant and Agliotti, the trial court erred in inferring that ‘it\r\nwas clear that such an agreement\nor understanding must have existed’.\r\nIt was further contended that the finding ‘is of course\r\ndirectly contrary to the\nallegations in the charge sheet . . . and\r\nalso contrary to the evidence given by the State witnesses’.\n[96] The factual findings and\r\nconviction by the trial court on the basis set out above, consist of\r\nan acceptance of a gratification\non the one hand and the giving of a\r\nquid pro quo by the appellant on the other hand, on the basis of an\r\ninferred agreement. As\nsuch the findings fulfils the requirements of\r\ns 4(1)\n(a)\n(i)\n(bb)\n:\n‘\nAny\r\npublic officer who . . . accepts . . . any gratification from any\r\nother person . . . in order to act, . . . in a manner that\namounts to\r\nthe . . . misuse or selling of information or material acquired in\r\nthe course of the, exercise, carrying out or performance\nof any\r\npowers, duties or functions arising out of a constitutional,\r\nstatutory, contractual or any other legal obligation; . . .\nis guilty\r\nof the offence of corrupt activities relating to public officers.’\n[97] Section 4, in my view, does\r\nnot require an agreement between the corruptor and the corruptee, nor\r\ndoes it require a quid pro\nquo from the corruptee. It must be plainly\r\nunderstood that the conviction in this case on the evidence that\r\nestablished an agreement\nand the giving of a quid pro quo, is not the\r\nlow water mark of the section.\n[98] On the view that I take of s\r\n4, the trial court would have been justified to convict the appellant\r\neven without a finding that\nhe had provided a quid pro quo.\nSection 4 (1)(\na\n)(ii)\r\nreads:\n‘\nAny\r\npublic officer who . . . accepts . . . any gratification from any\r\nother person . . . in order to act, . . . in a manner that\namounts to\r\n–\n(\naa\n)\r\nthe abuse of a position of authority;\n(\nbb\n)\r\na breach of trust; or\n(\ncc\n)\r\nthe violation of a legal duty or a set of rules;\nis guilty of the\r\noffence of corrupt activities relating to public officers.’\n[99] Section 25 of the PCCA Act\r\nsupports the wide interpretation of s 4. It provides:\n‘\nWhenever\r\nan accused person is charged with an offence under Part 1, 2, 3 or 4,\r\nor section 20 or 21 (in so far as it relates to the\naforementioned\r\noffences) of Chapter 2, it is not a valid defence for that accused\r\nperson to contend that he or she–\n(\na\n)\r\ndid not have the power, right or opportunity to perform or not to\r\nperform the act in relation to which the gratification was given,\n\naccepted or offered;\n(b\n)\r\naccepted or agreed or offered to accept, or gave or agreed or offered\r\nto give the gratification without intending to perform or\nnot to\r\nperform the act in relation to which the gratification was given,\r\naccepted or offered; or\n(c\n)\r\nfailed to perform or not to perform the act in relation to which the\r\ngratification was given, accepted or offered.’\n[100] In the charge sheet the\r\nrespondent relied on an allegation that the appellant and Agliotti\r\nhad conducted a ‘generally\ncorrupt relationship’. An\r\ninvestigation of the nature of their relationship serves to\r\nillustrate that the requirements of\ns 4 were satisfied on a\r\nnarrower basis as well.\n[101] I turn first to an\r\ninvestigation of the appellant’s behaviour in relation to\r\nAgliotti on either common cause or uncontested\nfacts. The appellant’s\r\noffice was situated in Pretoria and that of Agliotti in Midrand. The\r\nappellate went to Agliotti’s\noffice regularly, approximately\r\ntwice a month, during office hours and often in full uniform. They\r\nregularly met in shopping centres,\nduring office hours, to have\r\ncoffee and to shop together for exclusive clothing, for which they\r\nboth had a passion. They communicated\nregularly via telephone. The\r\nevidence showed that during the period 1 July 2004 until 20 August\r\n2004, a mere seven weeks, there\nwere 57 instances of telephonic\r\ncontact between them, 41 of which were initiated by Agliotti and 16\r\nthereof were made by the appellant.\nDespite their closeness the\r\nappellant and Agliotti never visited each other’s homes and\r\nincluded their families in their\ninteraction only on rare and\r\nisolated occasions.\n[102] The appellant met with\r\nTidmarsh. There was a stark contrast between the reasons for the\r\nmeeting put to state witnesses and\ntestified to by the appellant.\r\nDuring his evidence he insisted that the meeting took place on his\r\ninsistence and was about official\npolice business. He went to listen\r\nto a complaint from Tidmarsh about the manner in which the office of\r\nthe NDPP was treating Rautenbach\nand to verify Agliotti’s\r\nrevelation to him that Ngcuka attempted to bribe Rautenbach.\r\nCuriously though, they met at Tidmarsh’s\nhotel rather than at\r\nthe appellant’s office and he took Agliotti with him. The\r\nevidence ultimately revealed that neither\nRautenbach nor Tidmarsh was\r\nof the view that Ngcuka tried to extract a bribe from Rautenbach.\n[103] The appellant allowed and\r\naccommodated behaviour from Agliotti that strikes as peculiar from\r\nthe National Commissioner of\nPolice. Agliotti telephoned him when he\r\nwas stopped at the door of an aircraft at O R Tambo Airport and\r\nquestioned by members of\nthe SAPS. Again, when Agliotti was searched\r\nat Heathrow Airport he telephoned the appellant with the news.\r\nAgliotti also telephoned\nthe appellant from the scene of a\r\nhousebreaking and after speaking to the appellant handed the\r\ntelephone to the police officer\non the scene who was busy performing\r\nhis duties. The appellant then instructed him to do his job well as\r\nthe appellant was his\nfriend.\n[104] The appellant met with the\r\nKebbles despite the fact that he knew, since August 2003, that\r\nAgliotti received an amount of more\nthan R12 million from the Kebbles\r\nfor having the appellant ‘on board’. During this dinner\r\nthe appellant discussed with\nBrett Kebble the details of his father’s\r\narrest at the O R Tambo Airport by members of the SAPS and did so in\r\nthe presence\nof Agliotti. The appellant blatantly lied about the\r\nmotivation for and content of the dinner conversation with the\r\nKebbles in that\nhe tendered several versions in this regard. One of\r\nthose versions was that the dinners with the Kebbles only contained\r\nconvivial\nconversation.\n[105] The appellant also met with\r\nNassif on Agliotti’s request, an arrangement for the purpose of\r\nconsidering using Nassif’s\nsecurity company to address certain\r\ncriminal acts. Similarly he met with one Jumean to listen to a\r\ncomplaint about a police reservist,\nBrad Wood. Several other such\r\nmeetings were arranged by Agliotti and attended by the appellant. At\r\nbest for the appellant, it shows\na willingness to be involved in\r\nissues that had nothing to do with essential SAPS business, but only\r\nwith minor issues related\nthereto, not deserving of the concern or\r\nattention of the National Commissioner of Police.\n[106] These facts paint a picture\r\nneither purely of friendship nor of a professional relationship, but\r\nof an undesirable confusion\nof the two. What stands out is that the\r\nappellant indulged Agliotti in many ways. These indulgences should be\r\nseen against the\nbackdrop of the appellant’s own knowledge\r\nabout Agliotti.\n[107] He was fully aware that\r\nAgliotti flaunted his association with the appellant. The appellant\r\ntestified that Agliotti had a\nlot of information about crime (he\r\ndescribed him as an ‘encyclopaedia’ of criminal events)\r\nthat he shared with him.\nIt is an inevitable inference that one has\r\nto be close to crime to have information about it, but nevertheless,\r\nthe appellant continued\nhis association with Agliotti. During 2003\r\nthe South African Revenue Service (SARS) informed the appellant that\r\nit was investigating\nAgliotti in relation to contraban, but the\r\nappellant continued to closely associate with Agliotti. The appellant\r\ntried to justify\nhis continued involvement with Agliotti by denying\r\nthat he ever had any concrete evidence about Agliotti’s\r\ninvolvement in\ncrime. However, he chose to never question or\r\ninvestigate the rumours about Agliotti or why he was such a rich\r\nsource of information\nabout crime.\n[108] The appellant could contact\r\nAgliotti without any difficulty when one of the senior forensic\r\ninvestigators of the Special Investigation\nUnit of SAPS, Roeland, was\r\nunable to do so. After Brett Kebble was murdered, Roeland’s\r\ninvestigations revealed that several\nmobile telephones registered to\r\nAgliotti had been active, the day prior to the murder, on the scene\r\nof the murder. When she and\nher staff tried to make contact with\r\nAgliotti on these numbers after the murder, they were unsuccessful\r\nbecause the numbers were\ninactive. However, when they briefed the\r\nappellant about this in an official meeting, the appellant dialled a\r\nnumber in their presence\nand spoke to Agliotti. When he was\r\nrequested, after the conversation, to divulge the number that he had\r\ndialled, he ignored the\nrequest. Initially, during the trial, he\r\ndenied that this incident had happened although he subsequently\r\nconceded that it had.\nHe then tried to brush the incident off by\r\nsaying that the members of the SAPS had all the relevant means to\r\ntrace and make contact\nwith Agliotti. This evidence ties in with that\r\nof Agliotti when he indicated that after the start of the so-called\r\nmedia campaign\nagainst him and the appellant, during 2006, he\r\n(Agliotti) changed his telephone to a so-called ‘pay-as-you-go’\r\nto escape\ndetection and media attention.\n[109] I now turn to set out the\r\nappellant’s knowledge in relation to Agliotti. Since August\r\n2003 he had clear evidence that\nAgliotti abused their relationship\r\nand received a vast amount of money from the Kebbles to retain his\r\ncloseness to the appellant.\nAlso during 2003 he learned of Operation\r\nChaser, a criminal investigation into international drug related\r\ncrime by the Special\nOperations Intelligence Centre of the SAPS in\r\nwhich Agliotti, albeit not the main suspect, also featured. The\r\nappellant, during\nthe course of 2003, asked Agliotti whether he was\r\ninvolved in crime. He explained that he ‘[w]anted to make sure\r\nhe is not\ninvolved in any crime if he is associated with me’.\r\nThe appellant clearly harboured justified suspicions that Agliotti\r\nwas\ninvolved in criminal activity, a perfectly reasonable suspicion\r\nconsidering his knowledge about Agliotti, and also asked senior\n\npolice officials about him. According to the appellant he never\r\nreceived an answer to his request, but he also never followed up\nhis\r\nrequest. The appellant called Agliotti a ‘hustler’ and\r\nsaid that if a hustler like Agliotti offered him money,\nhe would\r\nthink there is something behind it, that he is trying to buy his (the\r\nappellant’s) favour.\n[110] The above summary shows\r\nthat the nature of the relationship between the appellant and\r\nAgliotti, based on common cause facts,\nwas no ordinary relationship.\r\nOne does not expect the National Commissioner of Police to take his\r\nfriend along on police business;\nto take his friend and informer\r\nalong to the very meeting where the verification of the informer’s\r\ninformation is to take\nplace; to meet his friend to shop together\r\nduring office hours; to favour his friend by attending to minor\r\ncomplaints for which\nstructures exist to be dealt with; and to\r\ndivulge information regarding police operations to his friend’s\r\nfriends. If the\nrelationship was so close to have made these\r\noccurrences ordinary, one would have expected it to spill over to the\r\nfamilies of\nthe appellant and Agliotti, which did not happen.\n[111] How did the appellant\r\nexplain this unusual relationship? It was repeatedly put to state\r\nwitnesses on his behalf that he had\nan innocent friendship with\r\nAgliotti. I have already illustrated that to have been highly\r\nimprobable, to the point of being unbelievable.\nDuring his own\r\nevidence, however, the appellant dramatically changed this version\r\nand described the relationship as one between\ninformer and handler.\r\nThis explanation is equally inherently improbable. Their relationship\r\nwas a public one. Agliotti was previously,\nfrom the beginning of 2002\r\nfor a period of one year, registered as a police informer and had an\r\nofficial handler, not the appellant.\nHe lost that status within a\r\nyear and was deregistered as an informer. The appellant’s\r\nmendacity in this regard, dealt with\nextensively by the trial court,\r\nis yet another indication that the relationship between them was\r\nextraordinary, not one of friendship,\nnor one between informer and\r\nhandler.\n[112] The only\r\nreasonable inference to be drawn from the nature of their\r\nrelationship is that the appellant felt beholden to Agliotii.\n\nAgliotti’s generosity did not stop at the appellant’s\r\ndoor, he used the R12 million that he received from the Kebbles\nfor\r\nthe purpose that it was given. The focus in\nS\r\nv Shaik & others\n[2006] ZASCA 105\n;\n2007\r\n(1) SA 240\n(SCA) was on the other side of the coin to the present,\r\nbut, bearing the obvious factual differences in mind, the following\r\npassage\nfrom the trial court’s judgment highlights the obvious\r\ninferences to be drawn:\n15\n‘\nIf\r\nZuma could not repay money, how else could he do so than by providing\r\nthe help of his name and political office as and when it\nwas asked,\r\nparticularly in the field of government contracted work, which is\r\nwhat Shaik was hoping to benefit from. And Shaik must\nhave foreseen\r\nand, by inference, did foresee that if he made these payments, Zuma\r\nwould respond in that way. . . .\nhe also realised the\r\npossible advantages to his business interests of providing the means\r\nto retain Zuma’s goodwill by helping\nhim to support a lifestyle\r\nbeyond what he could afford on his Minister’s remuneration.’\nIn my view, the appellant must\r\nhave realised that Agliotti’s generosity and the payments he\r\nreceived from him created a dynamic,\nwhereby he, in his post as head\r\nof the nation’s police service, would be indebted to him and\r\nwould have to remain willing\nto do him favours.\n[113] This\r\nleads to the conclusion that the appellant, on his own version,\r\nabused his position of authority and breached the trust\nplaced in the\r\nposition that he held in contravention of s 4(1)\n(a)\n(ii).\r\nStrictly speaking, this finding obviates the need to investigate\r\nwhether the appellant gave any quid pro quo for the payments\nthat he\r\nreceived. But, as I have already pointed out, he did.\n[114] For these reasons I agree\r\nthat the appeal should be dismissed.\n__________________\nS SNYDERS\nJudge of Appeal\nAPPEARANCES\nFor Appellant: JG Cilliers SC\r\n(with him SJ Coetzee & J Motepe)\nInstructed by:\nGeyser & Coetzee Attorneys,\r\nc/o Aucamp & Cronje Attorneys, Johannesburg\nHill, McHardy & Herbst Inc,\r\nBloemfontein\nFor Respondent: GC Nel (with him\r\nA Johnson)\nInstructed by:\nThe National Director for Public\r\nProsecutions, Johannesburg\nThe National Director for Public\r\nProsecutions, Bloemfontein\n1\nC\r\n\tR Snyman\nCriminal Law\n5ed\r\n\t(2008) at 412.\n2\nSnyman\r\n\tat 418\n.\n3\nSee\r\n\tsection 1 of the PCCA Act.\n4\nSnyman\r\n\tat 419.\n5\nSnyman\r\n\tat 419.\n6\nSnyman\r\n\tat 419.\n7\nIt\r\n\tmust be remembered that Agliotti was a witness in terms of\ns 204\nof\r\n\tthe\nCriminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977\nwho had been warned as such by\r\n\tthe trial court before giving evidence.\nSection 204\nrequires a\r\n\twitness to answer all questions put to him or her truthfully and\r\n\thonestly and, if necessary incriminates himself.\nIf the court is\r\n\tsatisfied that a witness has complied with this standard the court\r\n\twill grant him or her immunity from prosecution.\n8\nDianne\r\n\tMuller was a member of a close corporation known as Monster\r\n\tMarketing CC trading as Maverick.

    "facts": "Jacob Sello Selebi, former National Commissioner of Police and former Interpol President, was accused of receiving substantial sums of money, foreign currency and gifts from Glen Norbert Agliotti in exchange for favours. Evidence showed a series of cash payments and cheques (notably R110 000, R30 000, R10 000 and US dollar amounts) allegedly handed to Selebi, as well as clothing for his sons. The prosecution alleged that Selebi, in return, supplied Agliotti with confidential information, facilitated investigations, arranged meetings with senior officials and attended dinners, thereby providing a clear quid pro quo. The trial court accepted the testimony of Agliotti and Dianne Muller, finding the payments corroborated, and concluded that Selebi's conduct satisfied the elements of corruption under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (PCCA) 12 of 2004.",
    "issues": "The appeal centred on two questions: (1) whether the State proved beyond reasonable doubt that Selebi received the payments and benefits from Agliotti; and (2) whether the State proved that Selebi provided any quid pro quo for those gratifications in the manner required by section 4(1)(a) of the PCCA Act.",
    "principles": "Section 4(1)(a) of the PCCA Act criminalises a public officer who accepts or agrees to accept any gratification in order to act in a manner that amounts to abuse of authority, breach of trust or violation of legal duty. The elements include acceptance of gratification, the corrupt intention to act, unlawfulness of the act, and a link between the gratification and the improper act. The court noted that intention, while not expressly stated, is read into the provision and is presumed unless rebutted. Section 24 creates a rebuttable presumption of intention where the State proves the gratification and cannot link it to a lawful purpose.",
    "application": "The appellate court accepted the trial judge's assessment of the evidence. The payments were corroborated by Agliotti’s testimony, Muller’s corroborative evidence and forensic analysis by KPMG, showing unusual cash flow and unexplained expenditures. The court found that the series of documents shown to Agliotti (UK report, NIE report, e‑mail) and the meetings/dinners arranged at Agliotti’s request demonstrated the required quid pro quo. The inference of corrupt intention was deemed irresistible given the payments, the nature of the benefits, and Selebi’s own admissions that he recognised the illicit purpose of the money. Consequently, the State satisfied both statutory elements.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, upholding Selebi’s conviction for corruption under section 4(1)(a) of the PCCA Act. The conviction and the factual findings regarding receipt of payments, gifts and the provision of quid pro quo were affirmed."
