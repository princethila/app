appeal from:\nSouth Gauteng High Court (Johannesburg) (Cassim AJ sitting as court\r\nof first instance):\n1 The appeal is upheld\r\nwith costs, including the costs of two counsel.\n2 The order of the high\r\ncourt is set aside and replaced with the following:\n‘\nA\r\nSubject to the Applicants approaching a Refugee Reception Office as\r\ncontemplated in paragraph D below, the First and Second Respondents\n\nare interdicted from deporting the Applicants unless and until their\r\nstatus under the\nRefugees Act, 130 of 1998\n, has been lawfully and\r\nfinally determined.\nB It is declared that the\r\ndetention of the Applicants is unlawful.\nC The Respondents are\r\ndirected to release the Applicants forthwith.\nD It is declared that, in\r\nterms of Regulation 2(2) of the Refugee

The First and Second\r\nRespondents are jointly and severally directed to pay the costs of\r\nthe Applicants.’\n______________________________________________________________\nJUDGMENT\n______________________________________________________________\nNAVSA JA (CLOETE, MAYA,\r\nBOSIELO and LEACH JJA concurring)\n[1] On 9 November 2011 this appeal was heard and upheld\r\nand the order set out above was made. When handing down the judgment\r\nit\nwas indicated that the reasons would follow. The background to the\r\nappeal and the reasons for making the order are set out hereafter.\n[2] This appeal is about the principle of legality. It\r\ninvolves the interpretation and application of provisions of the\r\nRefugees\nAct 130 of 1998 (the RA) and of regulations issued\r\nthereunder. The appeal is directed against a judgment of the South\r\nGauteng High\nCourt, Johannesburg (Cassim AJ), in terms of which it\r\ndismissed an application by 19 Ethiopian nationals, the appellants,\r\nfor an\norder: (a) reviewing and setting aside an order of the\r\nMagistrates’ Court to extend warrants of detention and (b)\r\ninterdicting\nthe Minister of Home Affairs and the Director-General of\r\nthe Department of Home Affairs (the DG) from deporting them until\r\ntheir\nstatus under the RA, was lawfully and finally determined. The\r\nappellants had also sought an order that they be afforded an\r\nopportunity\nto approach a refugee reception centre and that the\r\nMinister and the DG be directed to accept their applications for\r\nasylum and\nto issue them with a temporary asylum seeker permit, in\r\naccordance with s 22 of the RA. They were granted none of the relief\r\nsought.\nBecause there was no prospect of recovery of costs no order\r\nwas made in that regard. The appeal was before us with the leave of\n\nthe court below.\n[3] There are aspects of\r\nthe manner in which proceedings were conducted in the court below\r\nthat must be addressed in the interest\nof the proper administration\r\nof justice. That exercise will involve, inter alia, scrutinising\r\nnumerous statements made by the court\nbelow during those proceedings.\r\nBut first it is necessary to set out in broad outline the case made\r\nby the appellants and the Minister\nand the DG’s response to it.\n[4]\r\nIf the 19 appellants are to be believed, they fled Ethiopia in about\r\nMay 2010 to escape political persecution and in fear of\ntheir lives,\r\nand walked for a year through Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique before\r\narriving in South Africa. According to the appellants,\nthey crossed\r\nthe South African/Mozambique border without being stopped by any\r\nimmigration officials. In the founding affidavit\nby the first\r\nappellant, he states that he and the other appellants were all\r\nsupporters of the opposition political party in Ethiopia,\nthe Oromo\r\nLiberation Front and as such they were pursued, threatened and in\r\nsome cases severely injured by the police and members\nof the ruling\r\nEthiopian Peoples’ Democratic Front. The first appellant stated\r\nthat because of the confidential nature of\nclaims for asylum he was\r\nnot providing any details of the appellants’ claims.\n1\nIn their affidavits each\r\nof the remaining appellants confirmed the allegations made by the\r\nfirst appellant.\n[5]\r\nAccording to the appellants, at the end of their travels they arrived\r\nin Johannesburg on 16 June 2011, encountering a Somali\nnational\r\nwith whom they could communicate in Amharic.\n2\nThey were hungry and were\r\noffered food by the Somalian who took them to a house in Mayfair and\r\ngave them a meal. Whilst there, a\nfight broke out between two\r\nSomalians causing the police to arrive. The police asked the\r\nappellants, through an interpreter, for\ndocumentation to prove that\r\nthey were lawfully resident in South Africa. When this could not be\r\nproduced they were arrested as\n‘illegal foreigners’.\n[6] After being detained\r\nat the Johannesburg police station from 16 June 2011 until\r\n24 June 2011 the appellants were transferred\nto Lindela, a holding\r\nfacility and repatriation centre controlled by the Department of Home\r\nAffairs. On 27 July 2011, approximately\na month after their arrival\r\nat Lindela and following on a meeting with their attorneys, Lawyers\r\nfor Human Rights, a letter on their\nbehalf was sent to the Department\r\nof Home Affairs in which they demanded that all deportation\r\nproceedings against them be halted\nand that they be released\r\nimmediately and afforded the opportunity to apply for asylum. There\r\nwas no written response to the letter.\nThat the letter was sent and\r\nnot responded to is undisputed. The contents of the letter bear\r\nrepeating:\n‘\n1.\r\nWe write on behalf of, and with instructions from 19 Ethiopian asylum\r\nseekers detained at Lindela since 24 June 2011. A list\nof the names\r\nof our clients is annexed hereto as “A” (our clients).\r\n(Please note that our clients’ names are\nspelt incorrectly on\r\ntheir Lindela cards).\n2. Our clients instruct\r\nus that they arrived in South Africa in June 2011, having fled\r\nEthiopia in fear for their lives and due\nto political persecution.\n3.\r\nWe do not set out herein the details of our clients’ asylum\r\nclaims, due to the confidential nature thereof and in accordance\nwith\r\nsection 21 (5) of the Refugees Act 130 of 1998 (“\nthe\nRefugees Act\n”\n>), which preserves the\r\nconfidential nature of our client’s claim.\n4. Our clients instruct\r\nus that following arrival in South Africa, and after meeting a Somali\r\nnational, they made their way to a\nhouse in Mayfair, which was\r\noccupied by Somali nationals who undertook to assist them.\n5. Our clients instruct\r\nus further that they were arrested by the police at this house on 16\r\nJune 2011, prior to having an opportunity\nto apply for asylum.\n6. Our clients instruct\r\nus that they were detained at the Johannesburg Central Police station\r\nfrom 16 June 2011 until 24 June 2011\nwhen they were transferred to\r\nLindela.\n7.\r\nAs asylum seekers, our clients cannot be deported and their detention\r\nfor purposes of deportation is thus unlawful. Deporting\nour clients\r\nwould be a violation of the principle of\nnon-refoulement\nas well as a contravention of the\nRefugees\nAct 130 of 1998\nand South Africa’s obligations under\r\ninternational law.\n8. We are therefore\r\ninstructed to demand, as we hereby do, that:\n1. All deportation\r\nproceedings against our clients be immediately halted;\n2. Our clients be\r\nimmediately released and afforded the opportunity of applying for\r\nasylum.\n9. Should our clients not\r\nbe released as outlined above by no later than Friday 29 July 2011,\r\nthey will take further steps as they\nmay be advised including\r\napproaching an appropriate Court for urgent relief.\n10. We trust this will\r\nnot be necessary and await your response.\n11. All of our clients’\r\nrights are reserved.’\n[7] Fearing imminent\r\ndeportation the appellants, as stated above, approached the South\r\nGauteng High Court for orders in the terms\nset out in para 2. In\r\ntheir founding affidavit in the court below the appellants disclosed\r\nthat they had recently become aware\nthat, on 27 June 2011, an\r\nunauthorised application had been made to that court on their behalf,\r\nfor an order that they be released\nfrom detention and that the\r\nMinister and the DG allow them to apply for asylum seeker permits.\r\nThe appellants denied that they\nhad signed the affidavits on which\r\nthe prior application had been based. According to the appellants,\r\nthey had not heard nor met\neither the advocate or the attorney who\r\nhad purportedly represented them during the hearing of that\r\napplication. On 30 June 2011\nthat application was dismissed\r\nby Hattingh AJ.\n[8] In the court below,\r\nin addition to the orders described in para 2, the appellants had\r\nalso sought, to the extent necessary,\na rescission of the order made\r\nby Hattingh AJ.\n[9] In opposing the\r\napplication in the court below, the Minister and the DG adopted the\r\nattitude that no justifiable basis had been\nprovided for the setting\r\naside of the order made by Hattingh AJ and contended that the\r\nappellants were now attempting ‘a\nsecond bite of the cherry’.\r\nThe Minister and the DG took the view that the court below, by virtue\r\nof Hattingh AJ’s\nconsideration of the merits of the prior\r\napplication, was\nfunctus officio\n. The Minister and the DG\r\nsubmitted that since the application was based on the same but\r\namplified grounds the proper course for\nthe appellants to have\r\nfollowed was to lodge an appeal against the judgment of Hattingh AJ.\n[10] Furthermore, the\r\nMinister and the DG challenged the\nlocus standi\nof the second\r\nto nineteenth appellants on the basis that an application for asylum\r\nis individual in nature and that each applicant\nhad to set out facts\r\nin relation to his or her asylum claim, which in the present case, so\r\nit was contended, was not done by the\nsecond to nineteenth\r\nappellants. The Minister and the DG pointed out that none of them had\r\nset out facts relating specifically\nto them, relying merely on the\r\ngeneral allegations of political persecution in their country of\r\norigin made by the first appellant.\n[11] The Minister and the\r\nDG justified the arrest of the appellants on the basis of the\r\nprovisions of s 9(4) of the Immigration\nAct 13 of 2002 (the IA)\nread with s 1 thereof.\r\nSection 9(4) provides that:\n‘\nA\r\nforeigner who is not the holder of a permanent residence permit may\r\nonly enter the Republic as contemplated in this section if\n(a) his or\r\nher passport is valid for not less than 30 days after the expiry of\r\nthe intended stay; and (b) issued with a valid temporary\nresidence\r\npermit, as set out in this Act.’\n[12] I interpose to state\r\nthat the validity of the arrest was unchallenged by the appellants.\r\nIt is what transpired thereafter that\nwas in issue.\n[13] The Minister and the\r\nDG admitted that the appellants had been transferred to Lindela,\r\npending deportation. The Minister and\nthe DG were adamant that the\r\nappellants had been notified of the decision to deport them. In their\r\nopposing affidavit they asserted\nthat the appellants’ right to\r\nappeal the decision had been explained and incorporated in a\r\n‘notification of deportation’.\nThe Minister and the DG\r\nproduced such a document which they alleged contained the signatures\r\nof the appellants. According to the\nMinister and the DG an\r\ninterpreter had been employed to ensure proper communication with the\r\nappellants. The Minister and the DG\npointed out that at no stage\r\nduring the period before the appellants saw their attorneys did they\r\nindicate an intention to apply\nfor asylum.\n[14] It is common cause\r\nthat subsequent to the appellants’ detention at Lindela the\r\nDepartment of Home Affairs requested the\nEthiopian Embassy to issue\r\nemergency travel certificates to the appellants to facilitate their\r\ndeportation. The Embassy refused\nto do so, on the basis that the\r\nappellants were unwilling to return.\n[15] According to the\r\ndeponent to the affidavit in support of the Minister and the DG’s\r\ncase, Mr Joseph Swartland, who is\nan Assistant Director in the\r\nDepartment stationed at the Lindela holding facility, he personally\r\nhad advised the appellants on\n8 July 2011 that there was a need for\r\nhim to apply for an extension of their detention on the basis of\r\ntheir Embassy’s refusal\nto co-operate. Mr Swartland alleged\r\nthat most of the appellants remained silent whilst some had insisted\r\non seeing a member of\ntheir Embassy. It appears that such a meeting\r\nwas not facilitated by officials of the Department.\n[16] On 14 July 2011, the\r\nDepartment applied for the extension of the appellants’\r\ndetention. On 19 July 2011 the Magistrates’\nCourt granted an\r\norder extending the detention of the appellants for 90 days.\n[17] On the merits of the\r\nappellants’ claim for asylum the Minister and the DG denied\r\nthat the appellants qualified as asylum\nseekers. They denied that the\r\nappellants had made applications for asylum and contended that a\r\nperson may only be recognised as\na refugee after a proper application\r\nin terms of the provisions of the RA.\n[18] The Minister and the\r\nDG contended that the appellants’ failure to provide details\r\nconcerning the nature of their political\npersecution in Ethiopia\r\nshould be held against them. Significantly, Mr Swartland, in the\r\nanswering affidavit, stated that he did\nnot know how, why and when\r\nthe appellants had left Ethiopia. He also questioned the appellants’\r\nfailure to seek protection\nin any of the countries through which they\r\ntravelled en route to South Africa.\n[19] The following\r\nextract from Mr Swartland’s affidavit is significant:\n’\n62.3\r\nI am advised that whether or not the Applicants qualify to apply for\r\nasylum is a decision or an administrative act which should\nbe\r\nexercised by the Respondents. I am advised that a court may interfere\r\nwith administrative actions only if they are not exercised\nreasonably\r\nor they are not exercised at all. This practice is consistent with\r\nour constitutional jurisprudence.\n62/4 The Applicants seek\r\nan order which will amount to the Court resuming the functions of the\r\nExecutive. More over, there is no\nsuggestion that the Applicants\r\napproached or intimidated an intention to apply for asylum prior to\r\ntheir application being dismissed\nin Court.’\n[20]\r\nMr Swartland postulated that there was no legal obligation on the\r\npart of the Department’s officials at Lindela to transport\nany\r\nperson detained, pending deportation, to a refugee reception office,\r\nto enable an application for asylum to be made, if that\nperson had\r\nfailed to do so himself or herself. Mr Swartland contended that\r\nthe appellants were required to exhaust the internal\nremedies\r\nprovided for in s 8 of the IA,\n3\nbefore an approach to\r\ncourt and that only exceptional circumstances justified prior\r\njudicial review.\n[21]\r\nIn the replying affidavit the appellants reiterated and emphasised\r\nthat the court was not being asked to adjudicate the merits\nof their\r\nclaim for asylum. It was being asked to order that they be provided\r\nan opportunity to apply for refugee status. They also\ndenied having\r\nmet Mr Swartland. They pointed out that Regulation 28(4)(a) of the\r\nregulations promulgated under the IA,\n4\nrequires an immigration\r\nofficer to serve a notification of intention to extend the period of\r\ndetention on the person concerned personally\nin a form substantially\r\ncorresponding to that which is prescribed.\n5\nNo such notice had in\r\nfact been served on the appellants. They all denied having been\r\nafforded an opportunity to make representations\nagainst their\r\ncontinued detention.\n[22] Faced with all the\r\nallegations referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the court below\r\nfollowed a disturbingly peculiar procedure\nbefore deciding the\r\nmatter. The court below considered it imperative to determine at the\r\noutset whether the application before\nHattingh AJ had been authorised\r\nby the appellant. That in itself is not objectionable. It is the\r\nmanner in which that exercise\nwas embarked on that is a cause for\r\nconcern and it is dealt with in the paragraphs that follow.\n[23] The court below\r\nsummoned the attorney and advocate who had purportedly represented\r\nthe appellants in the prior proceedings\nbefore Hattingh AJ to court.\r\nThe record of proceedings in the court below indicates that the judge\r\nenquired of the attorney whether\nhe had acted on the authority of the\r\nappellants. The attorney’s response was that he had never heard\r\nof the matter before.\nHe denied any knowledge of the prior\r\napplication. According to the attorney he knew the advocate who was\r\non record as the appellants’\nrepresentative before Hattingh AJ\r\nas he had briefed him in two matters on other occasions. The attorney\r\nstated that he had not\nbriefed anyone on the appellants’ behalf\r\nin the matter and said that he did not even know them, to which the\r\njudge responded\nas follows:\n‘\nSo,\r\nI am going to stop [the advocate] from doing this, he is pretending\r\nthat he is getting instructions from you. Who else could\nhave given\r\nhim instructions from your office?’\n[24] In response to the\r\nlast question in the preceding paragraph the attorney said there was\r\nno one else in his office that could\nhave done so. A little later the\r\nattorney stated that the signature on the court documents before\r\nHattingh AJ was not his. The\nattorney went on to state that he had\r\nnot been practicing in the preceding months. This meant that he could\r\nnot possibly have been\ninvolved in the application before Hattingh\r\nAJ.\n[25] Even though the\r\nattorney had not been sworn in as a witness, the court below afforded\r\nthe Minister’s representative as\nwell as counsel for the\r\nappellants an opportunity to question him. In this regard the court\r\nsaid the following:\n‘\nI\r\nmean, I do not want to make a finding in implicating your company’s\r\nname without giving you an opportunity to be heard and\nI am not\r\ntaking evidence under oath, I just want to give you an opportunity to\r\nbe right. Yes.’\n[26] After the attorney\r\nhad been questioned the advocate who purportedly had represented the\r\nappellants before Hattingh AJ was called.\nHe was also questioned by\r\nthe court below without having been sworn in and before he said\r\nanything the judge said the following:\n‘\n[I]\r\nmade certain statements concerning you, before I had the opportunity\r\nto read the papers and I also relied on what was told to\nme from the\r\nbar, to the extent of your absence I might have offended your ─\r\nfor integrity I want to in open court apologise.\nI have now had the\r\nopportunity to read the papers and I see that you are the author of\r\nthe letter to the Lawyers for Human Rights,\nwhen you say, please help\r\nthese people.’\n[27] Almost immediately\r\nthereafter the judge stated:\n‘\nAnd\r\nI also see that there is an averment in the papers that you phoned\r\nthe deponent to the affidavit on behalf of the respondents\nwhen you\r\nwere at the police station. I infer from that that when you were at\r\nthe police station, you were there to consult with\nthe people who\r\nwere detained. So it cannot be suggested that you had no authority,\r\nwhether you were properly mandated in terms\nof the Law Society Rules\r\nor the Bar Rules, I am not concerned about that. I am concerned about\r\nthe fraud on the court. So to that\nextent, I want to say to you that\r\nI want to apologise to you. I certainly will not make any adverse\r\nfindings about you regarding\nwhether you had authority to act for\r\nthem or not by virtue of those two independent facts. But having said\r\nthat, I must say to\nyou the allegations are made that you had no\r\nauthority. The attorney who says he instructed you came to court and\r\nsays he did not\ninstruct you. That is the position. Is there anything\r\nyou want to say to the court?’\nAs can be seen from what\r\nappears early in the aforesaid passage it is the judge’s view\r\non whether or not the prior application\nhad been authorised that is\r\nrecorded rather than the view of the ‘witness’.\n[28] The advocate went on\r\nto state that he had seen the appellants at the police station, to\r\nwhich the court responded:\n‘\nSo\r\nI do not understand how the Lawyers for Human Rights can come to me\r\nand say to me that you had no authority to act for them.\nThis is\r\nclearly a second bite to the cherry.’\n[29] When the advocate\r\nconcerned stated that if the appellants were to be asked, he was\r\ncertain that one of them would be able to\nidentify him, the court\r\nbelow said the following:\n‘\nWell\r\nif I had known of that fact I would not have called for oral\r\nevidence.’\n[30] When counsel for the\r\nappellants sought to intervene, the judge stated:\n‘\nI\r\nwill allow this, please do not interrupt. This is an officer of the\r\ncourt. I am not prepared to take [the applicants’] word\nagainst\r\nan officer of the court.’\n[31] The court below then\r\nrepeatedly stated that if the appellants had a complaint against the\r\nadvocate and attorney they should\npursue it through another forum. He\r\nwent on to state that the Law Society and the Bar Council could be\r\napproached in this regard.\n[32] Questioned by\r\ncounsel for the appellants, the advocate concerned said the\r\nfollowing:\n‘\nYou\r\nsee, when I received the file, I was at the stage when entering the\r\ncourt, because the day, the previous evening when [the attorney]\n\nrelated the matter to me, he instructed me, he said to me, in the\r\nmorning ─ because I had matters in Kempton Park, I had\na matter\r\nin Kempton Park, so I said, I will just go quickly argue this matter\r\nfor you, you know an urgent application, because\nI have been giving\r\nurgent applications. So I just did that. But now, when he gave me the\r\nfile, I just took the file and went through\nthe affidavit to confirm\r\nwhat I know and then that was all I argued. I never noticed any\r\ndifference in the signature of affidavits,\nI never did that. The only\r\nthing after I got the . . .[indistinct] from the Lawyers for Human\r\nRights, I realised that, even the\ncommissioning was done in\r\nJohannesburg with the guys out there, that is why I had a problem and\r\nthen I immediately reported the\nmatter to the Law Society. That was\r\nwhere I realised that ─ even my colleague phoned for the\r\nrespondents here did not notice\nthat, you see.’\nThese statements are far\r\nfrom clear and totally unhelpful.\n[33] As noted above these\r\nwere motion proceedings. That notwithstanding, after the judge had\r\nquestioned the advocate, he invited\nany of the parties to call such\r\nwitnesses as they thought fit. It did not appear that he was at that\r\nstage restricting such contemplated\nevidence solely to the question\r\nwhether the proceedings before Hattingh JA had been properly\r\nauthorised.\n[34] Counsel for the\r\nappellants was willing to lead evidence on ‘some of the\r\nconcerns the court had about the veracity of\ntheir account of how\r\nthey had entered South Africa, but submitted that it was irrelevant\r\nto the issues that fell to be decided.\n[35] After an exchange\r\nbetween the court and counsel for the appellants, the first appellant\r\nwas sworn in and proceeded to testify.\nHe had hardly begun testifying\r\nabout how he had crossed the border and travelled to Johannesburg\r\nduring the night when the judge\ninterrupted and asked how he came to\r\nknow about the existence of Johannesburg. His response was that\r\neverybody knew about Johannesburg.\nHe went on to explain that he had\r\nasked passers-by for directions to Johannesburg, when the court\r\ninterrupted once again, and incredibly,\nsaid the following:\n‘\nNo\r\nman you cannot just, I am not a child. Tell him I am not a child. I\r\ndo not want to believe him if he is telling me he walked\nat night\r\nfrom the border to Johannesburg by asking people, show me the\r\ndirection of Johannesburg. This is not fairytales please,\ntell him\r\nthis is not fairytales, he must speak honest with me. If he wants me\r\nto help him, he must be honest with me. I will look\nfor a way to help\r\nhim, but I cannot help a person who wants refugee in this country,\r\nwho is not prepared to be frank and honest\nwith the authorities and\r\ncertainly if he is not frank with the court, I am not going to help\r\nhim.’\n[36] After the first\r\nappellant testified that it had taken him one week to walk from the\r\nborder to Johannesburg the judge directed\nthe following at counsel\r\nfor the appellants:\n‘\nThe\r\nversion has got to be probable Ms de Vos, the versions has got to be\r\nprobable. I mean if I end up at the Heathrow Airport and\nI tell an\r\nEnglish officer that I came by way of sea and I landed on the shores\r\nof the UK and I walked to London, they will not\nbelieve me. There is\r\nno difference ─ the standard should be [no] different in South\r\nAfrica.’\n[37] The first appellant\r\nwas subjected to fairly extensive cross-examination by counsel for\r\nthe Minister and the DG, without any\nsignificant negative effect.\r\nDuring the cross-examination the judge interrupted numerous times.\r\nThe following four passages are\nsome examples of the nature and tenor\r\nof the judicial intervention:\n‘\nI\r\ncan ensure you, I looked very hard to try and assist people here, if\r\nthey came here and they say listen never mind what happened,\nI want\r\nto come clean now, this is how I came here, somebody promised me\r\nthis, this, this, this and if they come clean, I would\nnot have that\r\nproblem to look hard in the law and find the basis to assist them,\r\nwhether I can ultimately or not, is another matter.\nBut at least I\r\nwill then dig deep into the jurisprudence.\n. . .\nAnyway it does not matter\r\nwhat Lawyers for Human Rights says, I am committed to this country, I\r\ndo not want this country to be ungovernable,\nI like people from all\r\nover the world to come here, but they must work within the\r\nstructures. If my client comes to me and says\nto me, look, this is a\r\nproblem I find myself, then I tell my client, there is right ways of\r\ndoing it and there is wrong ways of\ndoing it. They found a Judge,\r\nthey are not going to be unsympathetic to you, because you come from\r\nAfrica, you want to better your\nlife, let us see how we can do it,\r\nbut I am not going to go on the version. If you take on review, the\r\nConstitutional Court can\nsay what they want about me, but I am not\r\ngoing to take a version. That is for baby class stuff. You cannot\r\nseriously [contend]\nthat in a court of law that I must accept that\r\nthey came in the middle of the night and walked from the border to\r\nJohannesburg.\nTry to give that explanation in any Western country,\r\nyou will be put on a flight that same afternoon and deport you, well\r\nwhat\nis different from us? Why do we being deeming ourselves, why are\r\nour standards any lower, because we are in Africa? It cannot be\nright\r\nMs Manaka [counsel for the Ministers and the DG].\n. . .\nBut now your version, I\r\nnever came to seek asylum, I wanted to be illegally in this country,\r\nthat is what he is saying to me and\nto say that he does not know\r\nEnglish, when he knows the English alphabet, I am not prepared to\r\naccept that. There is truthfulness\nand there is falseness, a legal\r\nsystem that cannot pursue the true facts, can never survive.\n. . .\nYou must first get the\r\nproper facts and then you decide under the law whether you can assist\r\na person or not. I mean, we are obviously\nsympathetic to their\r\nplight, I would rather help them than wealthy gangsters that come\r\nfrom Eastern Europe and some of them become\nleading members of our\r\nsociety. I would rather help people who applied, but they must come\r\nhere and they must be properly advised\nto come and talk the truth.’\n[38] During the first\r\nappellant’s cross-examination the judge, through the\r\ninterpreter, put it to Mr Bula that in his view\nsomebody had\r\ntransported the appellants from the border to Johannesburg. When that\r\nwas denied, the judge responded as follows:\n‘\nThat\r\nsounds more probable to me, it sounds more real and if somebody\r\ntransported him, on the fact that they transported him from\nthe\r\nborder to Johannesburg does not make it illegal, somebody who\r\ntransports you, does not make it illegal.’\n[39] Counsel representing\r\nthe Minister and the DG then sought the leave of the court to put it\r\nto the first appellant that he had\nbeen assisted by a syndicate\r\ninvolved in human trafficking. The court below responded as follows:\n‘\nI\r\nwill allow it Ma’am, because that is the only way they could\r\nhave come into this country and I will allow that and we must\nget to\r\nthe bottom of this, we must stop syndicates and we must allow people\r\nto come in lawfully and apply for refugee. It is a\ndeserving case\r\nthen he must apply.’\n[40] At this stage\r\ncounsel representing the appellants objected on the grounds that no\r\nsuch basis had been laid in the affidavits\nfiled on behalf of the\r\nMinster and the DG. The judge reacted in the following manner:\n‘\nYou\r\nsee, it is human trafficking, you see Mayfair is known where there is\r\na lot of foreign African communities and one must look\nat\r\nprobabilities and one must deal with these things here, because\r\notherwise . . . [intervenes].’\nThe first appellant\r\ndenied that he had been transported to Johannesburg by a syndicate or\r\nby anyone else.\n[41] What is set out in\r\nthe preceding paragraphs on the manner in which proceedings were\r\nconducted will be commented on later in\nthis judgment. In the\r\nparagraphs that follow I set out the conclusions arrived at by the\r\ncourt below.\n[42] In its judgment the\r\ncourt below considered whether there was any basis on which the order\r\nof Hattingh AJ dismissing the prior\napplication could be set aside.\r\nHe stated that it was not necessary to decide the propriety of the\r\nconduct of the attorney and\nadvocate concerned as that was a matter\r\nfor their regulatory bodies. He went on to state that he could not\r\ndetermine the dispute\non this issue on the material before him, but\r\nthen, rather strangely, went on to record that that was not the end\r\nof the debate.\nHe thought it necessary to consider whether ‘others’\r\nmay have instructed the attorney or the advocate concerned and\n\nproceeded to determine that dispute.\n[43] The court below, in\r\ndeciding whether the application before Hattingh AJ had been properly\r\nauthorised by the appellants, thought\nit important that the founding\r\naffidavit in that application had been signed before a Commissioner\r\nof Oaths and that the first\nappellant had been referred to by his\r\nproper name. The court below considered the arrest of the appellants,\r\nthe warrants of detention\nin relation to them and the notifications\r\nof deportation issued to each. It weighed those facts against what it\r\nregarded to be\nthe appellants’ improbable version of events. It\r\nreached the following conclusion:\n‘\nOn\r\nthe probabilities, these applicants were part of a syndicate bringing\r\nforeigners unlawfully into this country. This is illegal\nand cannot\r\nbe countenanced. This explains the recruitment of lawyers to make the\r\nfirst application.’\n[44] Immediately after\r\nthe quoted passage the court below stated that it was not prepared to\r\nfind that the advocate involved before\nHattingh AJ had no authority.\r\nIn para 34 of its judgment the court below said the following:\n‘\nI\r\nthink the new sets of lawyers are unduly critical of the conduct of\r\n[the advocate]. He put a case on short notice as best as he\ncould to\r\nassist the applicants. They have a bad case and this is not the fault\r\nof counsel. What other motive would [the advocate]\nhave had? Those\r\nsympathetic to the plight of the applicants or more probably those\r\nwho arranged their entry into the country recruited\nlawyers to assist\r\nthe applicants.’\n[45] The court below went\r\non to hold that the first application had been properly authorised\r\nand that a case had not been made for\nsetting aside the order made by\r\nHattingh AJ. It did, however, take into account that the case\r\ninvolved the liberty of individuals\nand was willing to consider the\r\napplication ‘afresh’.\n[46] In deciding the\r\nmerits of the application the court below accepted a submission by\r\ncounsel representing the appellants, namely,\nthat an applicant for\r\nasylum was not restricted to applying for asylum only at border\r\nposts. It nonetheless concluded that if,\non the probabilities, the\r\nappellants were found to be party to a scheme to illegally import\r\nthem into the country, they should\nnot be afforded an opportunity to\r\napply for asylum because such application could not be said to be\r\nbona fide.\n[47] In the view of the\r\ncourt below the appellants had never really sought to apply for\r\nasylum. It held that their alleged intention\nto apply for asylum was\r\nan afterthought, designed to defeat the decision to deport them. The\r\nview of the court below concerning\nthe entry of foreigners into the\r\ncountry, as was evident from the interventions referred to above, is\r\nrepeated in para 62 of his\njudgment:\n‘\nI\r\ncannot accept that 19 applicants, without any connecting factor in\r\nthis country, can be set free to roam the streets of our country\nas\r\nwould be the effect of this court releasing the applicants. That will\r\nbe tantamount to irresponsible and reckless conduct on\nthe part of\r\nthe authorities and this court. Assuming one or more of them were\r\nthen to commit a crime, the victim will then seek\nto hold the State\r\nliable for releasing a detainee without any connecting factor and who\r\nsubsequently engages in wrongful conduct.\nNo organisation or body of\r\nresponsible people such as for instance the Ethiopian community now\r\nsettled in Johannesburg were prepared\nto accept any responsibility\r\nfor the conduct of these individuals upon their release. I make this\r\nobservation because when I considered\nPart B of the application,\r\nthere was in attendance two representatives of the Ethiopian\r\ncommunity who showed some interest in the\nmatter.’\n[48] In evaluating the\r\nevidence by the first appellant, the judge held that the appellants’\r\nversion of how they travelled\nto South Africa was far-fetched. In its\r\njudgment, the court below repeated its scepticism of the description\r\nby the appellants\nof how they travelled from Ethiopia to South\r\nAfrica. He held that their version was ‘selective, unhelpful\r\nand not frank’.\n[49] The court below\r\nnoted the submission on behalf of the appellants that they had not\r\nbeen notified in writing, in accordance\nwith the peremptory\r\nprovisions of Regulation 28(4)(a) of the regulations promulgated\r\nunder the IA, that the immigration officer\nconcerned intended to\r\napply to court for an extension of their detention. The court below\r\nrecorded that the Minister and the DG\naccepted that there had been no\r\nsuch written notification. It did, however, take into account in\r\nfavour of the Minister and the\nDG, Swartland’s assertions, in\r\nthe opposing affidavit, that he had advised the appellants verbally\r\nthat there would be a\nneed to apply for the extension of their\r\ndetention on the basis that the Embassy had refused to identify them\r\nand issue emergency\ntravel documents to facilitate their deportation.\r\nAccording to Mr Swartland they had also been specifically asked\r\nwhether they\nhad representations to make to the court and some of\r\nthem had said that they wished to see members of their Embassy.\n[50] In the view of the\r\ncourt below there had been substantial compliance with the regulation\r\nrequiring written notification. The\ncourt below went on to state the\r\nfollowing:\n‘\nThirdly,\r\nby elevating the requirement of regulation 28(4)(a) as inflexible\r\nwould be tantamount to rendering the provisions of the\nImmigration\nAct requiring\na foreigner to have permission to be in this country\r\nnugatory. The law should not be interpreted in a manner to give\r\nlegitimacy\nto illegality. Fourthly, in weighing up the public\r\ninterests as compared to the interests of the applicants, I take the\r\nview that\nform should not outweigh substance. The public interests\r\nwarrant safeguards whereby individuals who are illegally in this\r\ncountry\nshould not be permitted to be released without any\r\nsafeguards. On the other hand of the spectrum, the applicants cannot\r\nhave an\nexpectation of converting their illegal entry and illegal\r\nabode in this country to being freed on a technicality which does not\n\nserve to fortify any fundamental or elementary right.’\n[51]\r\nMisunderstanding where the onus resides in respect of justifying the\r\nappellants’ continued detention\n6\nthe court below stated\r\nthat the appellants had no defence against their continued detention.\r\nIt was adamant that it could not give\na construction to the\r\napplicable legislation that would legitimise illegal foreigners being\r\npermitted to be in this country. In\nthe concluding part of its\r\nreasoning the court below said the following:\n‘\nSuch\r\na construction would be detrimental and destructive of the law which\r\nrequires a foreigner to have legal status to be in this\ncountry.’\n[52] I have set out the\r\nmanner in which the court below conducted proceedings in some detail\r\nbecause it is a matter of grave concern\nwhen fundamental rules of\r\nlitigation are so flagrantly flouted. The court below misconceived\r\nits function and misidentified the\nissues that called for decision.\n[53]\r\nFirst, there had been no request for a referral to oral evidence. It\r\nis generally undesirable that a court\nmero\r\nmotu\norders\r\na referral to oral evidence.\n7\nHaving resorted to that\r\nwhich is undesirable, and without directions as to issues or\r\nprocedure,\n8\nfurther peculiar\r\nprocedures followed. The first two witnesses were not sworn in. In\r\nrespect of the advocate alleged to have been\ninvolved in the\r\napplication before Hattingh AJ, the judge in the court below said\r\nvery early on, before hearing any of the appellants\nthat he would\r\ntake the advocate’s word above the word of the appellants on\r\nwhether or not the former had been properly authorised.\nThis is\r\njudicial conduct that is fundamentally unacceptable. Procedural rules\r\nand the rules of evidence exist for a reason. It\nis to ensure that\r\njustice is done between litigants. Witnesses too should, in\r\naccordance with constitutional values, be treated\nfairly and with\r\ndignity.\n[54] Right at the\r\nbeginning of the first appellant’s evidence-in-chief, the judge\r\nstarted making factual findings, indulged\nin pontification and was\r\npatronising. A judge is required to wait until all the relevant\r\nevidence has been adduced and after hearing\nsubmissions from legal\r\nrepresentatives before making an assessment and reaching conclusions.\r\nThe repeated interventions set out\nin some detail earlier in this\r\njudgment are also judicially unacceptable. Judges are impartial\r\nadjudicators. They do not enter\nthe fray in the manner set out above.\n[55] Statements by the\r\ncourt below concerning foreigners were far from tempered. They caused\r\nthe court to be blinkered to the issues\nthat called for decision. The\r\nstatements have the potential for creating and heightening tensions\r\nbetween nationals and foreigners.\nIf they are not prudent\r\nextra-judicially they must be all the more unacceptable in court.\n[56] Furthermore, the\r\nconclusions of the court below concerning a syndicate involving human\r\ntrafficking have no basis in any of\nthe evidence, written or oral. It\r\nwas wrong to allow cross-examination on an issue not raised in the\r\nopposing affidavits. The cross-examination\nand the conclusions of the\r\ncourt below were based on pure supposition. Judicial officers should\r\nguard against preconceived views.\nIt is the very antithesis of the\r\nsupremacy of the rule of law which is a founding constitutional\r\nvalue.\n[57] The respondents\r\ncorrectly did not seek to support the findings of the court below in\r\nrelation to the question whether the proceedings\nbefore Hattingh AJ\r\nwere properly authorised. Given the nature of the ‘evidence’\r\nby the attorney and the advocate\nconcerned and the conduct of the\r\njudge in this regard and that the liberty of the appellants was at\r\nstake, the attitude of counsel\nfor the respondents in this court is\r\ncommendable. Counsel representing the Minister and the DG, quite\r\ncorrectly, right at the outset\ndistanced themselves from the manner\r\nin which proceedings were conducted in the court below.\n[58] I now intend to deal\r\nwith the approach that ought to have been followed in the court\r\nbelow. At the outset it is necessary to\nunderstand the purposes\r\nserved by the RA and to appreciate the manner in which it is\r\nstructured. The preamble correctly states\nthat the Act is designed to\r\ngive effect within the Republic of South Africa to the relevant\r\ninternational instruments, principles\nand standards relating to\r\nrefugees and to provide for the reception into South Africa of asylum\r\nseekers. The Act quite clearly\nregulates applications for and\r\nrecognition of refugee status and provides for the rights and\r\nobligations flowing from that status.\n[59] Most importantly,\r\nthe provisions of s 2 of the RA read as follows:\n‘\nNotwithstanding\r\nany provisions of this Act or any other law to the contrary, no\r\nperson may be refused entry into the Republic, expelled,\nextradited\r\nor returned to any other country or be subject to any similar\r\nmeasure, if as a result of such refusal, expulsion, extradition,\n\nreturn or other measure, such person is compelled to return to or\r\nremain in a country where─\n(a)\nhe or she may be subjected to persecution on account of\r\nhis or her race, religion, nationality, political opinion or\r\nmembership\nof a particular social group; or\n(b)\nhis or her life, physical safety or freedom would be\r\nthreatened on account of external aggression, occupation, foreign\r\ndomination\nor other events seriously disturbing or disrupting public\r\norder in either part or the whole of that country.’\n[60] Section 3 of the Act\r\nstates that subject to Chapter 3, which provides procedures for\r\napplicants for asylum to follow, a person\nqualifies for refugee\r\nstatus, if that person─\n‘\n(a)\nowing\r\nto a well-founded fear of being persecuted by reason of his or her\r\nrace, tribe, religion, nationality, political opinion or\nmembership\r\nof a particular social group, is outside the country of his or her\r\nnationality and is unable or unwilling to avail himself\nor herself of\r\nthe protection of that country of his or her former habitual\r\nresidence is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling\nto return to\r\nit; or\n(b)\nowing to external aggression, occupation, foreign\r\ndomination or events seriously disturbing or disrupting public order\r\nin either\na part or the whole of this or her country of origin or\r\nnationality, is compelled to leave his or her place of habitual\r\nresidence\nin order to seek refuge elsewhere; or\n(c)\nis a dependant of a person contemplated in paragraph\n(a)\nor\n(b)\n.\n[61]\r\nIn\nAbdi v Minister of Home Affairs\n2011\r\n(3) SA 37\n(SCA) para 22, this court noted that the provisions of the\r\nAct referred to in the preceding paragraph mirror those of the 1951\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1969\r\nOrganisation of African Unity Convention. In para 22 of\nAbdi\nthis court went on to say that these\r\nprovisions ‘patently prohibit the prevention of access to the\r\nRepublic of any person\nwho has been forced to flee the country of his\r\nor her birth because of any of the circumstances identified in s 2 of\r\nthe Act’.\n[62] Section 8 of the RA\r\nempowers the DG to establish as many Refugee Reception Offices as\r\nnecessary for the purposes of the RA.\nIt is common cause that such an\r\noffice exists at the Mozambique/South Africa border but not at\r\nLindela.\n[63] Section 9 of the RA\r\nprovides for a Standing Committee for Refugee Affairs (the SCRA),\r\nwhich has the power, inter alia, to formulate\nand implement\r\nprocedures for the granting of asylum.\n[64] Section 21 of the RA\r\nis of importance in the present case. Section 21(1) provides:\n‘\nAn\r\napplication for asylum must be made in person in accordance with the\r\nprescribed procedures to a Refugee Reception Officer at\nany Refugee\r\nReception Office.’\n[65] In terms of s 21(2)\r\na Refugee Reception Officer (RRO) is obliged to accept an application\r\nfor asylum and, if required, must\nassist an applicant to complete the\r\nnecessary application forms. An RRO is required to submit any\r\napplication received together\nwith relevant information to a Refugee\r\nStatus Determination Officer (RSDO) to be dealt with in terms of s\r\n24, the relevant provisions\nof which will be set out and discussed in\r\nlater paragraphs.\n[66] In terms of s 22(1)\r\nof the RA, an RRO ‘must, pending the outcome of an application\r\nin terms of section 21(1), issue to\nthe applicant an asylum seeker\r\npermit in the prescribed form allowing the applicant to sojourn in\r\nthe Republic temporarily, subject\nto any conditions, determined by\r\nthe Standing Committee, which are not in conflict with the\r\nConstitution or international law and\nare endorsed by the Refugee\r\nReception Officer on the permit’.\n[67] Section 22(6)\r\nenables the Department of Home Affairs to withdraw an asylum seeker\r\npermit under certain conditions. Section\n26 gives the power to an\r\nRSDO to determine whether the applicant for asylum is entitled\r\nthereto. Section 24(3) provides as follows:\n‘\nThe\r\nRefugee Status Determination Officer must at the conclusion of the\r\nhearing ─\n(a)\ngrant asylum; or\n(b)\nreject the application as\r\nmanifestly unfounded, abusive or fraudulent; or\n(c)\nreject the application as\r\nunfounded; or\n(d)\nrefer any question of law\r\nto the Standing Committee.’\n[68] Significantly, in\r\nterms of s 25(1) of the RA, the Standing Committee is obliged to\r\nreview any decision taken by an RSDO in\nterms of s 24(3)(b). This\r\nprovision was clearly intended to ensure that deserving applicants\r\nare not wrongfully turned away. This\nin turn ensures that South\r\nAfrica meets its international obligations.\n[69] Section 27 sets out\r\nthe protections and rights that are conferred by refugee status.\r\nSection 38 empowers the Minister to make\nregulations, inter alia, for\r\nany matter necessary or expedient in order that the objects of the\r\nAct may be achieved.\n[70] An important\r\nregulation in this regard is Regulation 2 of the regulations under\r\nthe RA which provides:\n‘\n2(1)\r\nAn application for asylum in terms of section 21 of the Act:\n(a) must be lodged by the\r\napplicant in person at a designated Refugee Reception Office without\r\ndelay;\n(b) must be in the form\r\nand contain substantially the information prescribed in Annexure 1 to\r\nthese Regulations; and\n(c) must be completed in\r\nduplicate.\n(2) Any person who\r\nentered the Republic and is encountered in violation of the Aliens\r\nControl Act, who has not submitted an application\npursuant to\r\nsubregulation 2(1), but indicates an intention to apply for asylum\r\nshall be issued with an appropriate permit valid\nfor 14 days within\r\nwhich they must approach a Refugee Reception Office to complete an\r\nasylum application.’\n[71]\r\nIn para 24 of\nAbdi\nthis court noted that the\r\nprovisions of the Act are in accordance with international law and\r\npractice as evidenced by decisions\nof the European Court of Human\r\nRights.\n[72]\r\nRegulation 2(2) ought to have been the starting point as the\r\nappellants clearly fell within its ambit. They had not lodged\nan\r\napplication within the terms set out in Regulation 2(1)(a). The word\r\n‘encountered’ in Regulation 2(2) must be given\nits\r\nordinary meaning which is to meet or come across unexpectedly.\n9\nThe regulation does not\r\nrequire an individual to indicate an intention to apply for asylum\r\nimmediately he or she is encountered,\nnor should it be interpreted as\r\nmeaning that when the person does not do so there and then he or she\r\nis precluded from doing so\nthereafter. The purpose of subsection 2 is\r\nclearly to ensure that where a foreign national indicates an\r\nintention to apply for\nasylum, the regulatory framework of the RA\r\nkicks in, ultimately to ensure that genuine asylum seekers are not\r\nturned away. It is\nclear that the appellants, when they were detained\r\nat Lindela, communicated to the Department’s officials and\r\nenforcement\nofficers by the letter referred to earlier in this\r\njudgment that they intended to apply for asylum. Once the appellants,\r\nthrough\ntheir attorneys, indicated an intention to apply for asylum\r\nthey became entitled to be treated in terms of Regulation 2(2) and to\n\nbe issued with an appropriate permit valid for 14 days, within which\r\nthey were obliged to approach a Refugee Reception Office to\ncomplete\r\nan asylum application. The contrary view expressed in\nShabangu\r\nv Minister of Home Affairs\n(49231/10)\r\n[2010] ZAGPJHC 146 (10 December 2010) is incorrect. The order in that\r\ncase had the effect of placing the persons released\ninto an\r\nunregulated position, which could never have been the intention of\r\nthe RA.\n[73]\r\nThat does not mean that a decision on the\nbona\r\nfides\nof the application is made upfront.\r\nOnce the application has been made at a Refugee Reception Office, in\r\nterms of s 21 of the RA,\nthe Refugee Reception Officer is obliged to\r\naccept it, see to it that it is properly completed, render such\r\nassistance as may be\nnecessary and then ensure that the application\r\ntogether with the relevant information is referred to a RSDO.\n[74] In terms of s 22 of\r\nthe RA an asylum seeker has the protection of the law pending the\r\ndetermination of his application for\nasylum. To that end he or she is\r\nentitled to an asylum seeker permit entitling a sojourn in South\r\nAfrica. As can be seen from the\nprovisions of s 24(3) set out in para\r\n67 above it is for the RSDO and the RSDO alone to grant or reject an\r\napplication for asylum.\nIn terms of s 24(3)(c) the application could\r\nbe rejected on the basis of being ‘unfounded’.\n[75]\r\nBefore us the Minister and the DG relied on the following sentences\r\nin para 22 of the judgment of this court in\nAbdi\n:\n‘\nRefugees\r\nentitled to be recognised as such may more often than not arrive at a\r\nport of entry without the necessary documentation\nand be placed in an\r\ninadmissible facility. Such persons have a right to apply for refugee\r\nstatus, and it is unlawful to refuse\nthem entry\nif\r\nthey are bona fide in seeking refuge\n.’\r\n(My emphasis.)\nIt\r\nwas contended on behalf of the Minister and the DG that particularly\r\nthe last sentence meant that the question whether an application\nfor\r\nasylum was\nbona fide\nshould\r\nbe addressed at the outset and can be interrogated by a court as was\r\ndone by the court below. In this regard it was submitted\nthat the\r\ncourt below was correct in its scepticism of the description by the\r\nappellants of their journey to Johannesburg. They\ncontended that it\r\nshould be held against the appellants that they had not used the\r\nfirst available opportunity to indicate their\nintention to apply for\r\nasylum and that there was thus a basis for concluding as the court\r\nbelow did that the application for asylum\nwas an afterthought\r\ncalculated to thwart deportation. On the aforesaid grounds they\r\ncontend that it could rightly be said upfront\nthat the application\r\nfor asylum was not\nbona fide\nand\r\nthat consequently the appellants were not entitled to the relief\r\nsought in the court below.\n[76]\r\nI disagree with the suggested approach. After the passage in\nAbdi\nrelied upon by the Minister and the DG the very next\r\nsentence reads as follows:\n‘\nThe\r\nDepartment’s officials have a duty to ensure that intending\r\napplicants for refugee status are given every reasonable opportunity\n\nto file an application with the relevant refugee reception office ─\r\nunless the intending applicant is excluded in terms of\ns 4 of the\r\nAct.’\nIt was agreed by the\r\nparties that s 4 of the Act has no application to the present\r\ncircumstances.\n[77]\r\nAs is abundantly clear the scheme of the Act is that it is for the\r\nRSDO to determine the merits of an application for asylum\nand not for\r\na prior interrogation by a court. In the passage in\nAbdi\n,\r\nrelied on by the Minister and the DG, this court was stating the\r\nobvious. It does not follow that in the passage referred to this\n\ncourt intended to convey what is presently submitted on behalf of the\r\nMinister. On the contrary, the concluding sentence in para\n22 of\nAbdi\nmakes it clear that the Department’s officials are\r\nobliged to ensure that once there is an indication of an intention to\r\napply\nfor asylum they assist the person concerned to lodge such an\r\napplication at a Refugee Reception Office.\n[78] Regulation 2(2) of\r\nthe Refugee Regulations set out in para 70 above makes it even more\r\nclear that, once there is an indication\nby an individual that he or\r\nshe intends to apply for asylum, that individual is entitled to be\r\nissued with an appropriate permit\nvalid for 14 days within which\r\nthere must be an approach to a Refugee Reception Office to complete\r\nan application for asylum. Read\nwith s 22 of the RA it is clear that\r\nonce such an intention is asserted the individual is entitled to be\r\nfreed subject to the further\nprovisions of the RA.\n[79] The principle of\r\nlegality, an incident of the rule of law, dictates that officialdom\r\nin all its guises must act in accordance\nwith legal prescripts. In\nFedsure\r\nLife Assurance Ltd & others v Greater Johannesburg Transitional\r\nMetropolitan Council & others\n[1998] ZACC 17\n;\n1999 (1) SA\r\n374\n(CC) para 58 the Constitutional Court put it thus:\n‘\nIt\r\nseems central to the conception of our constitutional order that the\r\nLegislature and Executive in every sphere are constrained\nby the\r\nprinciple that they may exercise no power and perform no function\r\nbeyond that conferred upon them by law. At least in this\nsense, then,\r\nthe principle of legality is implied within the terms of the interim\r\nConstitution. Whether the principle of the rule\nof law has greater\r\ncontent than the principle of legality is not necessary for us to\r\ndecide here. We need merely hold that fundamental\nto the interim\r\nConstitution is a principle of legality.’\nIn the present case that\r\nprinciple was breached in more ways than one.\n[80] It follows\r\nineluctably that once an intention to apply for asylum is evinced the\r\nprotective provisions of the Act and the associated\nregulations come\r\ninto play and the asylum seeker is entitled as of right to be set\r\nfree subject to the provisions of the Act.\n[81] This court has a\r\nkeen appreciation of the problems that must inevitably be visited on\r\nthe Department in keeping track of numerous\npersons in the position\r\nof the appellants. As pointed out above, the RA is in keeping with\r\ninternational conventions and international\nbest practice in relation\r\nto refugees. Section 21(2) obliges applicants for asylum to provide\r\nfingerprints and photographs to enable\nthem to be monitored. The\r\npermit in terms of s 22(1) of the RA enabling a sojourn in South\r\nAfrica may be issued subject to\nconditions determined by the Standing\r\nCommittee, which are not in conflict with the Constitution or\r\ninternational law. It does\nnot appear that such conditions have in\r\nfact been determined. Section 38(1)(e) of the RA enables the Minister\r\nto make regulations\nrelating to ‘the conditions of sojourn in\r\nthe Republic of an asylum seeker, while his or her application is\r\nunder consideration’.\nSuch regulations appear not to have been\r\nmade. It is for another arm of Government to prescribe the conditions\r\nunder consideration.\nIn this regard see the comments of this court in\nArse v Minister of Home Affairs\n2010 (7) BCLR 640\n(SCA) para\r\n23. It is not for the judicial arm to do so. The logistical logjam in\r\nthe processing of applications for asylum of people\ndetained at\r\nLindela is in part due to the absence of an RSDO at Lindela. It is a\r\nproblem that is easily resolved but it requires\nan act of will on the\r\npart of the Department.\n[82] Although not\r\nstrictly necessary to consider and decide in the present case, I am\r\nafraid that the factual conclusions sought\nto be drawn by counsel on\r\nbehalf of the Minister and the DG, referred to in para 75 above, are\r\nin themselves unsustainable. The\nappellants explained how they came\r\nto be arrested. They described their difficulty in communicating with\r\nthe authorities. They\nsought assistance from attorneys. The context\r\nis that they were in a foreign country without proper documentation\r\nand at the mercy\nof law enforcement authorities. Be that as it may,\r\nas demonstrated above, the legal-technical approach adopted by the\r\ncourt below\nand counsel for the Minister and the DG before us is\r\nfundamentally flawed.\n[83] One further aspect\r\ncalls for brief attention, namely, the conclusion by the court below\r\nthat there was ‘substantial compliance’\nwith the\r\nrequirement in Regulation 28(4) of the regulations under the IA that\r\nthe notification of intention to apply for extension\nof detention be\r\nserved on the detainee concerned. Once again the principle of\r\nlegality is implicated. Section 28(4)(a) of\nthe regulations\r\nunder the IA reads as follows:\n‘\n(4)\r\nAn immigration officer intending to apply for the extension of the\r\ndetention period in terms of section 34(1)\n(d)\nof\r\nthe Act shall─\n(a) within 20 days\r\nfollowing the arrest of the detainee, serve on that detainee a\r\nnotification of his or her intention on a form\nsubstantially\r\ncorresponding to Form 31 contained in Annexure A; . . .’\n[84]\r\nThe subregulation is couched in peremptory terms. It involves the\r\nliberty of an individual and must be strictly construed.\nIn\nArse\n,\r\nMalan JA in para 10, dealing with the fundamental rights to liberty,\r\nsaid the following:\n‘\nThe\r\nimportance of this right “can never be overstated”.\r\nSection 12(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of South\nAfrica,\r\n1996 guarantees the right to freedom, including the right not to be\r\ndetained without trial. This right belongs to both\ncitizens and\r\nforeigners. The safeguards and limitations contained in\nsection 34(1)\nof the\nImmigration Act justify\nits limitation of the right to freedom\r\nand the right not to be detained without trial. Enactments\r\ninterfering with elementary rights\nshould be construed\r\nrestrictively.’\nThere is no room for the\r\n‘substantial compliance’ approach of the court below. The\r\nextended period of detention as ordered\nby the Magistrate has, in any\r\nevent, already passed. On the construction of the applicable\r\nlegislation set out above the appellants\nwere entitled to the order\r\nmade.\n[85] It is for all the\r\nreasons set out above that the order referred to in the first\r\nparagraph was made.\n_________________\nM S NAVSA\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor Appellants: S\r\nBudlender\nF de Vos\nInstructed by\nLawyers for Human Rights\r\nJohannesburg Law Clinic Johannesburg\nWebbers Bloemfontein\nFor 1\nst\n&\r\n2\nnd\nRespondents: I A M Semenya SC\nN Manaka\nInstructed by\nThe State Attorney\r\nJohannesburg\nThe State Attorney\r\nBloemfontein\nFor 3\nrd\nRespondent: ─\nInstructed by\nEversheds Johannesburg\nAbides by the decision of\r\nthe Court\n1\nSection\r\n\t21(5)\nof the RA provides:\n‘\nThe\r\n\tconfidentiality of asylum applications and the information contained\r\n\ttherein must be ensured at all times.’\n2\nA\r\n\tSemitic language that is the official language of Ethiopia.\n3\nSections\r\n\t8(1)\nand\n8\n(4) of the IA provide for internal review and appeal\r\n\tprocedures in respect of decisions made in terms of the IA.\n4\nReg\r\n\tR 616,\nGG\n27725, 27 June 2005.\n5\nThe\r\n\trelevant sub-regulation was couched in peremptory terms.\n6\nZealand\r\n\tv Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development\n[2008] ZACC 3\n;\n2008 (4) SA\r\n\t458\n(CC) para 25.

    "facts": "Nineteen Ethiopian nationals fled political persecution in Ethiopia in May 2010, travelled through Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique and arrived in Johannesburg in June 2011. They were arrested as illegal foreigners, detained at the Johannesburg police station and then transferred to the Lindela holding facility. The appellants wrote to the Department of Home Affairs demanding an end to deportation proceedings and the opportunity to apply for asylum, but received no response. The High Court dismissed their application for an interdict against deportation and ruled that they had not shown a bona‑fide intention to seek asylum. The appellants appealed, alleging that the Refugees Act and its regulations obligate the State to accept asylum applications and to release them pending a determination.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the appellants, having indicated an intention to apply for asylum, are entitled under the Refugees Act and Regulation 2(2) to be released and issued a temporary asylum‑seeker permit. 2. Whether the High Court erred by pre‑judging the bona‑fide nature of the asylum claim and by ordering continued detention. 3. Whether the Minister and the Director‑General lawfully complied with the procedural requirements of the Immigration Act and the Refugee Regulations in detaining and attempting to deport the appellants.",
    "principles": "The judgment applied the principle of legality, requiring all State action to be strictly within statutory authority. Relevant statutory provisions include s2 and s3 of the Refugees Act (non‑refoulement), s21‑s22 (obligation of Refugee Reception Officers to accept applications and issue 14‑day permits), Regulation 2(2) (persons encountered who indicate an intention to apply for asylum must be given a permit), and the requirement under Regulation 28(4) of the Immigration Act for peremptory written notification before extending detention. International law obligations, notably the 1951 Refugee Convention and the OAU Convention, were also referenced.",
    "application": "The Court held that once the appellants communicated their intention to apply for asylum, they fell within the ambit of Regulation 2(2) and were therefore entitled to a 14‑day permit and to approach a Refugee Reception Office. The High Court’s assessment of the credibility of the asylum claim was improper because the RSDO, not the courts, determines the merits of an asylum application. The Court found that the Department had not complied with the statutory requirement to issue a permit and that the detention order exceeded the limits of Regulation 28(4). Consequently, the High Court’s order was set aside.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The High Court order was set aside and replaced with an order interdicting the Minister and the Director‑General from deporting the appellants until their refugee status is lawfully determined, declaring their detention unlawful, ordering their immediate release, granting them a 14‑day period to approach a Refugee Reception Office, directing the respondents to accept their asylum applications and issue temporary asylum‑seeker permits, and awarding costs to the appellants."
