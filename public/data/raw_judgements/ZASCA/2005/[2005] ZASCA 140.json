In terms of\nthe contract the defendant undertook to cover the plaintiffâs\nproperty, described as Erf 909, Onderlingstraat, Virginia, (âthe\npropertyâ), against loss or damage by fire. The clause reads:\nâ\nIf any claim under this policy be in any respect\nfraudulent, or if any fraudulent means or devices be used by the\ninsured or anyone\nacting on his behalf or with his knowledge or\nconsent to obtain any benefit under this policy, or if any event be\noccasioned by the\nwilful act or with the connivance of the insured,\nthe benefit afforded under this policy in respect of such claim shall\nbe forfeited.â\n[English version]\n[2]\tIn October 2002 the plaintiffâs property was extensively\ndamaged by a fire and the damage was assessed at R164 149,00. The\nplaintiff claimed indemnification from Santam under the policy but\nliability was repudiated on the ground that the plaintiff had\nattempted to obtain a benefit under the policy by fraudulent means.\n[3]\tThe plaintiff instituted action in the High Court at Bloemfontein\nclaiming indemnification under the policy but this also failed.\nCillie J, before whom the matter served, upheld Santamâs defence\nbased on the exclusion clause, dismissed the claim with costs\nand\ngranted leave to appeal to this court.\n[4]\tThe attempted fraud relied on by Santam for its invocation of the\nexclusion clause emerged from the evidence of an assessor,\nMr AndrÃ©\nCarstens, who was engaged by the company to assess the damage caused\nby the fire. Carstens testified that the plaintiff\nhad approached him\non two occasions with the request that he inflate the damage to the\nproperty. On the first occasion the plaintiff\noffered Carstens R50\n000 if he assessed the damage at R500 000 and on the second occasion\nR10 000 if he assessed the damage at R165\n000. On both occasions he\nrefused. Subsequently Carstens assessed the damage at R164 149,00,\nwhich was the correct assessment of\nthe damage. In due course\nCarstens submitted to Santam his assessment note which included a\nreport concerning the two attempts by\nthe plaintiff to improperly\ninfluence him in his assessment of the damage. The company duly\nrepudiated the claim, citing the exclusion\nclause in its letter of\nrepudiation sent to the plaintiff.\n[5]\tOn appeal Carstensâ evidence concerning the plaintiffâs\nfraudulent attempts to obtain a benefit under the policy was not\nchallenged but his counsel argued that, since attempts were made\nbefore the claim was lodged, the plaintiffâs conduct was not\ncovered\nby the exclusion clause. For the clause to apply, argued\ncounsel, the claim had first to have been lodged (âingedienâ).\n[6]\tBefore dealing with the plaintiffâs argument it would be as\nwell to restate the main principles governing the interpretation\nof a\npolicy of insurance, and to do so with reference to the decision in\nFedgen Insurance Ltd v Leyds\n1\n,\nwhere it was said:\nâ\nThe ordinary rules relating to the interpretation of\ncontracts must be applied in construing a policy of insurance. A\ncourt must therefore\nendeavour to ascertain the intention of the\nparties. Such intention is, in the first instance, to be gathered\nfrom the language used\nwhich, if clear, must be given effect to. This\ninvolves giving the words used their plain, ordinary and popular\nmeaning unless the\ncontext indicates otherwise (\nScottish\nUnion & National Insurance Co Ltd v Native Recruiting Corporation\nLtd\n1934 AD 458\nat 464-5). Any provision\nwhich purports to place a limitation upon a clearly expressed\nobligation to indemnify must be restrictively\ninterpreted (\nAuto\nProtection Insurance Co Ltd v Hanmer-Strudwick\n1964\n(1) SA 349\n(A) at 354C-D); for it is the insurerâs duty to make\nclear what particular risks it wishes to exclude (\nFrench\nHairdressing Saloons Ltd v National Employers Mutual General\nInsurance Association Ltd\n1931 AD 60\nat 65;\nAuto Protection Insurance Co Ltd v\nHanmer-Strudwick\n(\nsupra\nat 354D-E)). A policy normally evidences the contract and an\ninsuredâs obligation, and the extent to which an insurerâs\nliability\nis limited, must be plainly spelt out. In the event of a\nreal ambiguity the\ncontra proferentem\nrule,\nwhich requires a written document to be construed against the person\nwho drew it up, would operate against Fedgen as drafter\nof the policy\n(\nKliptown Clothing Industries (Pty) Ltd v\nMarine and Trade Insurance Co of SA Ltd\n1961\n(1) SA 103\n(A) at 108C).â\n(See also\nVan Zyl NO v Kiln Non-Marine Syndicate No 510 of Lloyds\nof London\n2\n).\n[7]\tThe language of the clause is clear and unambiguous. There is\ntherefore no reason not to give the words their ordinary meaning.\nGiving the clause its ordinary meaning, three situations are in my\nview covered by it. The first deals with where a claim under the\npolicy is in any respect fraudulent; the second is concerned with\nwhere fraudulent means or devices are used by the insured to obtain\nany benefit under the policy; the third covers a situation where any\nevent is occasioned by the wilful act or with the connivance\nof the\ninsured. In all these situations the benefit afforded under the\npolicy is to be forfeited.\n[8]\tIt is therefore clear that the argument that the exclusion clause\ncannot be invoked where fraud is committed before the claim\nis\nlodged, loses sight of the fact that the clause deals with three\ndifferent situations. The first situation does indeed deal with\nthe\ncase where a fraudulent claim has been lodged. But the second,\nrelating to the prohibition of the use of fraudulent means or\ndevices\nto obtain any benefit under the policy, presupposes that a claim has\nnot been submitted (âingedienâ). The second situation\ncannot\nrefer to a fraudulent claim that has already been lodged as this is\ncovered by the first situation contemplated in the clause\nand would\ntherefore render the second one tautologous. Accordingly, in their\ncontext the words âto obtainâ mean âin order to\nobtainâ. The\nthird situation referred to in the clause deals with a fraudulent\nevent that has been caused by the wilful act of\nthe insured and has\nno application in the present matter. During argument counsel was\nunable to give examples of when in the absence\nof a claim being\nlodged the second situation referred to in the clause (dealing with\nthe attempted fraudulent means) would apply,\nif it were not to cover\na situation such as the present. Even if one, therefore, gives the\nclause an interpretation most favourable\nto the plaintiff, the\ninterpretation contended for on the plaintiffâs behalf cannot be\nsustained and must accordingly be rejected.\n[9]\tCounselâs second argument, which was related to the first, was\nthat since Carstens had not acceded to the request to inflate\nthe\ndamage and Santam had not paid or would in any event not have paid\nmore than the true value of the damage, the plaintiff had\nnot\nobtained any benefit under the policy. Consequently, so the argument\nwent, the exclusion clause had not been breached. For this\nargument,\ncounsel relied on\nStrydom v Certain Underwriting Members\n3\n,\nwhere Labe J was called upon to interpret and apply an identically\nworded clause.\n4\nIn that case the insured had knowingly made a fraudulent statement\naimed at showing that he had not been negligent in relation to\nthe\nmotor collision which had resulted in damage to his car. The\nfraudulent statement was, however, of no consequence, in that it\ndid\nnot affect the insurerâs position to its prejudice and was\ntherefore not material. It was not necessary for the insured to\nhave\nmade a fraudulent statement in the first place because he was covered\nagainst his own negligence.\n[10]\tThe position is, however, different in this case. The exclusion\nclause covers the very situation which occurred here, namely\nuse by\nthe plaintiff of fraudulent means or devices in order to obtain an\nundue benefit under the policy. None of the contentions\nraised have\nany merit and the appeal must therefore fail.\n[11]\tI turn briefly to the question of costs. Santam asked for costs\nof two counsel. On appeal it was represented by a silk and a\njunior\nwho were not called upon to argue. The plaintiff was, on the other\nhand, represented by junior counsel. In my view the matter\nis simple\nand straightforward even if it does involve an interpretation of a\npolicy clause in widespread use. I do not think this\ncase warranted\nthe briefing of two counsel and an order allowing costs of two\ncounsel would therefore not be justified.\n[12]\tIn the result the appeal is dismissed with costs.\n_\n__________________\nKK MTHIYANE\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCONCUR:\nHOWIE P\nSCOTT JA\nNUGENT JA\nMLAMBO JA\n1\n1995 (3) SA 33\n(A) at 38B-E.\n2\n2003 (2) SA 440\n(SCA) at para 6.\n3\n2000 (2) SA 482\n(W).\n4\nOp cit\nat 484F.",

    "facts": "The appellant and respondent entered into an insurance policy on 1 June 2002 covering the appellant's property against fire. In October 2002 the property was damaged by fire, with loss assessed at R164,149. The appellant sought indemnity, but the insurer repudiated the claim, alleging the appellant had attempted to fraudulently inflate the damage assessment. An assessor, Mr André Carstens, testified that the appellant offered him R50,000 to assess the damage at R500,000 and later R10,000 for an assessment of R165,000; Carstens refused both offers and assessed the damage correctly at R164,149.",
    "issues": "The central issue was whether the insurer's exclusion clause, which forfeit benefits for fraudulent claims or the use of fraudulent means to obtain a benefit, applied to fraudulent conduct that occurred before the claim was formally lodged. A subsidiary issue concerned whether the appellant had actually obtained any benefit from the alleged fraud, and thus whether the clause was triggered.",
    "principles": "The court applied standard rules of contractual interpretation to insurance policies, emphasizing the need to give plain ordinary meaning to words unless context dictates otherwise. It referenced Fedgen Insurance Ltd v Leyds for the principle that limitations on indemnity must be interpreted restrictively and, where ambiguity exists, the contra proferentem rule applies. The court also considered Strydom v Certain Underwriting Members concerning the materiality of fraudulent statements, and reiterated that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous.",
    "application": "The court held that the exclusion clause was clear and covered three situations, including the use of fraudulent means to obtain a benefit before a claim is lodged. The appellant's attempts to induce the assessor to over‑state the loss fell squarely within the second situation of the clause. The court rejected the argument that no benefit was obtained, noting that the clause is triggered by the fraudulent attempt to obtain an undue benefit, regardless of whether the benefit ultimately materialised. Consequently, the appellant's contentions were dismissed.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was dismissed. The appellant was ordered to pay costs, with the court finding that an order for costs of two counsel was unjustified. No further relief was granted to the appellant."
