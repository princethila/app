This involves, in the first\nplace, research being carried out by scientists in the Department of\nEnvironmental Affairs and Tourism (‘the Department’)\nand other\nresearch organisations. The resource forming the subject matter of each of the\n22 commercial fishing sectors in the industry\nis monitored on a regular basis.\nAt the opening of each fishing season an estimate is made of the stock size, or\n‘biomass’,\ntogether with a recommendation to the Minister as to the\n‘Total Allowable Catch’ (‘TAC’) which the resource\ncan\nsustain over the ensuing period. Based on the quantum so determined fishing\nrights in respect of each sector are then awarded\nto successful applicants.\nGiven the large number of applicants in respect of each sector, the limit\nimposed by the predetermined\nTAC and the need to allocate fishing rights in\nquantities that are commercially viable, it is inevitable that many applicants\nare\ndisappointed. The unfortunate consequence has been a flood of review\napplications in the past, which the Department complains has\nhad the effect of\ndisrupting  commercial fishing in some sectors. To add to the difficulties\nassociated with the allocation of fishing\nrights, there has also been the need,\nimposed by the Act, to take steps to transform the industry which until recent\ntimes was dominated\nby companies that historically were established, owned and\nmanaged by white people. Section 18(5) of the Act provides –\n‘In\ngranting any right referred to in subsection (1), the Minister shall, in order\nto achieve the objectives contemplated in\nsection 2, have particular regard to\nthe need to permit new entrants, particularly those from historically\ndisadvantaged sectors\nof society.’\nThe objectives identified in s 2\ninclude –\n‘(j)\tthe need to restructure the fishing industry to\naddress historical \timbalances  and  to achieve equity within all  branches\nof\nthe \tfishing  industry.’\n[2]\tThe present appeal concerns the allocation\nof commercial fishing rights in the hake longline sector for the 2002 - 2005\nfishing\nseason. Four of the 22 fishing sectors relate to hake, one of which is\nthe longline sector. Because of the large number of applications\nthat were\nanticipated in the 22 sectors – in the event there were over 5000 –\nthe Minister, acting in terms of s 79 of\nthe Act, delegated his power to grant\nfishing rights in some of the sectors to Dr Mayekiso, the Chief Director, and in\nothers, including\nthe hake longline sector, to Mr Horst Kleinschmidt, the Deputy\nDirector General (‘the DDG’) who is the second appellant.\nThe TAC in\nthe hake longline sector was determined at 10 840 tons. A little more than 9 per\ncent, ie 1015 tons, was set aside for\nappeals leaving 9825 tons for immediate\nallocation to successful applicants. There were 333 applicants; 115 were\nsuccessful. Of the\nlatter, 40 were so-called ‘2001 rights holders’.\nThe other 75 were so-called ‘potential new entrants’. (The\ndistinction is the subject matter of one of the principal issues in the appeal.)\nSome 204 of the disappointed applicants lodged an\nappeal to the Minister in\nterms of s 80 of the Act. Three were 2001 rights holders. The remainder were new\nentrants. Ultimately some\n26 were successful. These included the three 2001\nrights holders. The respondent was not one of the successful applicants. Its\napplication\nin terms of s 18(1) failed, as did its appeal to the\nMinister.\n[3]\tThe respondent in due course instituted motion proceedings in\nthe High Court, Cape Town, in which it sought orders reviewing and\nsetting aside\nall of the allocations of the DDG and the Minister’s decisions on appeal\nin the hake longline sector. It also\nsought an order directing the appellants to\nre-allocate the commercial fishing rights in the sector for the 2002 - 2005 \nseason before\na date to be determined. The appellants were cited as the first\nand second respondents and the 141 successful applicants were cited\nas the\nremaining respondents. In the course of the hearing in the court\na quo\nthe respondent withdrew its application in so far as it concerned the\nallocations made to the successful applicants but persisted\nin its application\nagainst the Minister and the DDG, contending that their decisions were fatally\nflawed and reviewable. In the result,\nthe court\na quo\nset aside the\ndecision of the DDG not to grant commercial fishing rights in the hake longline\nsector to the respondent. It made no\norder regarding the Minister’s\ndecision on appeal, holding that it was unnecessary to do so. It also found it\nunnecessary in\nthe circumstances to consider the respondent’s application\nto have certain matters referred for oral evidence in terms of Uniform\nRule\n6(5)(\ng\n). In this court we were informed by counsel that a certain\nquantity of the TAC had been held back for contingencies and that for\nthis\nreason it was unnecessary for the court\na quo\nto make an order regarding\nthe re-allocation of hake longline fishing rights. It simply referred the\nrespondent’s application\nback to the DDG for\nreconsideration.\n[4]\tBefore turning to the allocations in respect of the 2002\n- 2005 season, it is necessary by way of background to refer briefly\nto certain\nearlier events. Until 2002 commercial fishing rights were granted annually. With\neffect from that year a policy was adopted\nof allocating what were styled\n‘medium-term fishing rights’ which were for a period not exceeding\nfour years. The rationale\nwas to enhance the opportunity for investment and to\npromote stability. The previous allocations in the hake longline sector were\nfor\nthe 2000 fishing season. This was the first occasion on which the respondent had\napplied for fishing rights in the sector. There\nwere initially 43 successful\napplicants. The respondent and 130 others whose applications had failed\nthereupon successfully appealed\nin terms of s 80 to the DDG, acting on delegated\nauthority. Their success, which was published on 19 September 2000, was\nshort-lived.\nOn 3 November and 6 November 2000 separate review applications were\nlaunched in the Cape Town High Court resulting in the allocations\non appeal\nbeing set aside on 20 November 2000. On the same day an applicant in one of the\nreview applications sought an order directing\nthe State respondents to effect a\nre-allocation in terms of the appeal process within three weeks. The application\nwas opposed by\nthe Department. The DDG explained in an answering affidavit that\nit was impossible to complete the task within three weeks or to\nsay when it\ncould be completed. However, he gave the undertaking that the respondents would\nendeavour ‘to deal with the appeals\nas expeditiously as possible’.\nWhat followed was anything but expeditious. The DDG himself could not reconsider\nthe appeals.\nThis was because various allegations of impropriety had been made\nagainst him in the review proceedings. It was decided to appoint\na regional\nmagistrate from Pretoria to deal with the appeals. Presumably this was to place\nthe independence of the decision-maker\nbeyond doubt. But the magistrate first\nhad to be seconded to the Department so that the requisite powers could be\ndelegated to him.\nApparently this all took time. Eventually he was appropriately\nbriefed. After several weeks he produced a report containing recommendations\nto\nthe Minister. The report was evidently flawed. On 29 May 2001 it was rejected by\nthe Minister on grounds that were not impugned.\nBy this time the 2000 season had\nlong since expired, as had much of the 2001 season. The allocation process for\nthe 2002 - 2005 season\nwas also imminent and given the time it would take to go\nthrough the whole appeal process yet again, it seems that the matter of\nthe\nappeal was simply abandoned.\n[5]\tIn the meantime, no applications for\ncommercial fishing rights in the sector had been called for in respect of the\n2001 fishing\nseason. Instead the Minister, acting in terms of s\n18(6A)(\na\n), extended the rights of the 43 successful applicants to include\nthe 2001 season. These are the applicants who were referred to by\nthe parties as\n‘the 2001 rights holders’.\n[6]\tFinally, it is necessary to\nmention that the respondent is the successor to Elandia Visserye BK which was\nformed in 1989 to operate\na business founded by two brothers by the name of Van\nder Westhuizen in 1951. The business involved the catching and processing of\nWest Coast rock lobster. More recently and pursuant to what was called a\n‘transformation scheme’, the respondent and\na sister company were\nestablished with a somewhat complicated share structure. It is enough to say\nthat the overall effect of the\nscheme was to confer on an employees’ trust\na 60 per cent interest in the existing or future fishing rights of the\nenterprise,\nbut a limited interest of something in the region of six per cent in\nthe hard assets of the enterprise, these being owned by the\nsister company.\nThere were also provisions in the trust deed which in practice made it difficult\nfor employees to receive the benefits\nfrom the trust on leaving from their\nemployment.\n[7]\tAgainst this background I come to the process by which\ncommercial fishing rights were allocated for the 2002 - 2005 fishing season.\nIn\nterms of s 18(1) of the Act an application for any right referred to in s 18(1)\nis to be submitted to the Minister in a manner\ndetermined by him or her. This\nthe Minister did by way of a General Notice (1771 of 2001) published in the\nGovernment Gazette of\n27 July 2001. It contained, first, an invitation to the\npublic to apply for fishing rights in all 22 sectors for the 2002 - 2005\nseason;\nsecond, a specimen application form including instructions for the completion of\nthe form; and third, policy guidelines aimed\nat assisting prospective applicants\nin the preparation of their application (‘the guidelines’). The\nlatter document is\nimportant. A brief summary is necessary. In the introduction\nthe reader is informed\ninter alia\nthat a verification unit had been\nappointed to verify information contained in the applications and that a panel\nof specialists would\nbe appointed to assist in the assessment and allocation\nprocess. Under the heading ‘Evaluation of Applications’ it is\nsaid\nthat applications will be evaluated in accordance with the objectives and\nprinciples set out in s 2 of the Act ‘and with\nregard to the policy\nguidelines set out below’. The next sentence reads –\n‘No\nprecedence, ranking or weighting is implied by the order or content of the\npolicy guidelines.’\nThere was some debate in this court as to its\nmeaning. In my view what was intended was that nothing was to be made of the\norder in\nwhich the paragraphs following (including their contents) were listed.\nFour numbered paragraphs follow, each with a heading. The\nheadings read\n–\n‘1.\tBusiness plan, fishing plan or operational and investment\nstrategy\n2.\tEquity, transformation, restructuring and empowerment\n3.\tImpact on the resources, environment and the fishing \tindustry\n4.\tNew\nEntrants’.\nIn view of some of the grounds of attack directed at the\nDDG’s decision, it is necessary to quote certain relevant passages.\nIn\nparagraph 1 the following is said:\n‘Cognisance has been taken of the\nfact that substantial investments have been made by many of the current rights\nholders. This\nfactor, together with the need to create an environment that will\npromote further long-term investment in human and material resources\nare\nimportant considerations. Historical involvements, proof of investment and past\nperformance are therefore important factors.’\nParagraph 2\ncommences:\n‘The transformation of South Africa from an unequal society\nrooted in discrimination and disparity to a constitutional \tdemocracy\nfounded\nupon freedom, dignity and equality poses particularly profound challenges for\nthe fishing industry. It is here that there\nare acute imbalances in \tpersonal\nwealth, infrastructure and access to financial and other resources. While it is\nacknowledged that\ntransformation or restructuring of the fishing industry cannot\nbe achieved \tovernight, it nevertheless is a primary objective to\nbuild a\nfishing industry that in its ownership and management, broadly reflects the\ndemographics of South Africa today.’\nIn paragraph 3 the hake longline\nand handline sectors are identified as being particularly suitable for the\npromotion of historically\ndisadvantaged individuals, presumably because these\nsectors are less capital intensive than the others. In paragraph 4 the following\nis said:\n‘Regard will be given to accommodating new entrants,\nparticularly those from historically disadvantaged \tcommunities, in order\nto\nmeet the requirement of restructuring  the  fishing industry to  address \nhistorical   imbalances   and\t  to achieve equity within\nall branches of the\n\tfishing industry.’\nI shall have more to say about the guidelines\nlater. It is enough at this stage to observe that it would have been clear to\nprospective\napplicants that in allocating fishing rights regard would be had\ninter alia\nto two conflicting considerations; the one being the need to\naccommodate new entrants, particularly those from historically disadvantaged\ncommunities, the other being the need to recognise and take cognisance of the\ninvestments and past performances of current rights\nholders.\n[8]\tBoth a\nverification unit and an advisory committee were established to assist the\ndecision-maker, in this case the DDG, in processing\nthe applications (which had\nto be submitted by 13 September 2001). The function of the verification unit was\nessentially to scrutinize\neach application to determine whether it was properly\nlodged and complied with the formal requirements. The advisory committee\ncomprised\npersons with legal, accounting and financial expertise. Its function\nwas to assist the decision-maker in evaluating the applications.\nIn the\ninterests of independence the members of both the verification unit and the\nadvisory committee were appointed by what was\ndescribed as ‘a public\ntender process’.\n[9]\tThe applications were divided into two groups:\n2001 rights holders and potential new entrants. Each group was evaluated in the\nfirst instance by the advisory committee in accordance with a detailed set of\nwritten instructions and guidelines devised or approved\nby the DDG. This\ninvolved the allocation of points determined by a closely circumscribed method\nfor each of a number of criteria.\nThe total number of points that could be\nawarded for each criterion was determined by the DDG. In the case of the 2001\nrights holders\n(in the hake longline sector) the criteria\nwere:\n‘1.\tInvolvement and investment in the industry, including\n\tbusiness \tplan, fishing plan or operational and investment strategy\n2.\tPast\nperformance\n3.\tStrategies in respect of by-catch and offal utilisation\n4.\tCompliance\n5.\tTransformation\n6.\tPaper quotas’.\n(The\nreference to paper quotas is a reference to applications by persons intending to\nacquire rights in order to sell or transfer\nthem. This criterion involved the\naward of a negative mark.) The          criteria in the case of the new entrants\nwere:\n‘(1)   \tDegree of knowledge, involvement and commitment to invest\nin the \tindustry, including business plan, fishing plan or\noperational and\n\tinvestment strategy\n(2)\tHDP [historically disadvantaged person] status\n(3)\tStrategies for bycatch and offal utilisation\n(4)\tBusiness acumen,\nfinancial capacity and capacity to catch, process \tand market the resource\n(5)\tCompliance if applicable\n(6)\tPaper quotas’.\nMr Papier, the\nchairman of the advisory committee, explained the procedure adopted. Each\napplication was independently examined by\ntwo members of the committee to\nachieve consistency. In many cases the applications would be flagged with\nannotated notes in order\nto draw some specific aspect to the attention of the\nDDG.  Significantly, the written instructions emphasised that the criteria and\nthe weighting (the scoring) were ultimately no more than guides in the\nassessment of the applications ‘and if [the criteria\nand weighting] do not\napply appropriately, the committee member must record the difficulty on the\ntemplate so that it can be brought\nto the attention of the\ndecision-maker’. The DDG, moreover, spent many hours every day at the\noffices where the advisory committee\nworked in order to satisfy himself that the\nevaluations were being carried out in accordance with his\ninstructions.\n[10]\tOn these occasions and during the initial briefings the\nmatters that were required to be brought to his attention were identified\nand\ndiscussed at length.  In his answering affidavit the DDG stressed that the\nadvisory committee was well aware of the limits within\nwhich it was required to\noperate, particularly as those issues had been raised and discussed many times\nby December 2001 when the\nhake longline sector applications came to be\nconsidered. The Committee was unaware of what the threshold  mark for acceptance\nwould\nbe.\n[11]\tOnce an application had been assessed, the information\nrecorded on what in effect was a score-sheet was transferred to one of\ntwo sets\nof spreadsheets, there being one set for each group. The spreadsheets had\nhorizontal columns – one for each application\n– which were divided\ninto blocks in which the scores for each particular criterion were entered\ntogether with, in some instances,\na brief comment. At the end of each horizontal\ncolumn there were two blocks to be filled in by the decision-maker (the DDG in\nthe\ncase of the hake longline sector) under the headings –\n‘Does\nthe delegated authority grant the applicants rights in terms of s 18 of the\nAct?\nYes/No’\nand\n‘Comments of the delegated\nauthority’.\n[12]\tOnce the applications had been evaluated by the\nadvisory committee they were delivered per sector to the DDG. They were\naccompanied\nby the score-sheets and the consolidated spreadsheets reflecting the\ninformation on the former as well as checklists. As previously\nindicated, many\nof the applications were marked and flagged to draw his attention to specific\naspects. The DDG explained that in\neach case he began by studying the\nconsolidated spreadsheet. Where an aspect had been identified for his attention\nhe considered\nthe issue regardless of the score. He also randomly checked the\napplications. In many instances the applications were manifestly\ngood or\nmanifestly poor. He tended to spend less time on these and by the very nature of\nthe exercise devoted most of his time and\nattention to the applications that\nfell in the middle group, ie those that were within a point or two on either\nside of success or\nfailure. He said that in some cases he agreed with the\nassessments of the advisory committee and in others not. He denied that there\nwas a rigid and inflexible adherence to the scoring system. Where appropriate he\nmade adjustments to accommodate particular cases.\nHe insisted that in the final\nanalysis the decision whether or not to grant fishing rights in the case of each\nand every applicant\nwas his. Once having taken the decision he recorded it on\nthe consolidated spreadsheet. Where he considered it appropriate he made\ncomments in the space provided.\n[13]\tThe points system for potential new\nentrants differed in various respects from that for 2001 rights holders. Of\nsignificance\nis that in the case of the former, 50 per cent of the points that\ncould be scored were allocated to transformation and employment\nequity criteria,\nwhereas in the case of the latter only 36 per cent of the points that could be\nscored were allocated to those criteria.\nThe effect of this weighting was that\nan applicant who did not score particularly well in the transformation and\nemployment equity\ncriteria had a far better prospect of being granted fishing\nrights if placed in the 2001 rights holders category than if placed in\nthe new\nentrants category.\n[14]\tIt was this differentiation in scoring that\nultimately formed the basis of the respondent’s primary attack on the\nDDG’s\ndecision not to grant it fishing rights in the hake longline sector.\nIt contended that by reason of the Minister’s failure\nto dispose of the\nappeals in the allocation of fishing rights in that sector for the 2000 season\nand the extension of the rights\nof those who were successful to the 2001 season,\nthe streaming of applicants into 2001 rights holders                           \n\nand new entrants for the 2002 - 2005 season was both unreasonable within the\nmeaning of s 6(2)(\nh\n)  of  the  Promotion of\nAdministrative Justice\nAct 3 of 2000 (‘PAJA’) and procedurally unfair within the meaning of\ns 6(2)(\nc\n) of that Act. I quote s 6(2) in its entirety:\n‘6(2)\tA\ncourt or tribunal has the power to judicially review an administrative action if\n–\n(\na\n)    the administrator who took it –\n(i)\twas not authorised to do so by the empowering provision;\n(ii)\tacted under a delegation of power which was not authorised by\n\t\tthe empowering provision; or\n(iii)\twas biased or reasonably suspected of bias;\n(\nb\n)\ta mandatory and material procedure or condition prescribed by an\n\tempowering provision was not complied with;\n(\nc\n)\tthe action was procedurally unfair;\n(\nd\n)\tthe action was materially influenced by an error of law;\n(\ne\n)\tthe action was taken –\n(i)\tfor a reason not authorised by the empowering provision;\n(ii)\tfor an ulterior purpose or motive;\n(iii)\tbecause irrelevant considerations were taken into account or\n\t\trelevant considerations were not considered;\n(iv)\tbecause of the unauthorised or unwarranted dictates of another\n\t\tperson or body;\n(v)\tin bad faith; or\n(vi)\tarbitrarily or capriciously;\n(\nf\n)\tthe action itself –\n(i)\tcontravenes a law or is not authorised by the empowering \t\t\tprovision;\nor\n(ii)\tis not rationally connected to –\n(aa)\nthe purpose for which it was\ntaken;\n(\nbb\n)\tthe purpose of the empowering provision;\n(\ncc\n)\tthe information before the administrator;\nor\n(dd)\nthe\nreasons given for it by the\nadministrator;\n(\ng\n)\tthe action concerned\nconsists of a failure to take a decision;\n(\nh\n)\tthe exercise of the\npower or the performance of the function authorised \tby the empowering\nprovision, in pursuance of which the\nadministrative \taction was purportedly\ntaken,  is so unreasonable that no reasonable \tperson could have so exercised\nthe power or\nperformed the function; \tor\n(\ni\n)\tthe action is otherwise\nunconstitutional or unlawful.’\n[15]\tThe object of streaming the applications into two groups and affording\ngreater weight to transformation in the case of new entrants\nwas to give effect\nto the statutory requirements referred to in paragraph [1] above. Possibly the\nobjectives of the Act could have\nbeen achieved by adopting some other and\nnotionally better method than streaming. But that is not the test. The inquiry\nis whether\nthe process of streaming fell foul of one or more of the grounds of\nreview set out in s 6(2) of PAJA. The grounds upon which reliance\nappears to\nhave been placed were twofold; unreasonableness within the meaning of s\n6(2)(\nh\n) in view of the circumstances relating to the 2000 appeals\n(\ncf\nBato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental\nAffairs\n[2004] ZACC 15\n;\n2004 (4) SA 490\n(CC) para 45), and procedural unfairness\nwithin the meaning of s 6(2)(\nc\n). In my view, neither was established. The\nrationale underlying the streaming and the weighting in favour of transformation\nin the\ncase of new entrants was obviously to accommodate the two conflicting\nconsiderations referred to in the guidelines, namely the need\nto take cognisance\nof past investment and performance in the industry on the one hand and the need\nto admit new entrants, particularly\nthose from previously disadvantaged\ncommunities, on the other. The decision to stream with a bias in favour of\ntransformation criteria\nin the case of new entrants would seem in the\ncircumstances to be both a logical and fair way of going about an undeniably\ndifficult\ntask. However, the gravamen of the respondent’s complaint was\nthat had the appeal process in respect of the 2000 fishing season\nnot been\nabandoned in all probability the respondent would have been a 2001 rights holder\nand in that event its application in the\n2002 - 2005 season would have\nsucceeded. It was accordingly argued that given what had gone before, provision\nshould have been made\nfor a third group comprising the ‘formerly\nsuccessful appellants’ in the 2000 allocations. But the simple answer is\nthat\nthere would be no rational basis for making the distinction contended for.\nIn other words, there would be no proper basis for affording\nsome preference or\nadvantage to applicants who had not previously participated in the sector but\nwho happened to have been the victims\nof some prior administrative blunder.\n(\nCf\nLogbro Properties CC v Bedderson NO\n2003 (2) SA 460\n(SCA)\nparas 16 -22.) The position would, of course, have been different if as a result\nof the respondent’s success on appeal\nin 2000, although shortlived, it had\nengaged in hake longline fishing and had made investments in relation to that\nsector. In that\nevent there would have been good reason for distinguishing it\nfrom other new entrants. But that was not the case. Whatever the reason,\nthe\nrespondent was a new entrant like the other new entrants and it was not\nunreasonably treated as such.\n[16]\tA further argument advanced on behalf of the respondent was that the\neffect of streaming was, as counsel put it, to ‘straitjacket’\nthe\nDDG’s discretion. In other words, it presupposed, said counsel, that every\napplication would fall within one or other of\nthe two groups and that this would\nnot necessarily have been appropriate. But, as I have sought to show, the system\nwas sufficiently\nflexible to accommodate such a situation. Whenever the criteria\nand weighting in any particular case was inappropriate it was brought\nto the\nattention of the decision-maker who regarded himself as not bound by the scoring\nin terms of the prescribed method. So, for\nexample, had the respondent actually\nengaged in hake longline fishing prior to the allocation in its favour being set\naside on review,\ndue weight would have been afforded to this fact in the\ndetermination of its application. But as I have said, nothing like this was\nshown to have occurred and no facts were advanced to justify the respondent\nbeing treated as anything other than a new entrant.\n[17]\tA related contention, and one that found favour with the court\na\nquo\n, was that the adoption of a set of criteria for each group and a system\nof scoring for the assessment of the criteria had the effect\nof precluding the\ndecision-maker from properly exercising his discretion. Counsel for the\nrespondent relied in this regard on s 6(2)(\nc\n), (\nd\n) and (\nf\n)\nof PAJA and a number of decisions in support of the proposition that while a\nfunctionary may have regard for guidance to a predetermined\nrule of which it\napproves, it would not be exercising  its discretion if it treated the rule as a\nhard and fast one to be applied\nas a matter of course in every case. (See\nJohannesburg Town Council v Norman Anstey & Co\n1928 AD 335\nat 340;\nComputer Investors Group Inc v Minister of Finance\n1979 (1) SA 879\n(T) at\n898D-E;\nHofmeyr v Minister of Justice\n1992 (3) 108 (C) at 117F-H.) The\nposition must necessarily be somewhat different where the decision-maker is\nfaced with a large volume\nof competing applications and the need for consistency\nbecomes an imperative requirement for fairness. The\nBato Star Fishing\ncase,\nsupra\n, was concerned with the same allocation process as the\npresent, but in relation to the quantum of the quotas granted in the hake\ndeep\nsea trawling sector. After quoting a passage in the judgment of Human J in\nComputer Investors Group v Minister of Finance, supra,\nat 898C-E in which\nthe learned judge reformulated the proposition referred to above in relation to\nthe adherence to hard and fast\nrules, O’ Regan J said the following (at\npara 57):\n‘In circumstances such as these, moreover, where the decision-maker is\nseeking to evaluate a large number of applications against\nsimilar criteria, the\ndictum\nin the\nComputer Investors Group\ncase [at 898C-E] is not\nrelevant. In cases such as the present, it will be permissible, and indeed will\noften be desirable, for administrative\ndecision-makers to adopt and apply\ngeneral criteria evenly to each application in order to ensure that the decision\nsubsequently\nmade is fair and consistent.’\nAs previously indicated, a feature of the method adopted was in any event the\nprovision for adjustment in circumstances where the\ncriteria and weighting were\nfor any reason inappropriate. It follows that in my view the adoption of a set\nof criteria and a system\nof scoring for their assessment cannot be faulted.  On\nthe contrary, the method strikes me as one which was objective, rational and\npractical in the circumstances.\n[18]\tA further point made by the respondent was that the applicants for\nfishing rights ought to have been told in advance of the procedure\nto be adopted\ninvolving as it did the streaming of the applications into two groups and the\nuse of a scoring system applied to predetermined\ncriteria. It was argued that\nthe failure on the part of the DDG properly to advise applicants rendered the\nallocation process procedurally\nunfair. Section 3(2)(\na\n) of PAJA expressly\nprovides that what is procedurally fair depends on the circumstances of each\ncase. In the present case the applicants\nfor fishing rights were required to\ncomplete a detailed application form which indicated precisely what information\nwas required.\nIt was accompanied by instructions on how to complete the form and\nguidelines setting out in broad terms the considerations which\nthe\ndecision-maker regarded as material for the purpose of making the allocations.\nAn applicant would therefore have been fully aware\nof the information that was\nrequired and on which the allocations were to be made. In these circumstances,\nthe decision-maker, in\nmy view, was not required to explain in advance exactly\nhow the applications would be processed. As Baxter\nAdministrative Law\nat\n548 puts it: ‘The administration cannot be expected to share with the\nindividual every phase of its final decision-making\nprocess.’ This point,\ntoo, must fail.\n[19]\tFinally, as far as the decision in terms of s 18(1) of the Act is\nconcerned, counsel for the respondent argued that the procedure\nadopted involved\nan impermissible sub-delegation of the DDG’s discretion to the advisory\ncommittee. This was the second of\nthe two grounds relied upon by the court\na\nquo to set aside the DDG’s decision. The DDG was himself a delegate of\nthe Minister in terms of s 79(1)(\na\n) of the Act. Section 79(2) reads:\n‘The Director-General may delegate any power conferred upon him or her\nin terms of this Act to an officer in the Department\nupon the conditions that he\nor she deems fit.’\nIt was accordingly common cause that the Act did not allow the DDG to\nsub-delegate his discretionary powers to the advisory committee\nwhich, it will\nbe recalled, comprised persons from outside the department. Counsel for the\nrespondent referred to the\nmodus operandi\nof the advisory committee and\npointed out that the scoring in the case of at least some of the pre-determined\ncriteria involved value\njudgments based on facts of which the DDG would have\nbeen unaware unless he read the application itself. This, he said, amounted\nto\nmore than giving advice on facts placed before the DDG; it amounted to the\nexercise of a discretion. Similarly he pointed to the\ndecisions taken by members\nof the advisory committee as to when particular aspects of an application were\nto be brought to the attention\nof the DDG. These decisions, too, he argued,\namounted to the exercise of a discretion based on facts which would have been\nunknown\nto the DDG unless he read the application. The grounds of review relied\nupon were those contained in s 6(2)(\na\n)(i) and (ii) and (\nf\n)(i) of\nPAJA (quoted in para  14 above).\n[20]\tA functionary in whom a discretionary power is vested must       \nhimself exercise that power in the absence of the right to\ndelegate. In\nHofmeyr v Minister of Justice\n1992 (3) SA 108\n(C) at 117F-G King J\nformulated the rule thus:\n‘It is well established that a discretionary power vested in one\nofficial must be exercised by that official (or his lawful\ndelegate) and that,\nalthough where appropriate he may consult others and obtain their advice, he\nmust exercise his own discretion\nand not abdicate it in favour of someone else;\nhe must not, in the words of Baxter\nAdministrative Law\n(at 443),\n“pass the buck” or act under the dictation of another and, if he\ndoes, the decision which flows therefrom  is\nunlawful and a nullity.’\nAs to the reliance on the advice of another, the functionary would at the\nleast have to be aware of the grounds on which that advice\nwas given. (See\nVries v Du Plessis NO\n1967 (4) SA 469\n(SWA) 481F-G.) But it does not\nfollow that a functionary such as the DDG in the present case would have to read\nevery word of every\napplication and may not rely on the assistance of others.\nIndeed, given the circumstances, Parliament could hardly have intended\notherwise. What the functionary may not do, of course, is adopt the role of a\nrubber stamp and so rely on the advice of others that\nit cannot be said that it\nwas he who exercised the power. If in making a decision he were simply to rely\non the advice of another\nwithout knowing the grounds on which that advice was\ngiven the decision would clearly not be his. But, by the same token, merely\nbecause he was not acquainted with every fact on which the advice was based\nwould not mean that he would have failed properly to\nexercise his discretion.\nThis would be particularly so if that advice was merely one of the factors on\nwhich he relied to arrive\nat his ultimate decision. As Baxter\nAdministrative\nLaw\nat 436 says: ‘Where the delegation is very limited and the\ndelegator retains full control over the final decision the delegation\nis likely\nto be\nintra vires\n’.\nWhether therefore there has been an\nabdication of the discretionary power vested in the functionary is ultimately a\nquestion that\nmust be decided on the facts of each case. The same must apply to\nthe enquiry whether there was a delegation within the meaning of\ns 79(2) of the\nAct and s 6(2)(\na\n)(ii) of PAJA.\n[21]\tThe procedure adopted to evaluate the applications and ultimately decide\nwhich of the applicants were to be granted fishing rights\nhas been described\nabove. As observed by Schutz JA in\nMinister of Environmental Affairs and\nTourism v Phambili Fisheries (Pty) Ltd\n2003 (6) SA 407\n(SCA)  para 5 that\nprocedure was ‘a detailed and complex one’. Significantly, it was\ndevised by the DDG, or at the least\nwith his concurrence. The all important\ncriteria and the number of points allotted to each (the weighting) were\ndetermined by the\nDDG, as was the manner in which those points were to be\nawarded. This was closely circumscribed by way of guidelines, written\ninstructions\nand constant consultations with the advisory committee. Each\napplication was scored by two members of the committee acting independently\nof\neach other to ensure consistency. In these circumstances, the latitude afforded\nto the committee in determining the marks for\neach criterion was minimal. In\nmany cases the DDG himself checked the scoring, either at random regardless of\nthe score, or because\nsome aspect of the application was specifically drawn to\nhis attention, or because the sum of the marks awarded were within a mark\nor two\nof the threshold mark for the granting of the application. That mark, as I have\nsaid, was unknown to the advisory committee.\n[22]\tIn passing it is necessary to mention that there was a dispute as to\nwhether the respondent’s application was one of those\npersonally examined\nby the DDG. The reason for this was that the latter’s comment in the\nappropriate column on the spreadsheet\nreferred to advice which he subsequently\nand mistakenly identified as relating to the respondent’s appeal in\nrespect of rock\nlobster fishing rights. However, for the purpose of this\njudgment I shall assume in favour of the respondent that its application\nwas not\none of those personally examined by the DDG.\n[23]\tAs previously indicated, the DDG when finally deciding whether or not to\ngrant fishing rights to an applicant had particular\nregard to those applications\nwhich were within a mark or two of the threshold mark. The respondent’s\nscore was well below that\nmark. Given the minimal latitude afforded to the\nadvisory committee in following the ‘detailed and complex’\nprocedure,\nboth devised and closely supervised by the DDG, the failure on the\npart of the latter to examine the application itself rather than\nthe spreadsheet\nsummary would not in my view amount to an abdication of the DDG’s\ndiscretionary power in favour of the advisory\ncommittee. [24]\tThe further\ncomplaint was that the decision whether to draw any aspect to the attention of\nthe DDG was left in the\nhands of the advisory committee. This complaint,\nhowever, ignores the evidence that in the course of initial briefings and while\nthe work was in progress the DDG identified and instructed the committee as to\nthe matters that were to be brought to his attention\nso that, according to the\nDDG, it was fully aware of the limits within which it was required to operate.\nThis aspect of the committee’s\nwork was similarly, therefore, closely\ncircumscribed and indeed monitored by the DDG who in a large number of instances\nexamined\nthe applications as well as the spreadsheet summary. It follows that in\nmy view this ground of review must similarly fail and that\nthe court\na\nquo\nerred in upholding it. I should add, however, that having regard to the\nconclusion to which I have come regarding the Minister’s\ndecision on\nappeal, there is a further reason why this ground must fail. I shall refer to it\nlater.\n[25]\tI turn then to the appeal to the Minister in terms of s 80 of the Act.\nWhat was envisaged was clearly an appeal in the wide sense\ninvolving as it did a\ncomplete rehearing and a fresh determination on the merits of the application.\n(\nCf Tikly v Johannes NO\n1963 (2) SA (T) 588 at 590F-591A.) Indeed, the\nrespondent used the opportunity to place a large amount of further evidence and\ninformation\nbefore the Minister.\n[26]\tThe initial attack on the Minister’s decision not to uphold the\nappeal related solely to the question of streaming and\nthe bias in favour of\nhistorically disadvantaged persons in the new entrants category. It was\ncontended that:\n(i)\tThe Minister was insufficiently apprised of the circumstances relating to\nthe ‘formerly successful appellants’ in\nthe allocations for the 2000\nfishing season.\n(ii)\tHe perpetuated the streaming process resulting in the respondent being\ncategorised as a new entrant, notwithstanding its success\non appeal in 2000.\n(iii)\tHe failed to apply his mind to the fact that there was a bias against\napplicants in the new entrants category who were not from\nhistorically\ndisadvantaged communities.\nIn his answering affidavit the Minister refuted the contention that he had\nfailed to apply his mind in any of the respects alleged\nand endorsed the\nstreaming and the bias in favour of historically disadvantaged persons. For the\nreasons previously advanced the\ngrounds of review based on the streaming process\nand the favouring of historically disadvantaged applicants must similarly fail.\nNothing further need therefore be said of the grounds of review on which the\ninitial attack was based.\n[27]\tDuring the course of argument in the court\na quo\nthe respondent\nsought and was granted leave to introduce additional evidence pertaining to the\ntreatment of the appeals. The evidence\nwas to the effect that the reports of the\nDDG in respect of each appeal in the sector, as required by Regulation 5(3)\npromulgated\nunder the Act, had been signed by the DDG on 8 and 9 August 2002\nwhile the respondent’s appeal had been dismissed on 12 August\n2002. As\nthere were some 204 appeals (of which 173 concerned the merits) it was contended\nthat the Minister would not have had sufficient\ntime to apply his mind to each\nappeal in the manner described in his answering affidavit. This elicited a\nresponse from the Minister\nand the latter’s legal adviser, Mr Mohammed\nMoolla, who in answering affidavits said that the latter had begun working on\nthe\nappeals as early as 3 July 2002, analysing and collating them in order to\nassist the Minister. The Minister explained that between\n3 July and 9 August\n2002 he had had extensive discussions with the officials in his Department,\nincluding Moolla, regarding the procedure\nadopted by the DDG and such matters as\nthe rationale for distinguishing between 2001 rights holders and new entrants\nand the issue\nof the successful appellants in the allocations for the season of\n2000. Both deponents described how on 9 and 12 August 2002 they\nhad spent a\ntotal of 15 hours together during which each appeal was discussed and disposed\nof by the Minister. The Minister reiterated\nthat he had applied his mind to each\nand every appeal and  confirmed the contents of his earlier affidavit in which\nhe listed the\ndocuments he had before him when taking each decision. He also\ngave his reasons for rejecting the respondent’s appeal, but\nthese need not\nbe considered.\n[28]\tIn this court it was argued that the facts set out above raised various\nquestions concerning the appeal process which warranted\nan order that the matter\nbe referred for oral evidence and in particular the cross-examination of the\nMinister, the DDG and Moolla.\nThese questions were principally whether the\nMinister could have disposed of the appeals in the manner he says he did in 15\nhours;\nwhether Moolla, who had no authority to take part in the decision of the\nappeals, would have influenced the Minister; and whether\nit was possible that\nMoolla, and not the DDG, had drawn up the Regulation 5(3) reports given that the\nformer had been working on\nthe appeals since 3 July 2002 and the reports were\ndated 8 and 9 August 2002.\n[29]\tIn\nKhumalo v Director-General of Co-operation and Development\n[1990] ZASCA 118\n;\n1991 (1) SA 158\n(A) at 167G-168A the court cited with approval the conclusions\nof Kumleben J in\nMoosa Bros & Sons (Pty) Ltd v Rajah\n1975 (4) SA (D)\nat 93E-H regarding the approach to be adopted in applications to hear oral\nevidence in terms of Rule 6(5)(\ng\n). The passage is worthy of\nrepetition.\n‘(\na\n)\tAs a matter of interpretation, there is nothing in the\nlanguage of Rule \t6(5)(\ng\n) which restricts the discretionary power of the\nCourt to order the \tcross-examination of a deponent to cases in which a dispute\nof\nfact is \tshown to exist.\n(\nb\n)\tThe illustrations of “genuine” disputes of fact given\nin the\nRoom Hire\ncase at 1163 do not – and did not purport to\n– set out the \tcircumstances in which\ncross-examination\nunder the\nrelevant \tTransvaal Rule of Court could be authorised. They\na fortiori\ndo\nnot \tdetermine the circumstances in which such relief should be granted in\n\tterms of the present Rule 6(5)(\ng\n).\n(\nc\n)\tWithout attempting to lay down any precise rule, which may have\nthe \teffect of limiting the wide discretion implicit in this Rule,\nin my view\noral \tevidence in one or other form envisaged by the Rule should be allowed \tif\nthere are reasonable grounds for doubting\nthe correctness of the \tallegations\nconcerned.\n(\nd\n)\tIn reaching a decision in this regard, facts peculiarly within the\n\tknowledge of an applicant, which for that reason cannot be directly\n\tcontradicted or refuted by the opposite party, are to be carefully\n\tscrutinised.’\nSee also\nRoman Catholic Church (Klerksdorp Diocese) v Southern Life\nAssociation Ltd\n1992 (2) SA 807\n(A) at 816H-I.\n[30] \tIn the present case the facts in issue are, of course, peculiarly\nwithin the knowledge of the Minister and Moolla, and accordingly\nrequire careful\nscrutiny. But, in the absence of any other reason and none has been advanced,\nwhat would have to be established is\nthe existence of reasonable grounds for\ndoubting the correctness of the allegations concerned before a referral for oral\nevidence\nwould be justified. As emphasised by counsel for the appellant this in\neffect means the existence of reasonable grounds for disbelieving\nthe Minister\nand Moolla.\n[31]\tIn my view no such grounds have been shown to exist. It is true that on\n9 and 12 August the appeals were disposed of in a relatively\nshort period of\ntime. But it is apparent that many of the salient points that arose in the\nappeals had been the subject of extensive\ndiscussions between the Minister and\nofficials in his department in the preceding weeks. Moreover, as observed by the\nMinister, by\nthe time the hake longline sector appeals came up he had already\ndealt with about a thousand appeals and one can reasonably conclude\nthat by then\nhe would have been extremely familiar with the process.\n[32]\tAs to the possible ‘influence’ of Moolla, there can be no\nobjection to Moolla having taken the Minister through the\npapers and drawn his\nattention to salient points; nor can there be an objection to the Minister\nhaving discussed issues with Moolla,\nprovided only that the decision in each\ncase was that of the Minister. Nothing has been advanced for supposing that\nMoolla did any\nmore than this and any suggestion to the contrary is pure\nsupposition. The third question relates to the possibility that Moolla,\nand not\nthe DDG, prepared the Regulation 5(3) reports. This would appear to be founded\non no more than the non-use of the first person\nin the wording of the reports\nand the fact that they were signed and dated on 8 and 9 August 2002. In my view\nno inference can be\ndrawn from the rather formalistic style of writing adopted\nin the reports. As to the dates on which they were signed, there is no\nreason to\nsuppose that when Moolla worked with the files, which presumably came to him in\nbatches, they did not contain the DDG’s\nreports which had been prepared\nand typed but not yet signed. It follows that in my view the attack on the\nMinister’s decision\nto reject the respondent’s appeal must fail, as\nmust the application to have the matter referred for the hearing of oral\nevidence.\n[33]\tFinally, it is necessary to revert to an issue to which reference has\nbeen made previously in passing, ie the consequence of\na procedurally fair\nappeal in the event of it being found that the DDG had failed to exercise his\ndiscretionary power himself (‘the\ndelegation issue’) In\nTurner v\nJockey Club of South Africa\n1974 (3) SA 633\n(A) at 658A-G this court\naccepted as a general rule Megarry J’s dictum in\nLeary v National Union\nof Vehicle Builders\n[1971] Ch 34\nat 49F\n([1970]\n2 All ER 713\n(Ch) at\n720h) that –\n‘a failure of natural justice in the trial body cannot be cured by a\nsufficiency of natural justice in an appellate body.’\nMore recently however, in\nSlagment (Pty) Ltd v Building, Construction and\nAllied Workers’ Union\n1995 (1) SA 742\n(A) at 756D-757A, this court\nexpressed the view that such a general rule was unjustified. In coming to that\nconclusion it relied\non the statement of Lord Wilberforce in\nCalvin v Carr\nand others\n[1980] AC (PC) 574 at 592C\n([1979]\n2 All ER 440\n(PC) at\n447\nh\n) that no clear and absolute rule could be laid down as the\nsituations in which the issue arises are too diverse and the rules by\nwhich they\nare governed so various. This approach has similarly been accepted by the House\nof Lords. See\nLloyd and others v McMahon\n[1987] UKHL 5\n;\n[1987] AC 625\n(HL) at 716C-D\n([1987]\n1 All ER 1118\n(HL) at 1171\ng\n.)\n[34]\tQuite clearly, if the effect of whatever it was that vitiated the\ninitial decision is perpetuated so as to taint the appeal process\nthere can be\nno question of the latter serving to cure the former. If in the present case,\nfor example, the process of streaming\nhad been procedurally unfair, the decision\non appeal would be equally affected. On the other hand, even if the appeal\nprocess were\nnot intrinsically tainted by the earlier proceedings, the\ncircumstances may be such that considerations of fairness demand that both\nthe\ninitial administrative decision and the appeal process, judged separately, be\nlawful and procedurally fair. No purpose would\nbe served by attempting to\nformulate some all embracing rule. Each case will depend on its own facts.\n[35]\tTo return to the present case, once it is accepted that the Minister\nproperly applied his mind to the respondent’s appeal\nand that the process\nwas both lawful and procedurally fair, I can think of no reason why any\nshortcoming in relation to the delegation\nissue (which in my view was not\nestablished) should not have been cured by the appeal. There can be no question\nof the former tainting\nthe latter. The respondent was one of a large number of\napplicants for a limited resource. Had it been clear that the DDG had personally\nexamined the respondent’s application the latter would have had no cause\nfor complaint. In the event, the application, as supplemented\nby the respondent\non appeal, was considered by the Minister who was the actual repository of the\npower conferred in terms of s 18(1)\nof the Act. It follows that the decision to\nreject the respondent’s appeal would have rendered irrelevant any\ncomplaint the\nrespondent might have had with regard to the delegation issue.\n[36]\tThe appeal is upheld with costs, such costs to include those occasioned\nby the employment of two counsel. The order of the court\na quo\nis set\naside and the following is substituted in its place –\n‘The application is dismissed with costs, such costs to include those\noccasioned by the employment of two counsel.’\n__________________\nD G SCOTT\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCONCUR\n:\nFARLAM\t\tJA\nCAMERON\tJA\nLEWIS\t\tJA\nCOMRIE \t\tAJA",

    "facts": "The dispute concerned the allocation of commercial fishing rights in the hake longline sector for the 2002‑2005 season under the Marine Living Resources Act 18 of 1998. Over 5 000 applications were received for 22 sectors; the TAC for hake longline was set at 10 840 tons, of which 9 % was reserved for appeals. The Minister delegated the allocation authority to the Deputy Director‑General (DDG) who, with the assistance of a verification unit and an advisory committee, evaluated applications using a points‑based scoring system that gave greater weight to transformation criteria for new entrants. The respondent, Scenematic Fourteen (Pty) Ltd, was classified as a ‘new entrant’ and was denied rights. It challenged the allocation process, the streaming of applications into two groups, the weighting of criteria, and alleged unlawful sub‑delegation of the DDG’s discretion to the advisory committee. The case also revisited earlier failed appeals from the 2000 season and the Minister’s handling of the 2002‑2005 appeals.",
    "issues": "1. Whether the streaming of applications into ‘2001 rights holders’ and ‘new entrants’ and the heavier weighting of transformation criteria for new entrants breached procedural fairness or was unreasonable under s 6(2)(c) and s 6(2)(h) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA). 2. Whether the DDG improperly sub‑delegated his discretionary power to the advisory committee, thereby violating s 79(2) of the Marine Living Resources Act and s 6(2)(a)(ii) of PAJA. 3. Whether the Minister’s review of the appeals was conducted in a procedurally fair and rational manner. 4. Whether oral evidence should be ordered to resolve factual disputes.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the administrative law framework of PAJA, particularly the grounds of procedural unfairness, unreasonable exercise of power, and improper delegation of discretionary authority. It examined the statutory scheme under the Marine Living Resources Act, including s 18(1) (granting of fishing rights), s 79 (delegation), and s 80 (appeal rights). Relevant precedents included Bato Star Fishing (reasonableness of allocation processes), Hofmeyr v Minister of Justice (limits on delegation and abdication of discretion), and case law on oral evidence under Rule 6(5)(g). The Court reiterated that a decision‑maker may seek advice but must retain ultimate discretion, and that scoring systems are permissible where they serve consistency and fairness.",
    "application": "The Court found that the streaming and weighting were rational ways to balance the dual objectives of recognising past investment and promoting transformation. The points system was not a rigid rule but a guide, and the DDG retained the ability to adjust decisions, which he exercised. The advisory committee merely provided advice; the DDG reviewed flagged applications, especially those near the threshold, and made final choices, satisfying the requirement of personal discretion. No unlawful sub‑delegation was identified. The Minister’s handling of the appeals was shown to involve extensive discussion and adequate time, negating any claim of procedural unfairness. Consequently, the request for oral evidence was dismissed as unnecessary.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal of the Minister and the DDG was upheld. The order of the court a quo was set aside and replaced with an order dismissing the respondent’s application with costs, including those for two counsel. All grounds of review were rejected."
