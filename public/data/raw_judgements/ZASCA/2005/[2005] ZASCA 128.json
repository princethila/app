The issue to be decided is whether an action instituted\nby\nSamancor against the appellants constituted ‘a claim first made’\nagainst the appellants within the meaning of the\nphrase ‘a claim first\nmade against the insured’ in an insurance policy issued by Aegis Insurance\nCompany Ltd in respect\nof the period 1 March 1993 to 28 February 1994\n(‘the 1993 policy’). Aegis acted as lead insurer on behalf of itself\nand\nother following insurers and the respondent assumed the rights and\nobligations of Aegis in terms of the 1993 policy.\n[2]\tAt the relevant time\nthe appellants practised in partnership as consulting engineers. In terms of the\n1993 policy the insurer\nundertook to indemnify the partnership in respect of\n–\n‘Liability incurred in respect of the Practice which results in\na claim first made against the Insured during the Period of\nInsurance\nirrespective of when or where such liability arises.’\n[3]\tThe 1993\npolicy provided under the heading ‘Limit of Liability’ that the\nliability of the insurer ‘for damages\nand claimant’s costs and\nexpenses arising out of any one claim’ would not exceed\nR1 000 000. In addition the\ninsurer undertook to pay the costs and\nexpenses incurred in the conduct of any claim with the consent of the insurer.\nThe additional\nliability undertaken by the insurer was subject to the following\nproviso:\n‘However, if a payment in excess of the amount of indemnity\nunder this Insurance has to be made to dispose of a claim made against\nthe\nInsured the Insurers liability in respect of such costs and expenses shall be\nsuch proportion of the total costs and expenses\nincurred as the amount of the\nindemnity available under this Certificate bears to the total amount to dispose\nof the claim.’\n[4]\tDuring November 1993 Samancor instituted action\nagainst the partnership in which action it claimed damages on the ground of the\npartnership’s alleged breach of contract in failing to properly supervise\nthe construction of a water pipeline. The partnership,\nwith the consent of the\ninsurer, instructed attorneys to defend the action. The trial court granted\njudgment in favour of Samancor\nand a subsequent appeal by the partnership to\nthis court was dismissed.\n[5]\tAegis, together with other insurers, also\nissued a certificate of insurance to the partnership in respect of the period 1\nMarch\n1991 to 29 February 1992 (‘the 1991 policy’). The wording of\nthe 1993 policy is identical to that of the 1991 policy\nexcept that, in terms of\nthe 1991 policy, –\n(a)\nthe insurers’\nliability in respect of damages costs and expenses arising out of any one claim\nas well as costs and expenses\nincurred in the conduct of any claim was limited\nto R1 000 000; and\n(b)\nthe proviso to\nthe undertaking in respect of costs and expenses quoted above did not\napply.\n[6]\tSome time before the action in the trial\ncourt was finalised the insurer notified the partnership that it contended\nthat:\n‘(a)\tThe contract of insurance between the parties governing the\npartnership’s claim to indemnity from the insurer was\nthe 1991\nCertificate; and that\n(b)\tIn terms of the 1991 Certificate, the limit of indemnity was\nR1 000 000 inclusive of the costs and expenses incurred\nin the defence\nof the Samancor action and any subsequent appeal.’\nWhilst\npersisting in these contentions, the correctness of which the partnership did\nnot accept, the insurer agreed to continue to\nfund the costs of contesting the\nSamancor action and the costs of the appeal in order to facilitate the proper\nconclusion of the\nlitigation between Samancor and the partnership.\n[7]\tBoth\npolicies contained a condition 2 which reads as follows:\n‘The insured\nshall notify the Insurers via Glenvaal, Griffiths & Armour (Proprietary)\nLimited in writing as soon as practicable\nof\n(a)\nany claim or of the receipt\nof  notice from any person of an intention to make a claim against the\nInsured.\n(b)\tAny occurrence or circumstance of which\nthe Insured shall become aware during the Period of Insurance which may possibly\ngive\nrise to a claim under Section 1 or Section 2. Such notice having been given\nany claim to which that occurrence or circumstance has\ngiven rise which is\nsubsequently made against the Insured after the expiry of the Period of\nInsurance shall be regarded for the purposes\nof this Certificate as having been\nmade during the Period of Insurance in which so notified.’\n(Section 1 deals with ‘civil liability’.)\n[8]\tDuring May 1991\nthe appellants became aware that Samancor contended that the partnership\n‘may have breached its obligations\ntowards Samancor'. On 4 June 1991 the\nappellants, by letter of that date and in terms of condition 2(b), gave notice\nto Glenvaal\nof a potential claim by Samancor. Referring to the contract for the\nconstruction of the water pipeline the partnership wrote:\n‘Die\nAannemer, Coccianti Construction, het sy versekeraar genader vir die koste van\nherstelwerk aan, of vervanging van, die\npyplyn, Die eise-bemiddelaar van die\nversekeringsmaatskappy, Mnr R Beeby van Loss Limit Eise-bemiddelaars, het ons in\nkennis gestel\ndat ons firma moontlik deur die versekeraar aangespreek gaan word\nas party tot die geskil. Volgens hul mening was daar moontlik nalatigheid\naan\nons kant ten opsigte van gebrekkige toesighouding, aangesien die deklaag\nfilmdikte nie voor installasie van die pyp gemeet is\nom te verseker dat dit aan\ndie spesifikasie voldoen nie.\nHierdie skrywe dien slegs as `n kennisgewing\nvan `n moontlike eis. Ons sal u op hoogte hou van enige verdere\nverwikkelinge.’\n[9]\tThe appellants agree that they could have claimed\nindemnity from the insurer in terms of the 1991 policy but contend that they\nwere also entitled to do so in terms of the 1993 policy. The appellants\nobviously preferred to claim in terms of the 1993 policy\nbecause of the more\nextensive cover provided by it.\n[10]\tThe court a quo dismissed the\nappellants’ claim. It held that ‘once notification had been given on\n4 June 1991 the\nclaim  was deemed, both in terms of the plain wording of the\n1991 and the 1993 certificate and in law, to have been made’.\nThe claim\nwas therefore not first made during the period of insurance of the 1993\npolicy.\n[11]\tIn terms of the 1993 policy the insurer agreed to indemnify the\npartnership in respect of liability which ‘results in a\nclaim first\nmade’. The question to be decided is, therefore, whether the claim in\nrespect of the partnership’s liability\nto Samancor was first made when\naction was instituted, which occurred during the period of insurance of the 1993\npolicy, or whether\nthe claim was first made when written notification of the\npossibility of such a claim was given during 1991. If the former was the\ncase,\nas was submitted by the appellants, they should succeed. If the latter was the\ncase, as was submitted by the respondent, the\nappeal should be dismissed.\n[12]\tThe natural meaning of ‘claim’ is ‘a demand for\nsomething as due; an assertion of a right to something’\n(The Shorter\nOxford Dictionary).\n[1]\nThis definition\nwas also accepted, in respect of a ‘claims made’ policy, by Stocker\nLJ in\nThorman v New Hampshire Insurance Co. (U.K.) Ltd and Home Insurance\nCo.\n[1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 7 (CA) at 15. In the same case Donaldson LJ\nat 11 agreed ‘that a claim within the meaning of the\npolicy was the\nassertion by a third party against the insured of a right to some relief because\nof the breach by the insured of the\nduty referred to in section 1 of the policy,\ni.e. professional negligence’.\n[13]\tIn\nRobert Irving & Burns (a\nfirm) v Stone and Others\n[1998] Lloyd’s Rep IR 258 (CA) at 261\nStaughton LJ said that ‘in the ordinary meaning of the English language\nthe words\n“claims made” indicate that there has been a communication\nby the client to the [insured] surveyor of some discontent\nwhich will, or may,\nresult in a remedy expected from the surveyor. There must, I say, be\ncommunication.’ It was suggested that\nthis statement by Staughton LJ is\nauthority for the proposition that notification of a possibility that a claim\nmay be made constituted\na claim. I do not agree. Firstly, it is not clear what\nStaughton LJ had in mind when he referred to an indication of discontent.\nSecondly, the nature of the claim was not in issue in the case, the issue was\nwhether the claim had to be communicated in order to\nconstitute a ‘claim\nmade’. Thirdly, Staughton LJ, although he referred extensively to the\njudgments in\nThorman\n,  did  not express any disagreement with the meaning\nascribed to ‘claim’ in that case. In the circumstances I doubt that\nStaughton LJ intended to ascribe a different meaning to\n‘claim’.\n[14]\tIn this case no demand was made against the\nappellants and they did not give the respondent notice of any demand. The\nappellants\nwere merely notified of a possibility that a demand may be made in\nthe future. No assertion of liability on the part of the appellants\nwas made\neither. The appellants were merely notified that there was a possibility of\nnegligence on the part of the appellants. In\nthe last paragraph of the letter it\nwas expressly stated that the letter only served as notification of a possible\nclaim i.e. that\nthe letter was not a notification of a claim.\n[15]\tCounsel\nfor the respondent submitted that the phrase ‘claims first made’ in\nthe 1993 policy should not be given its\nnatural meaning but should be\ninterpreted so as to include the communication to the insured of a potential\nclaim. He submitted that\nsupport for his submission is to be found in conditions\n2(b) and 8 of the 1993 policies. He submitted, furthermore, that ‘claims\nmade’ policies such as the 1991 and 1993 policies would be unworkable if a\ndifferent interpretation were to be given to the\nphrase.\n[16]\tCondition 2(b)\nrequires the insured to give notice of any occurrence of which he may become\naware during the period of insurance\nand which may possibly give rise to a\nclaim. The partnership became aware of such an occurrence during the period of\ninsurance of\nthe 1991 certificate and gave the required notice. Having given the\nnotice the Samancor claim eventually made against the partnership\nis regarded\n‘for the purposes of (the 1991 certificate) as having been made during the\nPeriod of Insurance’. It is therefore\nclear that in terms of the 1991\ncertificate the written notification on 4 June 1991 is to be regarded as the\nmaking of a claim for\npurposes of the 1991 certificate and not for other\npurposes.\n[17]\tThe written notice given by the appellants was not given in\nrespect of an occurrence of which they became aware during the period\nof\ninsurance of the 1993 policy. Condition 2(b) in the 1993 certificate, therefore,\ndoes not apply. In any event the condition does\nnot provide that a notification\nof an occurrence which may possibly give rise to a claim during a period of\ninsurance preceding the\nperiod of insurance of the 1993 policy is to be\nregarded, for purposes of the 1993 certificate, as a claim made during the\npreceding\nperiod of insurance.\n[18]\tCounsel for the respondent submitted that\nan interpretation of ‘claim first made’ which excludes the \nnotification\nto the insured of the possibility of a claim would render\n‘claims made’ professional indemnity policies unworkable in\nthat an\ninsured may not be able to secure insurance cover for a subsequent period\nbecause of the possible claim which he will have\nto disclose. However, it is for\nthis very reason that a condition such as 2(b) is included in professional\nindemnity policies (see\nMacGillivray on Insurance Law\n10\nth\ned\nat para 28-81; Clarke\nThe Law of Insurance Contracts\n4\nth\ned\nat para 17-4D4; and Simpson\nProfessional Negligence and Liability\nat para\n5.97).\n[19]\tCondition 8 provides as follows:\n‘The Insurers will not\navoid this Certificate on the grounds\n(a)\nof failure on the part of\nthe Insured at any time to disclose to the Insurers facts material to the\nassessment of the risk.\n(b)\nthat the Insured\nmade an incorrect representation of a nature likely to have materially affected\nthe assessment of the risk under\nthis\ninsurance\nProvided that\n(a)\nthe Insured proves that such\nalleged non-disclosure or misrepresentation was innocent and free from\nfraudulent conduct or intent on\nthe part of the\nInsured\n(b)\twhere the Insured could have notified\nunder any preceding insurance circumstances which could give rise to a claim any\nindemnity\nin respect thereof to which the Insured may be entitled under Section\n1 shall not be greater or wider in scope than the indemnity\nto which the Insured\nwould have been entitled under such preceding insurance.’\n[20]\tCounsel\nfor the respondent submitted that condition 8 reflects an intention that\n‘(w)here the insured notifies the insurer\nof circumstances which could\ngive rise to a claim during a period of insurance, then any liability arising\nfrom that claim is covered\nby, and is restricted to, that certificate,\nirrespective when the summons is served or liability is determined’.\nI\ndo not agree.\n[21]\tCondition 8 deals with the avoidance of the policy in the\nevent of a failure to disclose material facts or in the event of a\nmaterially\nincorrect representation. In the present case there is no allegation of such a\nfailure or incorrect representation. The\ncondition, therefore, does not find\napplication in the present case. The condition does not provide that in the\nevent of a disclosure\nhaving been made the insured would not be entitled to\n‘indemnity . . . wider in scope than the indemnity to which\nthe\nInsured would have been entitled under such preceding\ninsurance’.\n[22]\tIn my view there is no reason why the word 'claim'\nshould not be given its natural meaning. The appellants were free to negotiate\nmore extensive cover in respect of periods subsequent to the insurance period in\nwhich they had given notice of the potential Samancor\nclaim. They could have\nnegotiated such cover with the respondent or another insurer. In such\nnegotiations they were of course obliged\nto disclose the potential claim. Such\ndisclosure was made to the respondent and it was up to the respondent to either\nrefuse to provide\nextra cover, to provide extra cover at an appropriate premium\nor to provide extra cover excluding liability in respect of the potential\nclaim.\nIt is common to find a condition in a ‘claims made’ policy which\nexpressly excludes ‘liability arising out\nof any circumstances or\noccurrences notified under any other policy attaching prior to the commencement\nof the policy, or which were\nknown to the assured prior to the commencement of\nthe policy’ (see\nMacGillivray on Insurance Law\n10\nth\ned\nat para 28-84). Such a condition is not contained in the 1993 policy. The policy\ncovers claims first made during the insurance\nperiod of the 1993 policy. The\nSamancor claim was first made during that period as the notification of a\npotential claim did not\nconstitute the making of a claim. The result is that the\nappellants were entitled to claim under the 1993 policy notwithstanding\nthe fact\nthat they could also claim a lesser amount in terms of the 1991 policy. There is\nin my view no absurdity in this result\nas was contended by the respondent to be\nthe case.\n[23]\tThe respondent contended in the alternative that it has\nalready discharged its obligations in terms of the 1993 policy i.e. its\nliability to pay R1 000 000 in respect of the Samancor-claim for\ndamages and costs and its liability to pay the appellants’\ncosts and\nexpenses incurred in the conduct of the Samancor-claim.\n[24]\tAs stated above\nthe respondent agreed, whilst persisting in the contention that the appellants\nwere only entitled to indemnification\nin terms of the 1991 policy, to fund the\ncosts of contesting the Samancor action and the costs of the appeal. The funding\nso provided\namounted to R2 072 292. It is common cause that in terms\nof the proviso to the undertaking by the insurer to pay the partnership’s\ncosts and expenses incurred in the conduct of a claim, which proviso is quoted\nabove, only an amount of R568 366 was payable\nby the respondent in respect\nof such costs. The respondent, therefore, overpaid an amount of\nR1 503 926. The submission\nof the respondent is that whereas it was in\nterms of the 1993 policy obliged to pay a total amount of R1 568 366\nto the\nappellants it paid an amount of R2 072 292 to them.\n[25]\tIn\nmy view there is no merit in the submission. No portion of the amount paid by\nthe respondent was paid in respect of Samancor’s\nclaim for capital and\ncosts. The amount paid was paid in terms of an undertaking to fund the\nproceedings. Not surprisingly the respondent\ndid not institute a counterclaim\nfor payment of the difference between R1 503 926 and the\nR1 000 000 which was\npayable in respect of such capital and\ncosts.\n[26]\tFor these reasons the following order is made:\n(a)\nThe appeal succeeds with\ncosts.\n(b)\nThe order by the court a quo is set\naside and replaced with the following\norder:\n‘The respondent is ordered to pay an\namount of R1 000 000 together with interest on the sum of\nR1 000 000\ncalculated at the rate of 15,5% per annum from 30 June\n1998, plus costs.’\n________________\nSTREICHER JA\nCONCUR\n:\nNAVSA JA)\nMTHIYANE JA)\nCACHALIA AJA)\nZULMAN  JA\n[27]\tI have had the privilege of reading the judgment of my colleague\nStreicher JA. Whilst I agree with his conclusions I prefer to\napproach the\nmatter on the following basis.\n27.1\tIt is common cause that the appellants\nare entitled to indemnity from the respondent in terms of a professional\nindemnity policy\nissued on 6 March 1991 under a certificate of insurance no\n01218/91 covering the period 1 March 1991 to 29 February 1992 (the 1991\npolicy);\n27.2\tThe issue for determination in this appeal is whether the\nappellants are entitled to indemnity from the respondent in terms of\nboth the\n1991 policy and a policy issued on 4 March 1993 and embodied in certificate of\ninsurance no 01218/93 and covering the period\n1 March 1993 to 29 February 1994\n(the 1993 policy) and can choose which; and\n27.3\tIf the 1993 policy applies,\nthe appellant’s claim for indemnity in an amount of R1 000 000\nfalls to be reduced.\n[28]\nThe court\na quo\n(Motata J) held,\ndismissing the appellant’s claim, that it was the 1991 policy that\napplied. The appeal is brought with the\nleave of the court\na\nquo\n.\n[29]\tThe parties, with the consent of the court\na quo\n,\nproceeded to trial only on the above issue. By agreement they placed their\nevidence before Motata J by way of a stated case read\ntogether with an agreed\nbundle of documents. The following common cause facts emerge from the stated\ncase:\n29.1\tThe appellants, a partnership of consulting engineers, contracted\nthe two policies with insurers led by the respondent who assumed\nall the rights\nand obligations in respect of the policies.\n29.2\tDuring May 1991, the\nappellants became aware that a water pipeline which had been constructed in\nSteelport had corroded. The\nappellants had been appointed as Consulting Civil\nEngineer by Samancor Limited (Samancor) in regard to the\nconstruction.\n29.3\tThe pipeline corroded as a result of insufficient\nthickness in the protective coating lining its pipes. Samancor contended that\nthe appellants ‘may’ have breached their obligations towards\nSamancor by failing to detect the defects in the pipeline\nin the course of\nsupervision of its construction.\n29.4\tOn 4 June 1991, in a letter of that\ndate, the appellant gave notice to Glenvaal, Griffiths and Armour (Pty) Limited\n(Glenvaal),\nacting on behalf of the respondent of the potential claim by\nSamancor. The first sentence of the concluding paragraph of the letter\nreads:\n‘Hierdie skrywe dien slegs as ‘n kennisgewing van ‘n\nmoontlike eis.’\n29.5\tDuring November 1993, Samancor instituted action\nin the High Court against the appellants and the contractors who constructed\nthe\npipeline.\n29.6\tImmediately after service of the summons on the appellants the\nappellants handed the summons to Glenvaal.\n29.7\tIn the Samancor action,\nSamancor claimed damages from the appellants on the ground of their alleged\nbreach of contract in failing\nto properly supervise the construction of the\npipeline.\n29.8\tOn 30 June 1998 the High Court gave judgment in favour of\nSamancor against the appellants for damages in an amount of R973 544,48\ntogether with costs inclusive of the costs of two counsel and the qualifying\nfees of two expert witnesses.\n29.9\tThe appellants appealed to this Court. On\n13 November 2000 the appeal was dismissed with costs, inclusive of the costs of\ntwo\ncounsel, save that the order of the High Court was altered by the\nsubstitution of an amount of R910 570,00 for the amount of\nR973 544,48.\n29.10\tThe liability of the appellants to Samancor totalled\nR3 646, 000, 58 comprised as follows:\n29.10.1\tCapital \t\t\t\tR  910 570,00;\n29.10.2\tInterest on the aforesaid\ncapital at the rate of 15,5%\nper annum calculated from\nand including 30 June 1998\nto and including date of\npayment thereof. As at\n30 June 2001 such interest\ntotaled\t\t\t\tR    423 415,00\n29.10.3\tSamancor’s taxed costs in\nthe High Court action\t\tR 1 113,327,66\n29.10.4\tSamancor’s taxed costs in\nthe appeal\t\t\t\tR 1 198 737,87.\n29.11\tThe respondent paid the appellants’ costs and\nexpenses of the appellants in the action, counsel and expert witnesses incurred\nin the conduct of the defence of the action and the subsequent appeal to this\nCourt, which costs and expenses totalled R2 072 292,48.\nIt did not pay\nthe capital amount or interest thereon.\n29.12\tThe respondent whilst\ncontending that the 1991 policy governed the appellants claim to indemnity, the\nlimit of which was R1 000 000\ninclusive of the costs and expenses\nincurred in the defence of the Samancor action and any subsequent appeal, agreed\nto continue\nto fund the costs of contesting the said action and the costs of the\nappeal ‘in order to facilitate the proper conclusion of\nthe litigation\nbetween Samancor’ and the appellants, ‘the funds for the purposes of\nwhich were not available to the’\nappellants.\n30.1\tConditions 2(a) and\n2(b) in both the 1991 and 1993 policies are in identical terms. They provide as\nfollows:\n‘2.\tThe Insured shall notify the Insurers via Glenvaal, Griffiths &\nArmour (Proprietary) Limited in writing as soon as\npracticable of\n(a)\tany claim or of the receipt of notice from any person of an intention to\nmake a claim against the Insured.\n(b)\tany occurrence or circumstance of which the Insured shall become aware\nduring the Period of Insurance which may possibly give\nrise to a claim under\nSection 1 or Section 2. Such notice having been given any claim to which that\noccurrence or circumstance has\ngiven rise which is subsequently made against the\ninsured after the expiry of the Period of Insurance shall be regarded for the\npurposes\nof this Certificate as having been made during the Period of Insurance\nin which so notified.’\n30.2\tBoth the 1991 and 1993 policies\nprovide for a limit of indemnity of R1 000 000,00 and describe the\nrisk insured in\nidentical terms.\n30.3\tHowever the two policies differ in\ntheir treatment of own costs and expenses. The 1991 policy includes these costs\nin the limit\nof indemnity of R1 000 000,00 whilst the 1993 policy adds\nthem to the limit of indemnity.\n[31]\tNot surprisingly the appellants chose to\nbase their claim upon the 1993 policy as the extent of the indemnity provided in\nit\nis greater than in the 1991 policy. As I have already indicated, the\nappellants contend that although they are also entitled to indemnity\nin respect\nof the 1991 policy, that they can choose the policy under which to\nclaim.\n32.1\tThe respondent contends that having regard to the nature and\npurpose of the 1993 policy and the relevant background circumstances\nwhich were\nprobably present to the minds of the parties and which explain ‘the\ngenesis and purpose of the contract’:\n32.1.1\tBoth the 1991 and 1993\npolicies are what are termed ‘claims-made’ policies;\n32.1.2\tThe\nclaim was first made in the period of the 1991 policy;\n6.1.3\tThe 1993 policy\ncovers only‘ claims first made’ during its currency;\n32.1.4\tThe\nparties could not have intended that a claim which was first made in 1991 was in\nfact first made in 1993 which it submits\nis, in effect, what the appellants\nargue.\n32.2\tThe respondent accordingly contends that the appellants’\nclaim is governed by the 1991 policy, with its lesser cover of\nR1 000 000,00\ninclusive of costs and expenses incurred in the defence of the Samancor action\nand subsequent appeal, and not the 1993\npolicy which covers such costs. I do not\nagree.\n32.3\tThe respondent’s counsel has referred to a number of\nEnglish cases and leading English text books on Insurance Law where\nthe meaning\nof, and the reasons for so called ‘claims first made’ in\nprofessional indemnity policies such as the policies\nunder consideration are\ndiscussed.\n[2]\nHowever in none of these\ncases or text books are two distinct policies considered in the context of the\ncase before this court where\na ‘claim first made’ under one policy\nis deemed to be a claim made under a later or another policy.\n33.1\tThe\nnotification of 4 June 1991\n[3]\nduring\nthe period of the 1991 policy of a ‘moontlike eis’ or potential or\ncircumstances likely to give rise to a claim\nconstitutes a notice in terms of\ncondition 2(b) of an ‘occurrence or circumstance’ during the period\nof insurance which\nmay possibly give rise to a claim under the policy.\n(See\nfor example the Canadian case of\nMoore v Canadian Lawyers Ins\nAssn\n[4]\nreferred to in Clarke-\nThe Law of Insurance Contracts\n[5]\n)\nThis would entitle the appellants to claim under the 1991 policy.\n33.2\tIn\nNovember 1993 during the period of the 1993 policy the appellants gave notice to\nGlenvaal of an actual claim made against\nthem.\n[6]\n33.3\tThe fact that the\nappellants are entitled to claim under the 1991 policy does not, in my view,\ndisentitle them from claiming\nunder the 1993 policy should they so choose, as\nthey indeed did. This notwithstanding the deeming provision set out in the\nsecond\nsentence of condition 2(b). The deeming provision, upon a proper\nconstruction thereof, applies to a notice given during the period\nof the 1993\npolicy and not to a notice given in another period under another policy such as\nthe 1991 policy.  The 1991 and 1993 policies\nare distinct and different policies\nconcluded at different times and for different periods and differing in certain\nrespects more\nparticularly regarding the extent of the cover afforded. There is\nno direct reference whatsoever, as there could have been, in the\n1993 policy to\nthe 1991 policy. I do not believe that one may legitimately infer or imply such\na reference. The insurer had it wished\nto incorporate such a reference could\neasily have inserted appropriate wording in the 1993 policy. It did not do so.\nThe 1993 policy\ndoes not exclude claims previously made, neither is there a\nproportional reduced premium in respect of double insurance. It was plainly\nopen\nto the insurer when the 1993 policy was negotiated, either to refuse to insure\nthe appellants, or to increase the premium payable,\nor not to change the premium\npayable because of the notification that the appellants had given during the\ncurrency of the 1991 policy\nof a potential claim which in fact eventuated in the\nactual claim notified during the period of the 1993 policy. There is no evidence\nthat they increased or changed the premium payable when issuing the 1993 policy.\nFurthermore it would have been open to the appellants\nto have sought insurance\ncover from another insurance company after the expiry of the 1991 policy. Even\nif they disclosed the fact\nto the proposed new insurer that they had given\nnotice of a potential claim to their previous insurer and a new policy was\nissued,\nthis would not have entitled the new insurer, in the absence of\nappropriate wording, to invoke a condition such as condition 2(b)\nto contend\nthat the notice given to its previous insurer was to be regarded as a notice of\n‘first claim’ under the new\npolicy.\n33.4\tNo notification was\ngiven during the period of the 1993 policy in terms of condition 2(b) of an\n‘occurrence or circumstance’\nof which the appellants were aware. I\nrepeat that the notice which was given in November 1993 was a notice in terms of\nclause 2(a)\nof an actual claim.\n34.1\tThe respondent also contends that the\nproviso contained in General Condition 8(b) which is in identical terms in both\nthe 1991\nand 1993 policies is of assistance in the interpretation of condition\n2. I again do not agree.\nThe condition reads:\n‘8.\tThe Insurers will\nnot avoid this Certificate on the grounds ...\nProvided\nthat\n(a)\t...\n(b)\twhere the Insured could have notified under any\npreceeding insurance circumstances which could give rise to a claim any\nindemnity\nin respect thereof to which the Insured may be entitled under Section\n1 shall not be greater or wider in scope than the indemnity\nto which  the\nInsured would have been entitled under such preceding\ninsurance.’\n34.2\tThe general condition is there, in my view, to cater\nfor non-disclosure of a claim or potential claim during a prior period of\ninsurance. If there was no disclosure but there was no increase in the cover\ngranted in the new period of insurance the fact of the\nnon-disclosure would be\nirrelevant. If the cover was increased the non-disclosure would entitle the\ninsurer to limit its liability\nto the cover provided in the first\nperiod.\n34.3\tI accordingly do not believe that condition 8(b) is of\nassistance or relevant in interpreting condition 2 and in deciding whether\nthe\n1991 or 1993 policy is of application.\n35.1\tIn the alternative the respondent\ncontends that in the event that it is found that the 1993 policy applies to the\nappellants’\nclaim the reference to ‘such costs and expenses’\nin the 1993 policy is a reference to the costs and expenses of the appellants\nreferred to in paragraph 3.11 above which totaled\nR2 072 292,48.\n35.2\tThe 1993 policy provides, under the heading\n‘Costs and Expenses’ that:\nCosts and Expenses\n‘The Insurers will pay, in\naddition to the Limit of Indemnity under Section 1, costs and expenses incurred\nin the conduct of\nany claim subject to the Insurers consent (such consent not to\nbe unreasonably withheld) in respect of any occurrence or circumstance\nthat has\ngiven rise to or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim, which would\nbe indemnifiable in terms of Section 1.\nHowever, if a payment in excess of\nthe amount of indemnity under this Insurance has to be made to dispose of a\nclaim made against\nthe Insured the insurers liability in respect of such costs\nand expenses shall be such proportion of the total costs and expenses\nincurred\nas the amount of the indemnity this Certificate bears to the total amount to\ndispose of the claim\n.’\nThe words underlined by me in the above\npassage indicate the additional wording that appears in the 1993 policy but not\nin the 1991\npolicy.\n35.3\tThe aforesaid costs and expenses totaling\nR2 072 292,48 were costs and expenses incurred by the appellants with\nthe\nconsent of the respondent in the course of contesting the Samancor action\nand the appeal consequent\nthereupon.\n[7]\n35.4\tThe total\npayment that had to be made to Samancor to dispose of Samancor’s claim\nagainst the partnership was\nR3 646 050,58.\n[8]\nThe amount\nof R3 646 050,58 exceeded the limit of the capital indemnity in the\n1993 policy of R1 000 000,00 by\nR2 646 050,58.\n35.5\tThe\nproportion of the limit of indemnity (R1 000 000,00) to the total\namount payable to Samancor to dispose of its\nclaim (R3 646 050,58)\naccording to the respondent was 1:\n3,64605058.\n[9]\n35.6\tThe respondent\ntherefore contends that its liability in respect of the costs and expenses of\nR2 072 292,48 was the\nabove proportion i.e. R568 366,34,\nexpressed by the following equation:\n1 000 000 :\n3 646 050,58 (1:3 646 050,58)\n568 366,34 :\n2 072 292,48\n(1 :3 646 050,58)\n[10]\n.\n35.7\tThe\nrespondent accordingly contends that its obligation to indemnify the appellants\nin respect of their liability to Samancor\nis limited to R1 000 000\nless the extent by which the total amount actually paid by the respondent in\nrespect of own costs\nand expenses (R2 072 292,48) exceeds its actual\nliability in respect thereof of R568 366,34, viz. R1 503 926,14\n(i.e. R2 072 292,48 minus R568 366,34). The aforesaid figure of\nR1 503 926,14 exceeds the limit of indemnity\nof\nR1 000 000\n[11]\n. In the\npremises, the respondent argues that it has already indemnified the appellants\nby an amount R1 503 926,14 in excess\nof the limit of indemnity, and is\nnot obligated to indemnify the appellants further. The argument is without\nsubstance.\n35.8\tThe 1993 policy grants two separate and distinct indemnities\nto the appellants. An indemnity against liability for damages and\nclaimants\ncosts and expenses arising out of any one claim, in a sum not exceeding\nR1 000 000. In addition to the aforesaid\nsum of R1 000 000\nan indemnity is granted in respect of ‘costs and expenses incurred (by the\ninsured) in the conduct\nof any claim subject to the insurer’s\nconsent’. The\nproviso\nto this indemnity in respect of the\nappellants’ own costs and expenses is that ‘if a payment in excess\nof the amount\nof indemnity under this Insurance has to be made to dispose of a\nclaim made against the Insured the Insurer’s liability in\nrespect of such\ncosts and expenses shall be such proportion of the total cost and expenses\nincurred as the amount of the indemnity\navailable under this Certificate bears\nto the total amount to dispose of the claim.’\n35.9\tThe\nrespondent’s calculations set out above appear to be correct. However, the\nappellants were in terms of the 1993 policy\nentitled to be indemnified by the\ninsurer in the two respects referred to above and in two\namounts:\n35.9.1\tR1 000 000 in respect of the capital amount of\ndamages, interest and costs which the appellants were ordered to pay\nto\nSamancor;\n35.9.2\tAn amount of not less than R568 366,48 in respect of\nthe appellant’s own costs and expenses incurred in defending\nthemselves\nagainst the claim of Samancor.\n35.10\tAs appears from the stated\ncase,\n[12]\nthe respondent paid the\nappellant’s costs and expenses of the second defendant in the action [a\nfirm of attorneys who were\nalso sued by the appellants but who play no part in\nthis appeal] incurred in the conduct of the defence of the Samancor action and\nthe subsequent appeal to this court. The appellants were accordingly not\nentitled to any further indemnity in that regard.\n35.11\tAs the respondent\nmade no payment to or for the benefit of the appellants to indemnify them\nagainst the capital amount of damages,\ninterest or their own costs and which\namount is in excess of R1 000 000,00 it follows that the respondent\nwas in breach\nof its obligations arising from the 1993 policy and was obliged to\nindemnify the appellant by payment to them of a limited sum of\nR1 000 000.\n---------------------------------------\nR\nH ZULMAN\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\n[1]\nSee also\nBoshoff v South\nBritish Insurance Company Ltd\n1951 (3) SA 481\n(T) at\n485B.\n[2]\nRobert Irving &\nBurns v Stone and Others\n[1998] IRLR258 (CA),\nFriends Provident Life\n& Pensions Limited v Sirius International Insurance Corporation\n[2005]\nIRLR 135\n(Q) at 141-142 and\nTioxide Europe Limited v CGU International\nInsurance\nPCL\n[2005] IRLR 114\n(Q) pp 121-122 and 126.

    "facts": "The appellants, a partnership of consulting engineers (Piet Van Immerzeel and Strat Pohl), were covered by two professional indemnity policies: a 1991 policy (covering 1 March 1991 – 29 February 1992) and a 1993 policy (covering 1 March 1993 – 28 February 1994). In June 1991 they received notice that Samancor might claim against them for alleged supervision failures on a water‑pipeline project and gave the insurer written notice of this possible claim. In November 1993 Samancor instituted legal proceedings against the partnership for breach of contract, which resulted in a judgment awarding Samancor damages of approximately R973,544 plus costs and interest. The partnership defended the action with the insurer’s consent, and the insurer later funded the defence costs (R2,072,292). The dispute centred on whether the claim was \"first made\" under the 1993 policy or whether the earlier 1991 notice deemed the claim as first made under the 1991 policy, affecting the extent of indemnity payable.",
    "issues": "1. Whether a written notice of a potential claim in 1991 constitutes a \"claim first made\" for the purposes of the 1993 professional indemnity policy. 2. Which policy – the 1991 or the 1993 – governs the appellants' entitlement to indemnity. 3. How the insurer’s liability for costs and expenses should be calculated under the 1993 policy’s proviso.",
    "principles": "The Court applied the ordinary meaning of \"claim\" as a demand for relief, not merely a notification of a possible claim, following precedents such as Thorman v New Hampshire Insurance and Robert Irving & Burns v Stone. Condition 2(a) and 2(b) of the policies were interpreted to deem a claim as made only when an actual demand is received during the policy period. The earlier 1991 notice was held to be a mere notice of a potential claim, not a claim. Condition 8 concerning non‑disclosure was found inapplicable. Each policy was regarded as a distinct contract; no implied reference to the earlier policy could alter the 1993 policy's terms.",
    "application": "Applying the principles, the Court concluded that the Samancor action in November 1993 was the first actual claim and occurred within the 1993 policy period. Consequently, the 1993 policy, which provides a R1,000,000 limit for damages plus a proportional entitlement for costs, governed the indemnity. The insurer had overpaid the partnership’s costs (R2,072,292) against the proportionate entitlement (R568,366), but this did not affect the insurer’s obligation to pay the R1,000,000 limit for the claim itself. The Court set aside the lower court’s decision and ordered the insurer to pay the full amount under the 1993 policy.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal succeeded. The order of the court a quo was set aside. The respondent (Santam Ltd) was ordered to pay the appellants R1,000,000 together with interest at 15.5% per annum from 30 June 1998, plus costs."
