They sought\nan urgent\norder in the Land Claims Court (LCC) that they be permitted\nto bury the deceased at the Dlamini family burial site on the farm\nBockenhoud\nFontein (Bockenhoud), alternatively that they be permitted\nto bury her at a burial site on the farm Sandspruit. They based their\ncause of action on section 6(2)(dA) of the Extension of Security of\nTenure Act 62 of 1997 (the Act)\n1\n.\nIntroduced by amendment\n2\nin 2001, the section permits an âoccupierâ who resides on land,\nwhich belongs to another person:\nâ\nto bury a deceased member of his or her family who,\nat the time of that personâs death, was residing on the land on\nwhich the occupier\nis residing, in accordance with their religion or\ncultural belief, if an established practice in respect of the land\nexists;\nâ\nAn âestablished practiceâ is defined in section 1(1)\nof the Act to mean:\nâ\nA practice in terms of which the owner or person in\ncharge or his or her predecessor in title routinely gave permission\nto people\nresiding on the land to bury deceased members of their\nfamily on that land in accordance with their religion or cultural\nbelief.\nâ\n3\n[2]\tThe LCC (Bam JP) refused to permit the burial, but\ngranted leave to appeal against its decision to this court. In the\ninterim,\nthe deceased was buried elsewhere. The appellants however\nreserved their right to apply to the provincial authority for the\nexhumation\nof the deceasedâs remains for reburial should the appeal\nsucceed.\n4\nAccordingly, in these proceedings, the appellants seek a declaratory\norder that they are entitled to bury the deceased on either\nof the\nfarms. The appeal has crystallized around three issues:\n(i)\twhether the word âlandâ as used in s 6(2)(dA) is\nconfined to its    cadastral description or has a different meaning\nbecause,\nunless it has a wider meaning, the deceased cannot be buried\non Bockenhoud;\n(ii) \tif the deceased cannot be buried on Bockenhoud\nwhether the appellants had proved that it was âin accordance with\ntheir religion\nor cultural beliefsâ for the deceased to be buried\non the farm Sandspruit; and if so\n(iii)\twhether the respondents were entitled to terminate\nthe appellantsâ right to bury the deceased on Sandspruit\nunilaterally,\nonce burials had become an established practice.\n[3]\tBefore dealing with these issues it is necessary to\nembark upon a brief excursus of the relevant facts. Members of the\nJoosten\nfamily own three farms adjacent to each other in the New\nHanover area of KwaZulu-Natal, and have so for generations. The farms\nare\nBockenhoud, Sandspruit and Mount Elias. Each farm is registered\nas a separate piece of land. Bockenhoud is owned by Hogard Joosten,\nthe father of three sons, Philip, Andre and Manfred. He inherited the\nfarm from his parents in 1981, but had farmed it for his own\naccount\nfrom 1965 until 1995.\n[4]\tSandspruit and Mount Elias are owned by Andre and\nPhilip respectively, having been purchased from their father in 1995.\nThe brothers\nfarm their respective farms each for his own account.\n[5]\tThe closely-knit family reside in three family homes\nwithin a kilometre of each other on two of the three farms. The\nJoostens\nare not only well aware of what takes place on each of their\nfarms, but conduct farming operations in consultation with each\nother.\nThey also share the same labour force.\n[6]\tThe first appellantâs late parents lived on\nBockenhoud and worked for Hogard. They are buried at a burial site on\nthat farm.\nThe first appellant and the deceased were employed by\nHogard and resided on Bockenhoud since 1974. At the time Bockenhoud\nand Sandspruit\nwere farmed as a single unit. In about 1986, the first\nappellant and the deceased, at Hogardâs instance, moved willingly\nfrom their\nhomestead on Bockenhoud to a new homestead on Sandspruit.\nThe first appellantâs parents remained on Bockenhoud.\n[7]\tOver the years Hogard allowed the Dlamini family to\nbury their dead at a burial site on Bockenhoud, some 50 meters from\ntheir\nhomestead, where the first appellantâs parents are buried.\nThere are other burial spots on the farm where two other families\nhave\nalso buried their deceased.\n[8]\tThe Joostens have also routinely given permission\nfor various families living on Sandspruit to bury their dead on that\nfarm. One\nDlamini, a child, is buried there and the last burial that\ntook place here was of an infant from the Mzizi family. In July 2002\nAndre\ninformed them that the practice of allowing burials on\nSandspruit would henceforth be stopped. There have been no further\nburials\non this farm since then.\n[9]\tWhen the deceased died at the Dlamini homestead on 5\nJune 2004, Philip, who was temporarily in charge of the farm while\nAndre\nwas abroad, refused permission for the burial on the farm\nprecipitating the present dispute.\n[10]\tI turn to a consideration of the first of the\nissues referred to above, whether the word âlandâ is confined to\nits cadastral\ndescription, as the court\na quo\nfound, or whether, depending on the circumstances of a particular\ncase, it may have a different meaning, as contended by the\nappellants.\nThe respondentsâ case is that because the Dlamini\nburial site is on Bockenhoud, the appellants are not entitled to bury\nthe deceased\nthere because the deceased did not reside on the farm;\nat the time of her death she and her family resided on Sandspruit,\nwhich is\nadjacent to Bockenhoud. The two farms have distinct\ncadastral boundaries on the Surveyor Generalâs map and are\nregistered as separate\nfarms.\n[11]\tHaving left their homestead in Bockenhoud in 1986,\nlong before the amending Act was passed in 2001, it is apparent that\nthe Dlamini\nfamily can claim no right to bury deceased members of\ntheir family on Bockenhoud if the respondentsâ contention that\nBockenhoud\nand Sandspruit are distinct pieces of land is correct.\nThis is because s 6(2)(dA) of the Act explicitly confers on people\nresiding\non land burial rights in respect of a deceased family member\nwho was an occupier of the land, only on the land where the occupier\nand the deceased family  resided at the time of the deceasedâs\ndeath. The fact that the first appellant and the deceased resided\non\nBockenhoud before the amending Act was passed does not avail them\nbecause the Act did not create rights retrospectively.\n[12]\tTo overcome this hurdle, the appellants were driven\nto contend that the word âlandâ, as it is used in the Act, need\nnot be\nconfined to its cadastral description, but may be described\ndifferently, depending on the facts of a particular case.\n[13]\tIn the instant matter the appellants contend that\nconsiderations other than the boundaries of the land registered in\nthe deeds\noffice must be taken into account in deciding whether an\noccupier can claim any rights on it. They submit that the three farms\nmust\nbe regarded as the same land because they have effectively been\nfarmed by the father and sons as a single unit; that it had not been\napparent to the first appellant which of the Joostens was responsible\nfor farming particular portions of the farm; that the boundaries\nbetween the farms were neither material nor apparent; and that the\nfirst appellant worked on the farms Bockenhoud and Sandspruit\nnever\nappreciating that they were different parcels of land.\n[14]\tThe contention that the meaning of words in a\nstatute may vary, depending on the facts of a particular case, has no\nlegal foundation.\nThe word âlandâ is not defined in the Act. But\nit is apparent that in the context within which it is used, it can\nrefer only\nto land that is registered in the name of an owner. This\nis because the Act regulates the relationship between occupiers of\nland\nand owners of the same land.\n5\n[15]\tA right of burial may be claimed by an occupier of\nland only where a practice has been established by the routine\ngranting of\npermission for such a practice by the owner or person in\ncharge of the land (s 6(2)(dA)). A person is quite clearly not\nlawfully\nentitled to grant permission for burial on land which he\ndoes not own or is not âin charge ofâ. The fact that the owners\nof adjacent\nland are related to each other, as in this case, is\nirrelevant, as is the fact that the appellants subjectively believed\nthat the\nfarms were on the same land, understandable though this\nbelief  may have been.\n[16]\tThe burial right in s 6(2)(dA) of the Act  is an\nincidence of the right of residence contained in s 6(1), which\ncreates a real\nright in land. Such a right is in principle\nregistrable in a Deeds Registry because it constitutes a âburden on\nthe landâ by\nreducing the ownerâs right of ownership of the land\nand binds successors in title.\n6\nThe burial right is in the nature of a personal servitude which the\noccupier has over the property on which he possesses a real right\nof\nresidence at death of a family member who at the time of death was\nresiding on the land.  These rights are claimable against the\nowners\nof registered land only.  And the only objective determination of the\nextent of the land which has been registered by an owner\nis by\nreference to its cadastral description.\n[17]\tIt follows that the court\na\nquo\nwas correct in its view that Bockenhoud\nand Sandspruit are separate pieces of âlandâ for the purposes of\nthe Act. Accordingly\nthe appellants have not established a right to\nbury the deceased on Bockenhoud.\n[18\n]\tIn regard to the second issue,\nwhether it was proved that it was in accordance with the appellantsâ\nreligious and cultural belief\nfor the deceased to be buried on\nSandspruit, the court\na quo\nheld that no such case was made out in the papers as the Dlaminiâs\nwere buried at the gravesite on Bockenhoud, not Sandspruit.\nAnd, so\nthat court reasoned, even though the practice was established for\nother families on Sandspruit, the appellants could not\nrely on that\nestablished practice in respect of the deceased.\n[19]\tIn so deciding the court\na\nquo\nerroneously interpreted s 6(2)(dA) to\nrequire the established practice to relate to a particular family\nwhereas the section clearly\nlinks the âestablished practiceâ to\nâpeople residing on the landâ. It is not confined to particular\nfamilies. The respondents\nwere therefore correct in conceding that\nthe court\na quoâs\ninterpretation of the section is wrong.\n[20]\tNevertheless, they persisted with the submission\nthat the case made out in the appellantsâ papers is that the\ndeceased must\nbe buried at the site on Bockenhoud where the Dlamini\nancestors are buried, and not Sandspruit. I am unable to agree with\nthis contention.\n[21]\tThe appellantsâ case is that it is a religious or\ncultural belief that deceased members of their family must be buried\nclose\nto their homestead so that the spirits of their ancestors might\nbe close to them.\n7\nThis belief is set out expressly in the first appellantâs founding\naffidavit where he states:\nâ\nIt was and is extremely important to my late wife and\nI that we were entitled to bury our deceased family members near our\nhome on\nthe farm, as it is a cultural imperative for us that our\nancestors and our family members are buried close to our home.\nâ\nThis the respondents admitted. Since the Sandspruit\nburial site is closer to the appellantsâ homestead than the\nBockenhoud site,\nthe requirement has clearly been met.\n[22]\tI turn to the third and final issue, whether an\nowner is entitled to terminate an established practice unilaterally\nas Andre\npurported to do in July 2002. The respondents contended that\nbecause an established practice can come into existence only after\nthe\nowner or person in charge has routinely given permission for\nburials to take place on the property, it follows that such\npermission\nmay be withdrawn by the owner. Put another way, the\ncontention was that the granting of permission, being a unilateral\nact on the\npart of the owner, may likewise be unilaterally\nterminated.\n[23]\tPrior to the introduction of s 6(2)(dA), landowners\nwere not obliged to permit occupiers to have further graves on their\nland\nupon request. The law as stated by this court in\nNkosi\nand another v BÃ¼hrmann\n2002 (1) SA 372\n,\n(SCA) at 389A-B was that:\nâ\n(D)espite the recognition in s (6)(4) of the sanctity\nof existing family graves and despite the reduction of the rights of\nownership\nto the extent demanded by the exercise of the rights\nconferred in s 6, the Legislature stopped short of obliging owners to\naccept\nagainst their will the creation of further graves. Had it been\nthe Legislatureâs intention to impose that burden by granting\noccupiers\nthe corresponding right it would not have occasioned any\nreal drafting problem to say so expressly. It is improbable that the\ncreation\nof that right was left to a matter of obscure inference.\nâ\n[24]\tThe Legislature introduced s 6(2)(dA) to deal with\nthis lacuna by âobliging owners to accept against their will the\ncreation\nof further gravesâ. The obligation however only arises if\nthe owner has routinely granted permission for burials, resulting in\nan established practice. But once a practice has been established, a\nright is conferred on an occupier to bury a deceased family\nmember\nwho, at the time of that personâs death, as is the case in the\ninstant matter, was residing on the land on which the occupier\nwas\nresiding. The respondents cannot be correct that such a right may be\nwithdrawn unilaterally, because, if this were so, the entire\npurpose\nof the amendment would be rendered nugatory.\n[25]\tAs mentioned earlier, the Act grants to an occupier\na real right in land that belongs to another person. And the right of\nan\noccupier to bury a deceased family member on such land is an\nincidence of this right. The withdrawal of consent by an owner for an\noccupier to bury a deceased family member is therefore an unlawful\ndeprivation of this right.\n[26]\tIt follows that once it is accepted that an\nestablished practice to bury deceased persons on Sandspruit came into\nexistence,\nand I do not understand the respondents to contend\notherwise, the appellants were entitled to bury the deceased there.\n[27]\tThe court\na quo\nmade no costs order and\nneither\nparty sought any costs in this court. In the result the appeal is\nupheld and the order of the court\na quo\namended accordingly. The following order is made:\n(i)\tThe appeal succeeds.\n(ii)\tThe order of the court below is set aside and\nsubstituted with the following:\nIt is declared that the applicants are entitled, in\nterms of\nsection 6(2)(dA)\nof the\nExtension of Security of Tenure Act\n62 of 1997\nto bury the body of Gertrude Ntombi Zondi in the burial\nsite on the remainder of the farm Sandspruit No. 1920.\n_­­_______________________\nA CACHALIA\nACTING JUDGE OF APPEAL\nConcur:\tHarms JA\nStreicher JA\nJafta JA\nMlambo Ja\n1\nThe appellants, in addition relied on section\n\t6(5) of the Act, but eschewed any reliance thereon in this appeal.\n\tIn the founding\npapers the first appellant also made out a case that\n\the was a labour tenant in terms of the Land Reform (Labour Tenants)\n\tAct 3\nof 1996. However as there were material disputes of fact the\n\tappellants did not pursue this cause of action in the LCC. In the\n\ncircumstances the appellants did not persist with that case in the\n\tLCC.\n2\nInserted by s 7(a) of Act 51 of 2001.\n3\nSection 1 of the Act Provides\nDefinition\nââ¦\nâ\noccupierâ\n\tmeans a person residing on land which belongs to another person, and\n\twho has on 4 February 1997 or thereafter had consent\nor another\n\tright in law to do so, but excludingâ\nâ¦\nâ\nownerâ\n\tmeans the owner of the land at the time of the relevant act,\n\tomission or conduct, and includes, in relation to the proposed\n\ttermination of a right of residence by a holder of mineral rights,\n\tsuch holder in so far as such holder in by law entitled to grant\nor\n\tterminate a right of residence or any associated rights in respect\n\tof such land, or to evict a person occupying such land.â\n4\nThe application may be made in terms of s 20(3)\n\tof the KwaZulu-Natal Cemetries Act, 12 of 1996.\n5\nChapter III (sections 5 â 7) sets out the\n\tâRights and Duties of Occupiers and Owners.â\n6\nSection 24(1) of the Act provides that âThe\n\trights of an occupier shall, subject to the provisions of this Act,\n\tbe binding on\na successor in title of an owner or person in charge\n\tof the land concernedâ.

    "facts": "The appellants, the husband and son of the deceased Gertrude Ntombi Zondi, sought to bury her at the Dlamini family burial site on the farm Bockenhoud Fontein, or alternatively on the farm Sandspruit. The farms Bockenhoud, Sandspruit and Mount Elias are owned by members of the Joosten family and are registered as separate parcels of land. Historically the Joostens had allowed various families, including the Dlaminis, to bury their dead on both Bockenhoud and Sandspruit. In July 2002 the owner of Sandspruit, Andre Joosten, announced that the practice of allowing burials on that farm would cease. When the deceased died in June 2004, Philip Joosten, then temporarily in charge of the farm, refused permission for a burial on Sandspruit, prompting the appeal. The lower court (Land Claims Court) had refused the burial on Bockenhoud and the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal.",
    "issues": "Three issues were before the court: (i) whether the term \"land\" in section 6(2)(dA) of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act is limited to the cadastral description of a registered parcel, thereby excluding Bockenhoud for the burial; (ii) whether the appellants proved that burial on Sandspruit was in accordance with their religious and cultural beliefs; and (iii) whether the respondents could unilaterally terminate an established burial practice once it had arisen.",
    "principles": "The court applied the definition of \"established practice\" in the Act, requiring routine permission by the owner or person in charge. It held that \"land\" refers to land registered in the deeds registry, as the Act regulates the relationship between occupier and owner of the same registered land. The burial right under s 6(2)(dA) is an incidence of the right of residence in s 6(1) and constitutes a personal servitude that binds successors. Pre‑Act case law (Nkosi v Bührmann) was cited to show that the legislature deliberately imposed an obligation on owners to accept further graves only where an established practice existed, and that such a right cannot be withdrawn unilaterally.",
    "application": "The court found that Bockenhoud and Sandspruit are separate cadastral parcels; therefore the appellants could not rely on the burial right for Bockenhoud where the deceased resided at the time of death on Sandspruit. However, the court recognized that an established practice of allowing burials on Sandspruit existed for various families, and that the appellants’ cultural belief required burials close to their homestead, which was satisfied by the Sandspruit site. Accordingly, the respondents could not withdraw the right once the practice was established, as that would defeat the purpose of the amendment.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The judgment of the lower court was set aside and replaced with a declaration that the appellants are entitled, under section 6(2)(dA) of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 62 of 1997, to bury the body of Gertrude Ntombi Zondi in the burial site on the remainder of farm Sandspruit No. 1920."
