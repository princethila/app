Since the\ngranting of such leave the appellant has died but for ease of reference I shall\nstill refer to him as the appellant.\nAfter the granting of special leave it came\nto light that the appellant had been sequestrated before the court\na quo\nheard the appeal. As a result the respondent now applies for the appeal to be\ndismissed. The trustee in the appellant’s insolvent\nestate wants to oppose\nthe application and applies to be substituted for the appellant.\n[2]\tDuring\nAugust 1999 the appellant entered into an agreement (‘the\nagreement’) with the respondent in terms of which\nthe appellant purchased\nfrom the respondent its claims against Kharbai Motors (Pty ) Ltd (in\nliquidation) (‘Kharbai Motors’)\nand Mohammed Carrim Kharbai\n(‘Kharbai’) against whom a provisional sequestration order had been\ngranted at the instance\nof the respondent. The respondent undertook to apply for\nthe discharge of the provisional sequestration order against Kharbai upon\npayment of two instalments in respect of the purchase price; to cede to the\nappellant the claims as well as two bonds registered\nin favour of the respondent\nas security in respect of the claims, upon payment of the purchase price in\nfull; and ‘to close\nthe enquiry into the affairs of Kharbai Motors under\nSection 415 of the Companies Act’.\n[3]\tThe appellant paid the full\npurchase price whereupon the respondent cancelled the mortgage bonds and sent\nthe relevant title deeds\nto the appellant’s attorneys. Approximately eight\nmonths later the appellant’s attorneys, in a letter to the\nrespondent’s\nattorneys, stated that, in terms of the agreement, the\nrespondent was obliged to cede its securities over the fixed properties to\nthe\nappellant. They indicated, furthermore, that they would gladly receive a reply\nas to the reasons why the respondent had cancelled\nthe mortgage bonds. The\nrespondent’s attorneys replied as follows:\n‘1.\tThank you for your\nletter of the 11\nth\nOctober.\n2.\tYou have been aware that the bonds have been cancelled since March this\nyear.\n3.\tThe bonds were cancelled with your client’s full knowledge and consent\nin view of the fact that he had advised that the\nproperties had been\nsold.’\n[4]\tShortly thereafter the appellant launched an\napplication against the respondent in terms of which he purported to cancel the\nagreement\nand sought an order against the respondent for the payment of\nR550 000, being the purchase price paid in terms of the agreement,\nplus\ninterest. He alleged that he never consented to the cancellation of the mortgage\nbonds and that he had not waived his rights\nin terms of the agreement, which\nprovided as follows:\n‘No variation or amendment of, addition to,\ndeletion from or consensual cancellation of this agreement or any of its terms\nor\nwaiver of any term of this agreement or waiver of any right which may accrue\nto either party by virtue of this agreement or the waiver\nof any right which may\naccrue to either party by virtue of the breach or termination of this agreement\nshall be effective unless\nin writing and signed by the\nparties.’\n[5]\tThe respondent defended the matter and alleged that it\nhad been agreed in writing that the mortgage bonds be cancelled. In this\nregard\nthe respondent relied on several letters written by the appellant on the\nletterhead of Louis Trichardt Wholesalers and signed\nby the appellant above the\nwords:\n‘FOR: LOUIS TRICHARDT WHOLESALERS\nMR Y O ABOO.’\nThe\nrespondent also relied on a note enclosing the deposit slip in respect of the\nappellant’s payment of the costs in respect\nof the cancellation of the\nbonds, signed ‘Mr Joe Aboo’. In his replying affidavit the appellant\nalleged that his signature\non the correspondence purported to be on behalf of\nLouis Trichardt Wholesalers.\n[6]\tThe application came before De Jager AJ. He\nreferred to the correspondence relied upon by the respondent; held that the\nagreement\nhad been amended in writing signed by the parties or their authorized\nagents; and dismissed the application. On 11 November 2002\nhe granted the\nappellant leave to appeal to the court\na quo\n.\n[7]\tOn 20 May 2003 a\nprovisional sequestration order, which was made final on 17 June 2003, was\ngranted against the appellant. The\nappellant nevertheless proceeded with the\nappeal without informing the court or the respondent that he had been\nsequestrated. The\nappeal was heard by the court\na quo\non 22 October 2003\nand was dismissed on or about 9 February 2004. Bertelsman J dissented. He held\nthat the appellant signed the letters\non behalf of Louis Trichardt Wholesalers,\na company, and that the agreement had therefore not been amended in writing\nsigned by the\nappellant, as required by the agreement.\n[8]\tThe appellant\nthereupon applied to this court for special leave to appeal, again without\ndisclosing that he was an unrehabilitated\ninsolvent. Leave to appeal was granted\nand the matter was eventually set down for hearing on 7 March 2005.\n[9]\tOn 3\nDecember 2004 the respondent’s attorneys wrote to the appellant’s\nattorneys that it had come to their attention\nthat the appellant had been\nsequestrated. They required the appellant’s attorneys to state on what\nbasis it was averred that\nthey were entitled to proceed, firstly with the appeal\nto the court\na quo\nand secondly with the application for leave to appeal\nand the appeal to this court. The appellant’s attorneys replied that\nthey\nhad not been aware that the appellant had been sequestrated but that the\nappellant died on 3 November 2004 and that they had\nbeen instructed by the\nappellant’s son, as executor in his estate, to proceed with the\nmatter.\n[10]\tApparently the appellant’s attorneys had second thoughts\nand on 14 February 2005 they wrote to the registrar of this\ncourt:\n‘Kindly note that the Appellant does not intend to proceed with\nthis matter on the date allocated.\nPlease inform the Judges that they are not\nrequired to read the record.\nThe appellant will carefully consider its\nposition.’\n[11]\tThis letter gave rise to an application by the\nrespondent for the dismissal of the appeal with costs against any party opposing\nthe application. The application in turn gave rise to an application by the\ntrustee in the insolvent estate of the appellant to be\nsubstituted for the\nappellant.\n[12]\tIn terms of\ns 20(1)(a)\nof the\nInsolvency Act 24 of 1936\nthe effect of the sequestration of the estate of an insolvent is to divest the\ninsolvent of his estate, to vest it in a Master of\nthe Supreme Court until a\ntrustee is appointed and upon the appointment of a trustee to vest the estate in\nhim. It follows that,\nafter the sequestration of the appellant, the right that\nhe acquired to appeal against the judgment of De Jager AJ no longer vested\nin\nhim but vested first in the Master and upon the appointment of a trustee in his\ntrustee. The appellant therefore had no right\nto proceed with the appeal to the\ncourt\na quo\nand with a further appeal appeal to this court.\n[13]\tThe\ntrustee states in his affidavit filed in support of the application to be\nsubstituted for the appellant, that he ratifies\n‘whatever steps had  been\ntaken by Mr Zehir Omar [the attorney who acted for the appellant] on behalf of\nthe insolvent and\nconsequently on behalf of the insolvent estate’.\nHowever, there is no evidence that any steps had been taken by Omar on behalf\nof\nthe insolvent estate. According to Mr Omar, who appeared for the trustee before\nus, he was unaware of the fact that the appellant\nwas insolvent. It must follow\nthat he could never have intended to act on behalf of his insolvent estate. On\nthe evidence before\nus, the appellant acted in his personal capacity and Omar\nrepresented him in that capacity. In these circumstances, assuming that\nthe\nsteps taken by the appellant could be ratified had he been acting on behalf of\nthe insolvent estate, a question that need not\nbe decided, there can be no\nquestion of the appeal being salvaged by way of ratification (see\nCaterers\nLtd v Bell and Anders\n1915 AD 698\nat 710).\n[14]\tBefore us Mr Omar relied\nheavily on\nDe Polo v Dreyer\n1991 (2) SA 164\n(W). In that matter an\ninsolvent instituted action for the payment of certain benefits to which his\ninsolvent estate was entitled.\nThe defendants filed a special plea in which they\ncontended that the insolvent was not legally entitled to institute and/or\nproceed\nwith the action. In his replication the insolvent alleged that his\ntrustee had waived his right to be joined. The alleged waiver\nby the trustee was\ninterpreted by the court as a refusal to institute action and an authorization\nto the insolvent to carry on with\nthe\naction.\n[1]\nMorris AJ held that the\ninsolvent could not sue for his own benefit but that the trustee’s refusal\nto do so entitled him to\nsue for the benefit of the insolvent\nestate.\n[2]\nIn the light of the fact\nthat the refusal occurred after the action had been instituted, Morris AJ held\nthat the insolvent’s\nlack of\nlocus standi\nhad retroactively been\nremedied and dismissed the special plea on the basis that there would be an\nappropriate amendment of the particulars\nof claim and the citation of the\ninsolvent.\n[3]\n[15]\tThe\nDe\nPolo\ncase is of no assistance to the trustee. In that case the court allowed\nthe insolvent’s lack of\nlocus standi\nto be cured retrospectively\nbut before judgment. Here a judgment has been given against the insolvent acting\non his own behalf. We\nare dealing with an appeal against that judgment and an\napplication by the trustee to be substituted for the appellant as appellant.\nThe\nlatter did not have the right to prosecute the appeal to the court\na quo\nand could clearly not seek from this court an order, in substitution of the\norder granted by the court\na quo\n, which he was not entitled to seek from\nthat court. It is equally clear that the trustee, if substituted for the\nappellant, cannot\ncontend that the appellant acting on his own behalf as he did,\nshould have succeeded in the court\na quo\n. It follows that a substitution\nof the trustee for the appellant can serve no purpose. The judgment, having been\ngranted in the absence\nof the trustee and without notice to him, could not\naffect his rights adversely. Should he still wish to prosecute the appeal\nagainst\nthe judgment of De Jager AJ his remedy is not to be substituted for the\nappellant in the appeal before us but to apply to the Transvaal\nProvincial\nDivision for the setting aside of the judgment of the court\na quo\nand to\nbe substituted for the appellant. For these reasons the application by the\ntrustee to be substituted for the appellant in\nthe appeal before us must be\ndismissed.\n[16]\tThe respondent applies for the appeal itself to be dismissed.\nHowever, in the light of the fact that the appellant died and that\nhis executor\nhas not been substituted for him, an order binding the executor cannot be made.\nThe appeal should, therefore, simply\nbe struck from the roll.\n[17]\tThe\nfollowing order is made:\n1\tThe application for substitution, as appellant, of the trustee in the\ninsolvent estate of the appellant, is dismissed with costs.\n2\tThe\nappeal is struck from the roll.\n___________________\nP E STREICHER\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\nCAMERON JA)\nNAVSA JA)\nHEHER JA)\tCONCUR\nCOMRIE\nAJA)\n[1]\nAt\n177F-G.\n[2]\nAt\n179D-F.\n[3]\nAt 179F-J.",

    "facts": "Yusuf Omar Aboo entered into an agreement with Firstrand Bank Limited in August 1999 to purchase the bank's claims against Kharbai Motors (Pty) Ltd and Mohammed Carrim Kharbai. Aboo paid the full purchase price and the bank cancelled the mortgage bonds over the secured properties, sending title deeds to Aboo's attorneys. Aboo later sued the bank, alleging the bonds were cancelled without his consent and that the agreement had not been validly varied in writing. The court a quo dismissed Aboo's claim, holding the bonds had been cancelled by written agreement. Aboo appealed, but before the appeal was heard he was sequestrated (declared insolvent) in May 2003, a fact he failed to disclose. He died in November 2004. The respondent sought dismissal of the appeal, and the trustee of Aboo's insolvent estate applied to be substituted as appellant.",
    "issues": "1. Whether a sequestrated (and later deceased) appellant retains the right to prosecute an appeal filed before sequestration. 2. Whether the trustee of the insolvent estate may be substituted for the appellant to continue the appeal. 3. Whether the substitution would have any legal effect on the appeal already decided by the court a quo.",
    "principles": "The court applied s 20(1)(a) of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936, which divests an insolvent of his estate upon sequestration, vesting it in the Master and subsequently in a trustee. Consequently, any right to appeal vested in the insolvent ceases and passes to the trustee. The trustee may only act where the original proceeding is still pending; a judgment already rendered cannot be attacked by a substituted party without a separate application to set aside that judgment. Precedent includes Caterers Ltd v Bell and Anders (1915 AD 698) on the futility of ratifying actions taken personally, and De Polo v Dreyer, which was distinguished because the remedy sought there was to cure lack of locus standi before judgment, not after.",
    "application": "The court found that Aboo's right to appeal was extinguished by his sequestration, and his death further prevented any personal continuation of the matter. The trustee could not step into Aboo's shoes for an appeal that had already been decided, as the judgment was rendered without the trustee’s participation and could not adversely affect his rights. Accordingly, the trustee's application for substitution was dismissed as having no legal purpose. The respondent’s application to dismiss the appeal was accepted, with the appeal being struck from the roll.",
    "conclusion": "The application for substitution of the trustee as appellant was dismissed with costs, and the appeal was struck from the roll."
