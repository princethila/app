The court\na quo\n(Joffe J) found the statements forming the basis of\nthe claim to be defamatory in two respects, and awarded damages in the sum of\nR50 000.\n[2]\tThe first appellant is the National Education, Health and Allied Workers\nUnion (‘NEHAWU’), a registered trade union.\nIt has members who are\nemployed at the Johannesburg Magistrates’ Court. It was sued on the basis\nthat it was vicariously liable\nfor defamatory statements made by its branch\nsecretary, the second appellant, a senior interpreter at that court. The\nrespondent\nis an advocate employed there as the manageress. Her duties entailed,\namong other things, dealing with labour matters. She had had\nvarious clashes\nwith NEHAWU from the time of her appointment in February 2002.\n[3]\tOn 28 June 2002 NEHAWU held a general meeting of its members at the\ncourt. The second appellant prepared a report which was distributed\nto members\nin attendance at the meeting. Later on certain staff members who were not\nmembers of NEHAWU (including the plaintiff and\none Mr Molefe) received copies of\nthe report. For the most part the report dealt with matters relating to labour\nrelations (eg outstanding\ndisciplinary matters, training issues, unilateral\nmanagement decisions). These had formed the subject of protracted and intense\nexchanges\nand negotiations between management and NEHAWU. Even though the\nstatements were   found to be defamatory in only two respects, it\nis useful to\nset out the full text of the portions against which complaint was made:\n(a) ‘The management headed by Ms Tsatsi is refusing to give us their\nplan, saying that it is privilege[d] information and it\ncannot be given to us.\nHow strange ?’\n(b) ‘Empty promises under the leadership of Ms Tsatsi has been made in\norder to expedite the training process or else to have\nan independent person to\ncome and tell the management that their kind of practice is cleft as\n“Residual Unfair Labour Practice”\nwe declared also another dispute\nin this regard; the administration of the office is in bad shape than that in\nthe era of Mr Bashe.\nIf you compare the present dispensation with that of Mr\nBashe, one can safely say Mr Bashe was doing very well in rooting out corrupt\nofficials instead of\nembracing them (fraudsters)\n.\n(c) ‘There is\nunprecedented harassment unleashed\nagainst General\nAssistants, Casual Interpreters, Permanent Interpreters, Stenographers and\nAdministration.  Literally the whole office\nis under siege since the arrival of\nthe new office manager.’\n(Emphasis added.)\n[4]\tThe plaintiff contended that the report was widely distributed by the\nsecond appellant, that the statements italicised were defamatory\nof her in that\nthey imputed, and were intended by the appellants to impute and were  \nunderstood by persons to whom they were distributed\nto mean that she is a liar,\nfraudster who connives with fraudsters, is corrupt, without moral fibre, is\ndishonest, and intimidated\nand harassed employees at the court. She pleaded\nfurther that the statements also carried the additional sting that she is\nmanipulative,\nvindictive and abused her power.\n[5]\tThe appellants denied that the statements were defamatory and, pleaded,\nalternatively, that they were protected by qualified privilege.\n[6]\tApart from the quantum, the issues at the hearing narrowed down to the\nfollowing:\n(a)\twhether the statements were defamatory ;\n(b)\tif so, whether they were protected by qualified privilege ; and\n(c)\twhether the appellants were liable for the re-publication of the report\noutside NEHAWU’s general meeting.\n[7]\tThe learned judge\na quo\nheld that the statements were defamatory.\nHe concluded that qualified privilege did not cover the publication to\nindividuals who\nwere not members of NEHAWU, and that the appellants were liable\nas they had failed to take steps to preclude the further publication\nof the\nreport. With the leave of this court the appellants appeal against that order.\nI deal with the issues in turn.\n[8]\tThe test whether the statements are defamatory is an objective one -\nwhether the statements complained of tend to lower the plaintiff\nin the\nestimation of the ordinary reader of the report. As was stated in\nJohnson v\nBeckett and another\n[1991] ZASCA 175\n;\n1992 (1) SA 762\n(A) at 773C-E a court,-\n‘construes the words in their context, and considers what meaning they\nwould convey to ordinary reasonable persons, having regard\nto the sort of people\nto whom the words  were or were likely to be published . . . “the average\nordinary reader of that newspaper”;.\n. . . The kind and quality of the\nreadership is relevant, since it is as much part of the context in which the\nalleged defamation\noccurs as the other words contained in the article\nare.’\n[9]\tThe words that the plaintiff ‘embraces fraudsters’ and\n‘unleashes unprecedented harassment’ against staff\nmembers are, it\nwould seem, used not only figuratively but also in hyperbole. To say of a person\nthat she embraces fraudsters suggests,\nin my view, that she colludes with and/or\ncondones fraudsters’ activities which in itself tarnishes the person and\ndiscredits\nher in her social and professional standing. Whether the same may be\nsaid of the accusation that a person, in a managerial position\nas is the\nplaintiff, ‘harasses’ staff is questionable. I would however add\nthat, given the content and the tone of the\nreport, any such defamation was\nslight.\n[10]\tHaving so found, the next question for consideration is whether the\nstatements were protected by qualified privilege. When making\nthe assessment it\nis convenient to deal, first, with the publication of the report at the meeting\nand, second, with re-publication\noutside the meeting. It is not in dispute that\nthe second appellant disseminated the report to the members of NEHAWU present at\nthe\nmeeting. To establish privilege the appellants were required to show that\nthe second appellant and NEHAWU members had a reciprocal\nright and duty to make\nand receive the report and the defamatory statements were relevant or germane\nand reasonably appropriate to\nthe\noccasion.\n[1]\nThe immunity would be\nforfeited if it is established that the second appellant acted with an improper\nmotive,\nbut that does not arise here because it was not raised as an issue\non the   pleadings.\n[11]\tOne of the recognised occasions that enjoys the benefit of the defence\nis an occasion where the statements were published in\nthe discharge of a duty or\nexercise of a right. The facts in this case illuminate the instrumental function\nof freedom of expression\nin labour relations. O’Regan\nJ\n[2]\nhas pointed out, regarding trade\nunions, that ‘[t]he Constitution recognises that individuals in our\nsociety need to be able\nto hear, form and express opinions and views freely on a\nwide range of matters’. She\nstated\n[3]\nthat-\n‘As Mokgoro J observed in\nCase and Another v Minister of Safety and\nSecurity and Others; Curtis v Minister of Safety and Security and Others\n[1996] ZACC 7\n;\n1996 (3) SA 617\n(CC) ... in para [27], freedom of expression is one of a\n‘web of mutually supporting rights’ in the Constitution. It\nis\nclosely related to freedom of religion, belief and opinion (s 15), the right to\ndignity (s 10), as well as the right to freedom\nof association (s 18), the right\nto vote and to stand for public office (s 19) and the right to assembly (s 17).\nThese rights taken\ntogether protect the rights of individuals not only\nindividually to form and express opinions, of whatever nature, but to establish\nassociations and groups of like-minded people to foster and propagate such\nopinions. The rights implicitly recognise the importance,\nboth for a democratic\nsociety and for individuals personally, of the ability to form and express\nopinions, whether individually or\ncollectively, even where those views are\ncontroversial. The corollary of the freedom of expression and its related rights\nis tolerance\nby society of different views. Tolerance, of course, does not\nrequire approbation of a particular view. In essence, it requires the\nacceptance\nof the public airing of disagreements and the refusal to silence unpopular\nview.’\n[12]\tThe question whether the statements were relevant to the occasion\ninvolves essentially a value judgment. The correct approach\nis set out by\nSmalberger JA in\nVan der Berg v Coopers & Lybrandt Trust (Pty) Ltd and\nOthers\n[2000] ZASCA 77\n;\n2001 (2) SA 242\n(SCA). He\nstated\n[4]\nthat:\n‘the concept of relevance under discussion is, ...essentially a matter\nof reason and common sense, having its foundation in\nthe facts, circumstances\nand principles governing each particular case. The words of Schreiner JA in\nR\nv Matthews and Others\n1960 (1) SA 752\n(A) at 758A that “relevancy is\nbased upon a blend of logic and experience lying outside the law” have\nparticular application\nin a matter such as the present, even though they were\nsaid in the context of evidential relevance (cf Hoffmann and Zeffertt\nThe\nSouth African Law of Evidence\n4\nth\ned at 21). The assessment of\nwhether a defamatory statement was relevant to the occasion to which it relates\nis therefore essentially\na value judgment in respect of which there are guiding\nprinciples but which is not governed by hard and fast rules. And in arriving\nat\nthat judgment due weight must be given to all matters which can properly be\nregarded as bearing upon it.’\n[13]\tHere, the second appellant\n,\nas the branch secretary of NEHAWU\n,\nhad a right to make allegations and\nimpart the information concerned\nto NEHAWU members and that the latter had a reciprocal right to receive it. That\nright is underlined\nby the provisions of s\n23\n[5]\nof the Constitution.\n[14]\tThe appellants contended that the statements were relevant to the labour\nmatters in respect of which they had the right and duty\nto report to their\nmembers. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the statements were\nuntruthful and not relevant to the\nissues discussed at the meeting ‘to\nadvance any of their objective goals’. Their relevance cannot be disputed.\nIn any\nevent as Corbett JA\n[6]\nhas\nstated, the truthfulness or otherwise of the statements has no bearing on\nwhether they were germane to the occasion or not.\n[15]\tAs I have already indicated, the court\na quo\nrejected the defence\nof privilege on the basis that the publication was not limited to NEHAWU members\nthereby finding that the appellants\nre-published the statements to non members.\nThere is however no proof that the second appellant or any of the employees of\nNEHAWU\nwas directly responsible for such re-publication.\n[16]\tAs to whether the appellants were liable for the re-publication, there\ncan be no doubt that one or more of NEHAWU members present\nat the meeting might\nhave re-published the report to non-members (including the plaintiff and Mr\nMolefe). There is however no evidence\nto show that the appellants authorised or\nwere otherwise responsible for the re-publication of the report.  On that basis\nthey cannot\nbe held liable for the wrongs committed by their members without\ntheir authorisation. The court\na quo\nfound, however, that the appellants\nshould have taken steps to preclude the re-publication, thereby implying, first,\nthat they acted\nnegligently in failing to take steps to prevent such\nre-publication. It bears note that the plaintiffs claim was not based on\nnegligence.\nMoreover, the plaintiff has not shown what steps the appellants\nought to have taken or second, that they were vicariously liable\nfor the conduct\nof those who might have disseminated the statements – there is no evidence\nto suggest that a relationship of\nan employer – employee or principal\n– agent existed for the appellants to be held so liable. The finding by\nthe court\na quo is therefore, with respect, without legal basis and places an\nundue burden on the appellants. For these reasons the plaintiff’s\nclaim\nought to have been dismissed with costs.\n[17]\tIn the result the following order is made:\n(a)   The appeal is upheld with costs.\n(b)   The order of the court\na quo\nis set aside and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n“The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs.”\n________________\nNKABINDE AJA\nCONCUR:\nHARMS JA\nCAMERON JA\nNUGENT JA\nJAFTA\n[1]\nSee the authorities cited in\nFDJ Brand ‘\nDefamation\n’ 7 Lawsa  2 ed  para 250.\n[2]\nSouth African National\nDefence  Union v Minister of Defence and Another\n[1999] ZACC 7\n;\n1999 (4) SA 469\n(CC) at\n477 para [7].\nSee too s 23 of the Constitution.

    "facts": "The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (NEHAWU) held a general meeting at the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on 28 June 2002. The union's branch secretary, the second appellant, prepared a report that was distributed to union members at the meeting and subsequently to some non‑members, including the plaintiff, Ms Tsatsi, who is a manageress at the court. The report contained statements alleging that Ms Tsatsi \"embraces fraudsters\" and that she has \"unleashed unprecedented harassment\" against court staff. The plaintiff sued NEHAWU and the second appellant for defamation, claiming the statements imputed dishonesty, corruption and abuse of power. The High Court found the statements defamatory and awarded damages, which NEHAWU appealed.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised four primary issues: (1) whether the statements in the report were defamatory; (2) whether the defence of qualified privilege applied to the statements; (3) whether the appellants were liable for the re‑publication of the report to non‑members; and (4) whether the appellants could be held vicariously liable for the actions of union members who may have disseminated the report.",
    "principles": "Defamation is assessed objectively: a statement is defamatory if it would lower the plaintiff in the estimation of an ordinary reasonable reader. Qualified privilege may apply where the publisher has a reciprocal duty and right to make the communication and the recipient has a reciprocal right to receive it, provided the statements are relevant to the occasion and the publisher acts without improper motive. Relevance is a value judgment based on reason and common sense. Constitutional freedom of expression, especially in labour relations, supports the privilege defence. Vicarious liability requires a sufficient relationship (employer‑employee or principal‑agent) and cannot be imposed absent such a relationship. Negligence is not a basis for liability in a defamation claim unless expressly raised.",
    "application": "The court held that the statements were indeed defamatory, though only slightly, as they suggested collusion with fraudsters and harassment. The defence of qualified privilege was deemed applicable to the distribution of the report at the union meeting because the union had a duty and right to inform its members on labour matters. However, the privilege did not extend to copies sent to non‑members; the appellants had no control over that subsequent distribution and there was no evidence they authorised it. Consequently, they could not be held liable for the re‑publication. The court also found no employer‑employee or principal‑agent relationship that would render NEHAWU vicariously liable for the actions of individual members. The claim of negligence was irrelevant to the defamation claim.",
    "conclusion": "The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the appeal, set aside the lower court's order, and dismissed the plaintiff's claim with costs. The appellants were not held liable for the defamatory statements outside the scope of qualified privilege, nor were they vicariously liable for any subsequent dissemination."
