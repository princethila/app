There are two conflicting versions\nin this regard and the outcome of the appeal\ndepends on which of the two\nversions is to be believed, having regard to the probabilities. The plaintiff\nsued the defendant in the\nCape High Court for damages for alleged medical\nnegligence. At the commencement of the trial Yekiso J ordered a separation of\nthe\nissues in terms of rule 33(4), and subsequently dealt only with the question\nof negligence. The learned judge decided that issue\nin favour of the plaintiff\nand granted the defendant leave to appeal to this court.\n[2]\tThese are\nthe facts. On Monday 5 June 2000, the plaintiff was suffering from intense pain\nin his right leg. He consulted his general\npractitioner, Dr George Simons, who\nexamined him and then referred him to the defendant. The defendant saw him on\nTuesday 6 June\n2000 and upon examining him he suspected, as he put it, that the\npain was caused by a lack of, or poor, blood flow to the lower leg.\nOn Wednesday\n7 June, he did an angiogram on the plaintiff, which revealed that various\narteries in the right upper leg were occluded\n(blocked). From this he concluded\nthat the plaintiff had severe ischaemia, which required urgent surgical\nintervention (in the form\nof a bypass operation). On Thursday 8 June, he\nperformed an iliac bi-femoral bypass operation on the plaintiff.\n[3]\tOn\nWednesday 14 June 2000, the plaintiff, who says that he was still not pain free\nafter the vascular surgery, consulted a neurosurgeon,\nDr Kieck. Dr Kieck\ndiscovered that the plaintiff had disc degeneration at the L4/5 vertebrae which\nhad resulted in a prolapsed disc\nin that area. There is a dispute as to whether\nthis condition had occurred before or after the plaintiff’s visits to Dr\nSimons\nand the defendant. The back problem also required surgery, in the form of\na laminectomy. On Wednesday 21 June 2000 Dr Kieck did the\nback operation, which\nthe plaintiff says brought him instant relief. However, shortly after the back\nneuro-surgery, he began to exhibit\n(and, according to him, continues to exhibit)\nsymptoms of claudication (blockage of the arteries with resultant cramping) in\nthe\nleft leg. He alleges that the current claudication was caused by the\ndefendant’s surgical intervention.\n[4]\tThe central factual issue at\nthe trial was whether, when the plaintiff saw Dr Simons and the defendant, he\npresented with lower\nback pain, which radiated from the back of his leg upwards\ninto his buttock as a result of a recent fall and a ‘snap’\nin his\nback, as alleged by him, or pain in the right lower leg (in particular the right\nfoot), as alleged by the defendant (supported\nby Dr Simons) primarily arising\nfrom his vascular problem. The judge\na quo\nfound that the pain with which\nthe plaintiff presented was of neuralgic origin and not of vascular origin. In\nessence thus, the judge\nfound that the defendant had made an incorrect\ndiagnosis.\nIssues on appeal\n[5]\tOn appeal the principal issue\nis whether the defendant misdiagnosed the plaintiff’s problem as being\nprimarily of vascular\nrather than of neuralgic origin which, on the\nplaintiff’s case, was more urgent. Three other related issues were also\nraised:\nfirst, whether in examining the plaintiff and in allegedly missing the\nsymptoms indicative of neuralgic/back pain, the treatment\nof which should have\ntaken priority, the defendant acted as a reasonable vascular surgeon would have\ndone when faced with the symptoms\nwith which the plaintiff presented (of course\nif we find that on the probabilities the defendant did not miss a neuralgic\nproblem\nthis issue will fall away); secondly, whether the plaintiff gave\ninformed consent to the surgical procedure performed by the defendant,\nin the\nabsence of which consent such intervention would have amounted to an assault;\nthirdly, whether the plaintiff’s current\nclaudication in the left leg was\ncaused by the defendant’s surgical intervention. I discuss these issues in\nturn.\nDid the defendant make an incorrect diagnosis?\n[6]\tThe\ncase for an incorrect diagnosis is based primarily on the plaintiff’s\nevidence and on that of Professor D R De Villiers,\na vascular surgeon, who had\nalready retired by the time of the trial. Professor De Villiers told the court\nthat the pain which the\nplaintiff described as having experienced when he had\nconsulted the defendant signified a neurological rather than a vascular problem,\nand that he should then have been referred to a neuro-surgeon. He did not think\nthat the plaintiff had critical ischaemia, which\nhe described as a progression\nfrom intermittent claudication - ‘a lameness, a weakness, a pain, a cramp\nthat usually starts\nin the calf muscle and may extend upwards’- not\ndownwards - and which comes only with exercise. According to Professor De\nVilliers,\nintermittent claudication is not incapacitating and does not interfere\nwith a person’s everyday life. Claudication is only\nincapacitating and\nrequires surgical intervention when it progresses to critical ischaemia. The\nsymptom that signifies critical ischaemia\nis referred to as\n‘restpain’, and is not intermittent, but constant, extremely severe\nand maximal. It is constant because\nit involves the nerves and is limited to the\nfarthest part of the foot, which is the last body part that the blood supply\nreaches.\nRestpain indicates a fairly advanced stage of arterial disease. The\nworst form of critical ischaemia manifests itself in gangrene,\nat which stage\nthe vessels become completely blocked and the tissues die. Then, nothing can\ncome through and the leg becomes absolutely\nblack and dies. The only\n‘cure’ would be amputation. Although Professor De Villiers was\nsatisfied from what he was told\nthat the plaintiff had not reached the advanced\nstage of critical ischaemia, he conceded that, if the plaintiff exhibited\nrestpain\nat the time he consulted with Dr Simons and the defendant, then\nsurgical intervention was justified.\n[7]\nI turn to the\nplaintiff’s\nevidence. He told the court that, when he saw Dr Simons\non 5 June 2000, he complained of intense pain in the back of his right thigh,\nwhich shot up into his buttock. He also mentioned severe pain in the back and\nremarked: ‘my back is buggered’. Notwithstanding\nthis remark, Dr\nSimons ‘fiddled’ with his feet, which he considered to have nothing\nto do with the pain in the back.\n[8]\tDr Simons disputed the\nplaintiff’s version. He testified that the plaintiff had mentioned pain in\nthe lateral part of the\nright lower leg, which shot up to his buttock. The\nplaintiff told him that he had had this pain for some five days and made no\nmention\nof pain in the back. The plaintiff also told him of a back operation, a\nlaminectomy, which he had had, way back in 1972. Thinking\nthat the pain in the\nleg might be a recurrence of the old injury, Dr Simons decided to do a straight\nleg-raising test on both legs.\nThe test achieved a 70˚ raise, as a result\nof which he was satisfied that the plaintiff exhibited no neurological deficit.\nIn\nfact, in his report Dr Simons noted the absence of entrapment of the nerve.\nProfessor De Villiers conceded that the test carried\nout by Dr Simons was indeed\nthe normal test used to determine the presence or absence of neurological\ndeficit. Dr Simons also noted\nthat the plaintiff’s right foot was a little\ndifferent to the left. He felt pulses in the left foot but none in the right\nfoot.\nHe also felt pulses behind the left knee and up in the groin but found\nthat they were completely absent on the right side. Having\nin addition\nestablished that the plaintiff was a heavy smoker, smoking about 30 to 40\ncigarettes per day, he was satisfied that the\nplaintiff had definite ischaemia\nor lack of blood supply to the right leg. He advised the plaintiff that there\nwas an urgent need\nfor correction and that he wished to refer him urgently to a\nvascular surgeon, as he was extremely concerned with what appeared to\nbe a very\ngreatly diminished blood supply to the right leg. He feared that the plaintiff\nwas in danger of losing his leg and felt\nthat a decision had to be made\nurgently.\n[\n9\n]\nAs regards the defendant’s version, he\nhad - not surprisingly - no independent recollection of what was said during his\nconsultation\nwith the plaintiff on 6 and 7 June 2000. Since then he had seen\nmany other patients. He could therefore only meet the plaintiff’s\nversion\nby referring to how he routinely consulted with his patients and by referring as\nan\naide memoire\nto his records, which he had initially kept\nelectronically on computer, and which were replaced by a letter he sent to Dr\nSimons\non 26 June 2000. The letter records that the plaintiff presented with a\nfive day history of pain in the right leg and restpain of\nthe foot. The pain is\ndescribed as most marked over the peroneal compartment of the right lower leg.\nIt also records that, on examination,\nthe right foot was clearly ischaemic with\nblue discolouration and decreased temperature and that no pulse was felt in the\nright leg\nwhereas pulses were present in the left leg. Elaborating on his\nreport, the defendant testified that the plaintiff had complained\nof pain in the\nright leg which he said was most pronounced in the outer part of the lower leg,\njust above the ankle. He noticed that\nthe plaintiff limped into the examination\nroom and that his foot had a dusky, light bluish colour and was cool to the\ntouch. It was\nclear to him that the plaintiff had severe pain seeing that, as he\nwalked, he attempted to place as little weight as possible on\nthe right\nfoot.\n[10]\tThe defendant suggested that an angiogram be done to define\nthe severity and extent of the disease, on the basis of which he\ncould then\nrecommend corrective treatment. The angiogram revealed a much more severe\nsituation than the defendant had anticipated.\nNot only were the main vessels\nwhich supplied blood to the right leg blocked, but the other vessels which\nnormally provide alternate\nroutes were also blocked. The external right iliac\nartery - the vessel that normally takes the blood down the leg - was completely\nblocked off. Although there were also blockages on the left hand side, the\nplaintiff’s body had compensated adequately for\nthat deficit. There was\nsufficient blood getting to the left foot via collateral arteries, which acted\nas effective substitutes for\nthe arteries that were disabled by the blockage.\nThe angiogram confirmed the defendant’s earlier clinical suspicion of a\nvery\npoor blood flow to the right leg. In the light of this he diagnosed the\nplaintiff as having severe ischaemia. He considered that\nthe leg was under\nthreat and that the next stage, if the vascular problem was left uncorrected,\nwould be the setting in of gangrene,\nwith the consequent risk of amputation of\nthe lower leg. The defendant testified that if a leg did not receive blood it\nwas starved\nof nutrients which are essential for it to function. In the absence\nof nutrients, the leg would be jeopardised, which was the prospect\nfacing the\nplaintiff. The defendant considered that, if there were a minor injury to the\nleg, infection could set in and speed up\nthis process. He was of the view that\nthe plaintiff faced the real prospect of losing his leg and that something had\nto be done urgently.\n[11]\tThe defendant stated that he attempted to explain\nthe situation to the plaintiff in as understandable a manner as possible. He\nadvised the plaintiff that his vascular problem could be corrected by doing an\naorta-bi-femoral bypass, which entailed bypassing\nboth iliac systems (affected\nby blockages) and re-routing the blood along substitute tubing to the lower part\nof the leg which was\nnot getting adequate supply of blood. This suggested\nsurgical procedure turned out to be beyond the plaintiff’s financial\nmeans,\nhowever, as the hospital and clinic fees alone amounted to between R80\n000 and R90 000. Notwithstanding that the defendant was prepared\nto lower his\nfees, the aorta bi-femoral bypass surgical procedure was excluded as a viable\nfinancial option, as the hospital and\nthe clinic were not prepared to lower\ntheir charges.\n[12]\tThe defendant then suggested a cheaper, simpler and\nless risky surgical procedure, an iliac bi-femoral bypass, the cost of which\nwas\nin the region of R40 000. The plaintiff agreed to this procedure and the\noperation was done on 8 June 2000.\n[13]\nIn\ndeciding which\nof the two opposing versions is to be accepted, it is necessary to have regard\nfirst to what transpired at the consultation\nthe plaintiff had with Dr Simons\nand later with the defendant, in respect of the history given to them by the\nplaintiff and their\nclinical findings, assessed in the light of the\nprobabilities. The plaintiff’s version as to the pain with which he\npresented\nand which he described to Dr Simons and, later, to the defendant\n(namely the complaint concerning back pain) is totally divergent\nfrom and\nincompatible with the defendant’s version of ischaemic vascular disease of\nthe right lower leg and foot, with which\nhe says the plaintiff presented and\ndescribed to him. All the plaintiff’s experts were agreed that if, at the\ntime, the plaintiff\nhad back pain only and no pain in the lower leg and foot,\nthe plaintiff’s problem was of neuralgic origin.\n[14]\tIt seems to\nme that the issue for determination is whether the plaintiff, when he consulted\nthe defendant, suffered from a neuralgic\nor a vascular problem, and this is\nentirely dependent upon which factual version is to be accepted. If there was a\ndual pathology,\nthen we must determine whether the procedure followed by the\ndefendant was correct. The dispute thus involves a choice between the\nversion of\nthe plaintiff, on the one hand, and that of the defendant on the other,\nsupported by Dr Simons. Yekiso J\naccepted the plaintiff’s version\nin preference to that of Dr Simons and the defendant. Counsel for the plaintiff\nurged us to\nfollow suit and submitted, somewhat boldly it must be said, that the\njudgment of the court\na quo\nincludes findings of credibility with which\nthe appellate court will not normally interfere. We were not referred to any\nspecific\npassage in the judgment recording such credibility findings. I could\nnot find any. Indeed, it is not apparent from the record why\nthe version of Dr\nSimons and the defendant was rejected. On a proper approach, the choice or\npreference of one version over the other\nought to be preceded by an evaluation\nand assessment of the credibility of the relevant witnesses, their reliability\nand the probabilities.\n(See\nStellenbosch Farmers’ Winery Group Ltd\n& another v Martell Et Cie &\nothers\n[1]\n). Unfortunately it is\nnot apparent from the record that this approach was adopted by the judge\na\nquo\n. I do not think this is a case where, sitting as a court of appeal, we\nshould defer to the trial court’s findings of credibility\nbecause of the\npeculiar advantages it had of seeing and hearing the witnesses. Even if such\nfindings were in fact made by the trial\ncourt, I do not think that we are\nprecluded from dealing with findings of fact which do\nnot\nin essence\ndepend on personal impressions made by a witness in giving evidence, but are\nrather based predominantly upon inferences\nfrom the facts and upon the\nprobabilities. In\nUnion Spinning Mills (Pty) Ltd v Paltex Dye House (Pty) Ltd\n& another\n[2]\nthis court, per\nZulman JA, said:\n‘Although Courts of appeal are slow to disturb\nfindings of credibility they generally have greater liberty to do so where a\nfinding of fact does not essentially depend on the personal impression made by a\nwitness’s demeanour but predominantly upon\ninferences from other facts and\nupon probabilities. In such a case a Court of appeal with the benefit of an\noverall conspectus of\nthe full record may often be in a better position to draw\ninferences, particularly in regard to secondary\nfacts.’\n[15]\nIt follows therefore that the factual evidence\npresented to the court\na quo\nmerits reconsideration and re-evaluation. It\nseems to me that, if the plaintiff’s version regarding the history he gave\nto Dr\nSimons and the defendant is to be believed, the two doctors not only\nclinically missed his back problem, but deliberately chose to\nignore it,\nnotwithstanding that he had specifically mentioned it to them. This is in my\nview highly improbable. Furthermore, it is\ndifficult to see why the two doctors,\nconsulting the plaintiff individually and separately on different dates, would\nboth focus on\nthe right leg, in respect of which there was (on the\nplaintiff’s version) no complaint. There is yet another important feature.\nIs it merely a coincidence that the leg depicted on the angiogram happened to be\nthe leg that was in fact occluded? The picture revealed\nin the angiogram appears\nto support the diagnosis, made by both Dr Simons and the defendant, of a severe\nvascular problem in the\nright leg and contradicts the plaintiff’s\nassertion that he had no pain in the right foot or that there was nothing wrong\nwith\nhis right lower leg. The evidence that the plaintiff, when he saw Dr Simons\nand the defendant, complained of pain in the right lower\nleg (in particular the\nright foot) and not of pain in the back, and the defendant’s clinical\nfindings in this regard are supported\nby all objectively verifiable facts and\ncircumstances. Those include the earlier presentation to Dr Simons who, in broad\nterms, made\nsimilar findings to those of the defendant; the angiogram which\ndepicted a vascular condition with very little blood flow  to the\nright lower\nleg; the defendant’s letter to Dr Simons dictated some 3 weeks after the\noperation and from contemporaneous notes\nclearly confirming the\ndefendant’s version of events; and the clinical note made by Dr Kieck that\nthe plaintiff had told him\nabout pain in his right calf prior to his visit to\nthe defendant.\n[16]\tAs indicated above, Professor De Villiers conceded\nthat if, at the time, the plaintiff exhibited restpain, surgical intervention\nwas justified. In this regard the court had only the evidence of the plaintiff\nto be weighed against that of the defendant. The defendant\nnoted restpain in the\nletter he sent to Dr Simons. Dr Simons did not specifically mention the presence\nof restpain, a fact which\nmight to some extent be taken to support the\ncontention that vascular surgical intervention was not urgent. Dr Simons did,\nhowever,\ntestify that on examination he found the plaintiff’s right foot\nto be ‘a little different to the left’; he felt\nno pulses in the\nright foot, which to him suggested severe arterial disease. Dr Kieck did not\nnote restpain but made a note that\nthe plaintiff had told him about pain in his\nright calf prior to his visit to the defendant. The bits and pieces of evidence\nthat\nsupport the contention that there was no restpain at the time of the visits\nto Dr Simons and to the defendant pale into insignificance\nwhen one has regard\nto the evidence of the two doctors and the other supporting evidence. I think it\nis fair to accept that a general\npractitioner such as Dr Simons would not have\nwished or been able to do a more in-depth investigation than a specialist. That\nis\nwhy he referred the plaintiff to the defendant for further evaluation. His\nfailure expressly to mention restpain in his notes does\nnot mean that he missed\nit.\n[17]\tThe evidence of the plaintiff is riddled with other\ndifficulties. It is contradicted by the angiogram which demonstrated that\nhe had\na serious vascular problem notwithstanding his protestation that there was\nnothing wrong with his right lower leg. The plaintiff\nwas also contradicted by\nhis estranged wife, Ms Marlene Oldwage, who told the court during\ncross-examination that, when the defendant\nvisited Dr Simons, the pain in his\nback resulting from a fall in the Cederberg had long disappeared. She said at\nthat stage he complained\nof pain in the leg. There are also discrepancies\nbetween, on the one hand, the plaintiff’s evidence relating to exercise,\nand\nthat of his wife and his brother, Mr George Henry Oldwage, on the other. The\nevidence of the plaintiff’s wife and of his brother\nin this regard also\ndoes not tie up in several respects. The plaintiff testified that, before the\nvascular operation, he used to\ndo a lot of exercise in the form of walking,\nswimming and cycling. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he and his wife\nused to\ncycle after supper but his wife said they cycled before supper. Her\nevidence was that they used bikes belonging to the plaintiff,\nwhereas his\nbrother said that the bikes which the plaintiff and his wife used belonged to\nhim. The plaintiff’s brother said\nthat he had bought a bike for his\ngirlfriend and two for his children, and that the latter were the bikes that he\nlent to the plaintiff\nand his wife. At some stage the contradictions become\ncomical: the plaintiff’s wife said under oath that she and the plaintiff\nhad brought two bikes with them to the Cederberg and said: ‘O, ons het `n\nMercedes gehad, en agter die Mercedes was die ding\nwaar ons die fietse gesit\nhet’. To a further question in cross-examination, she replied that the\nplaintiff cycled on his own\nbike. At first glance these contradictions seem to\nbe minor. But when the plaintiff’s account of his exercising regime is\ncontrasted\nwith the expert medical evidence of Professor Immelman, Dr Stein and\nthe defendant, all supported by the angiogram, to the effect\nthat the state of\nthe plaintiff’s arterial disease was such that he could not do exercise to\nthe extent to which he claims\nhe did, the contradictions assume importance.\nThose small lies cumulatively make one question the truth of the\nplaintiff’s\nevidence. In particular, the claim by the plaintiff’s\nbrother that the plaintiff cycled some 50 kilometres up the mountain\npass is\ntotally discredited by the medical evidence. It seems to me that the evidence of\nthe plaintiff and his witnesses to the effect\nthat he engaged in such exercise\nbefore the defendant’s surgical intervention must be rejected as contrived\nand unworthy of\ncredence.\n[18]\tI also do not agree that the symptoms with\nwhich the plaintiff presented were neurological and related to his back, rather\nthan\nvascular. First, the plaintiff did not inform Dr Simons and the defendant\nthat he had slipped and injured his back in the Cederberg.\nI find the evidence\nof the doctors more reliable and persuasive than that of the plaintiff. It\ncannot be said that the defendant\nlied to the court in the version which he\npresented. Against this is the evidence of the plaintiff which is very\nunreliable. Furthermore,\nthe probabilities militate against the contention that\nDr Simons and the defendant missed and/or ignored the back pain which the\nplaintiff says he mentioned to them.\n[19]\tThere is yet another feature\nthat supports the version of Dr Simons and the defendant and contradicts that of\nthe plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff says he was not pain-free after the surgical\nprocedure performed by the defendant. In this regard he is contradicted\nby the\nhospital notes prepared by the nurses during his post-operation confinement,\nfrom which it appears that he did not complain\nof any pain. His explanation when\nconfronted with this in cross-examination, to the effect that he did not\ncomplain because he wanted\nto be discharged, is not at all convincing. Also, the\nplaintiff said that when Dr Simons visited him at home after the vascular\noperation,\nhe told the doctor that he was suffering from exactly the same pain\nthat he had before the operation. This was disputed by Dr Simons\nwho said that\nthe plaintiff mentioned pain in the back. Indeed, when he went to see Dr Kieck,\nthe neurologist, he was diagnosed as\nhaving a back problem for which he\nunderwent surgery on 21 June 2000, after he had told Dr Kieck of the incident in\nwhich he hurt\nhis back and of the back pain that shot down to the right leg. In\nmy view, this supports the version of Dr Simons, that when he visited\nthe\nplaintiff at home, the latter complained of pain in the back and casts serious\ndoubt on the plaintiff’s version in this\nregard. Furthermore, at the first\nconsultation, as I have already indicated, Dr Simons did a leg raise, achieving\na 70˚ elevation\nof both legs, from which he concluded that there was no\nnerve entrapment. Dr Kieck was only able to achieve a leg raise of 30˚\nin\nthe right leg. It is therefore clear that the symptoms with which the plaintiff\npresented to Dr Simons and to the defendant were\ndifferent to those with which\nhe presented to Dr Kieck. In my view, there is no basis for concluding that the\npain which the plaintiff\nhad when he went to see Dr Simons and the defendant\narose from a neurological problem. Accordingly, on all the evidence, the\ndefendant’s\nsurgical intervention was justified and there is no basis for\na finding of misdiagnosis. In\nMitchell v\nDixon\n[3]\nInnes ACJ said:\n‘A practitioner can only be held liable in this respect, if his\ndiagnosis is so palpably wrong as to prove negligence, that\nis to say, if his\nmistake is of such a nature as to imply absence of reasonable skill and care on\nhis part, regard being had to the\nordinary level of skill in the\nprofession.’\nIn the present matter it cannot be said that the\ndefendant was negligent or did not exercise the necessary care and skill\nrequired\nof him in making the diagnosis. I am saying this mindful of the fact\nthat the defendant was a specialist and that what is expected\nof him is the\nfollowing:\n‘A specialist is required to employ a higher degree of care\nand skill concerning matters within the field of his speciality\nthan a general\npractitioner. The objective “reasonable physician test” is\nsubjectified to the particular branch of medicine\nto which the specialist\nbelongs. This means that it is expected from a specialist in the treatment of\nhis patients to act as a reasonable\nspecialist would have done under similar\ncircumstances.’\n[4]\nOn all the\nevidence that is exactly what the defendant did. He examined the\nplaintiff’s problem in depth, subjected him to an\nangiogram and did what\nhe and other specialists, Professor Immelman and Dr Stein, considered to be an\nappropriate operation to treat\nthe plaintiff’s condition. In my view there\nis no basis for a finding of incorrect diagnosis.\nDid the defendant\nperform an incorrect surgical procedure?\n[20]\tAllied to the above\nquestion is the issue whether the defendant acted as a reasonable vascular\nsurgeon would have done when faced\nwith the symptoms with which the plaintiff\npresented, referred to in para 5 above. According to the plaintiff’s\nexpert witness,\nProfessor De Villiers, the defendant should have done an aorta\nbi-femoral bypass. The problem was that the plaintiff could not afford\nthat\nprocedure and, for that reason, the defendant suggested the iliac bi-femoral\nbypass, a simpler, cheaper and less risky - but\nby no means inferior - surgical\nprocedure. As regards the plaintiff’s lack of sufficient funds, Professor\nDe Villiers suggested\nthat the procedure could have been done at a public\nhospital. There was however overwhelming evidence from Professor Immelman that\nthis was not possible. He testified that the plaintiff might not have met the\nmeans test. Besides, there was a long waiting list\nand the plaintiff would not\nhave been permitted to jump the queue. If the defendant’s evidence of the\nplaintiff’s serious\narterial disease is anything to go by, his leg might\nwell have had to be amputated by the time his turn came. It seems to me that\non\nthe acceptable evidence the defendant acted reasonably in his treatment of the\nplaintiff. In any event the plaintiff would have\nbeen aware of the existence of\npublic hospitals but chose to consult a private practitioner who could perform\nan operation which\nwas appropriate and which cured the deficient blood supply to\nthe plaintiff’s lower right leg. In the circumstances even if\nthe\nplaintiff could have had the more expensive operation done at a public hospital\nthere was no duty on the defendant to refer him\nto such a hospital. What is\nreasonable in the circumstances was explained by Innes CJ in\nVan Wyk v\nLewis\n[5]\nwhere he\nsaid:\n‘...[in] deciding what is reasonable the Court will have regard\nto the general level of skill and diligence possessed and exercised\nat the time\nby the members of  the branch of the profession to which the practitioner\nbelongs.’\nOn the acceptable evidence there can be no question that the\nmethods used by the defendant to diagnose the plaintiff’s problem\nwere\nthose used in his profession and the surgical procedure he performed was the\ncorrect one. The plaintiff could not dispute this\nbut was driven to contend,\nrelying on the evidence of Professor De Villiers, that there had been a dual\npathology and that treatment\nof the vascular problem diagnosed by the defendant\nwas not urgent. On the evidence of Dr Simons and the defendant the dual\npathology\nhad not been presented to them. According to them the plaintiff\nexhibited a serious vascular disease and the angiogram confirmed\nthis. No\nmention was made of pain in the back. I accept their evidence. The views and the\nconclusion reached by Professor De Villiers\nsuggesting the presence of dual\npathology, at the time the plaintiff was seen by Dr Simons and the defendant,\nmust therefore be rejected.\nIt is true that in his letter to Dr Simons dated 26\nJune 2000 the defendant does allude to the possibility of dual pathology but\nin\nmy view that seems to be based on the fact that\nsubsequently\nthe\nplaintiff was found by Dr Kieck to have a neurological problem. It is by no\nmeans an admission that at the time he was seen by\nhimself and Dr Simons the\nplaintiff had both a vascular problem and a neurological problem.\nWas\nthere informed consent?\n[21]\tIn argument it was submitted that the\nplaintiff did not consent to the surgical procedure performed by the defendant\n(the iliac\nbi-femoral bypass). Counsel argued that the plaintiff did not know\nwhat procedure was performed. He drew attention to the consent\nform signed by\nthe plaintiff in which the operation was described as a ‘fem-fem\nbypass’ whereas an iliac bi-femoral bypass\nwas performed. There is no\nmerit in the argument. According to the defendant that is the general\nterminology used for the cross-over\nbypass whether it be an iliac bi-femoral or\na femoro-femoral bypass. Professor De Villiers testified that the difference was\nof semantic\ninterest only and that although the medical literature referred to\nthe femoro-femoral bypass everybody did the iliac-femoral bypass.\nThe defendant\nexplained in detail to the plaintiff the surgical procedure he planned to do and\nwhich was eventually done. In the\ncircumstances I am satisfied that the\nplaintiff gave informed consent to the operation. In any event Professor De\nVilliers conceded\nthat the iliac bi-femoral bypass or the cross-over bypass was\nsuperior to the femoro-femoral bypass, because of its advantages in\nfacilitating\na natural flow of blood to the extremities.\nWas the plaintiff warned\nof the risks involved and was his current claudication caused by the\ndefendant’s surgical intervention?\n[22\n]\nIt was argued that\nthe defendant had failed to warn the plaintiff of the risks at stake. In\nCastell v De Greef\n[6]\nAckermann J said:\n‘For consent to operate as a defence the\nfollowing requirements must,\ninter alia,\nbe satisfied:\n(a)\nthe consenting party\n“must have had knowledge and been aware of the nature and extent of the\nharm or risk”;\n(b)\nthe consenting party\n“must have appreciated and understood the nature and extent of the harm or\nrisk”;\n(c)\nthe consenting party\n“must have consented to the harm or assumed the\nrisk”;\n(d)\nthe consent “must be\ncomprehensive, that is extend to the entire transaction, inclusive of all its\nconsequences”.’\nRelying on\nCastell v\nDe Greef\nit\nwas argued that the defendant should have explained the\nlikelihood of claudication occurring as a result of the iliac bi-femoral bypass,\nthe so-called ‘small operation’. Professor De Villiers said that the\nclaudication which the plaintiff experienced on\nthe left leg is undoubtedly due\nto what is termed a ‘steal syndrome’, as evidenced by the fact that\nthe first time the\nplaintiff walked after his back operation, he had\nclaudication of the left leg. He said that the problem in the left leg relates\ndirectly to the vascular operation. For this view Professor De Villiers relied\non what he called Veteran Administration Studies (VA\nstudies). The results of\nthe study were published in 1976. It was then the largest study in the world of\npatients who had undergone\nthese extra-anatomical bypasses. The study was\nconducted on ex-war veterans from the Second World War and the wars in Korea and\nVietnam\nat the Veteran Administration Hospitals which were built across America.\nProfessor De Villiers said four per cent of these patients\ndemonstrated clinical\nmanifestations of ‘steal’ and that the defendant should have\nanticipated a four per cent possibility\nof ‘steal’. In simple lay\nterms what Professor De Villiers suggested was happening was that blood which\nwas meant to\nflow down the left leg was now being diverted to the right leg. He\nargued that the claudication was directly related to the smaller\noperation, that\nis the iliac bi-femoral bypass. He said that if a bigger operation, that is the\naorta bi-femoral bypass had been\ndone, the graft would have been taken down to\nthe knee level on the left and the plaintiff would not be having a problem. Of\ncourse\nthe evidence was that the latter operation could not have been done\nbecause the plaintiff could not afford it.\n[23]\tProfessor Immelman who\ngave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff said that there was only a two per cent\nchance of steal occurring\nwhere the smaller operation (the iliac bi-femoral\nbypass) was done. He said that the comparison made by Professor De Villiers and\nthe conclusion reached by him were simply not valid. To compare the situation as\nit was in the year 2000 with a study that was done\nin 1976 at a hospital which\nsimply did not have many of the tests available to a vascular surgeon today was\nunrealistic. So, for\nexample, in the cases referred to in the study, angiograms\nwere not performed to ascertain if there was stenosis (narrowing of the\nvessels), whereas the defendant\nhad\ndone the angiogram in the present\nmatter. Professor Immelman also pointed out that the war veteran hospitals where\nthese studies\nwere done were not well-equipped. He said the VA studies are not\nhighly regarded as scientific studies.\n[24]\tProfessor Immelman further\npointed out that what makes modern vascular procedure difficult to compare with\nthe VA studies is\nthat the veterans were a generally unhealthy lot. They smoke;\nthey drink; they are obese and they tend to have very extensive diseases.\nHe had\nseen them when he visited some of these hospitals when he was in the United\nStates. He did not consider it fair to compare\nthat group of patients with an\naverage patient in South Africa in the year 2000. He pointed out that, since\nthat study in 1976, technology\nand investigations have improved enormously and\nthe ‘steal’ percentage in cross-over by-passes, if it was four per\ncent\nin 1976, must now surely be a lot lower than that. As indicated he put the\nrisk of ‘steal’ as being no higher than two\nper\ncent.\n[25]\tThe reasons advanced by Professor Immelman appear to me to be\nso compelling that I have no hesitation in accepting them. If there\nwas only a\ntwo per cent chance of ‘steal’ occurring then the risk to the\nplaintiff was so negligible that it was not\nunreasonable for the defendant not\nto mention it. In\nRichter and another v Estate\nHammann\n[7]\na neuro-surgeon\nwas found not to have been negligent in failing to warn the patient where on the\nevidence there was only a remote\npossibility of complications arising. The court\nsaid that the doctor’s actions had to be tested by the standard of the\nreasonable\ndoctor faced with the particular problem. In this regard Watermeyer J\nsaid the following:\n‘A doctor whose advice is sought about an\noperation to which certain dangers are attached – and there are dangers\nattached\nto most operations – is in a dilemma. If he fails to disclose the\nrisks he may render himself liable to an action for assault,\nwhereas if he\ndiscloses them he might well frighten the patient into not having the operation\nwhen the doctor knows full well that\nit would be in the patient’s interest\nto have it. It may well be that in certain circumstances a doctor is negligent\nif he\nfails to warn a patient, and, if that is so, it seems to me in principle\nthat his conduct should be tested by the standard of the\nreasonable doctor faced\nwith the particular problem. In reaching a conclusion a Court should be guided\nby medical opinion as to what\na reasonable doctor, having regard to all the\ncircumstances of the particular case, should or should not do. The Court must,\nof course,\nmake up its own mind, but it will be assisted in doing so by medical\nevidence.’\nIn my view of the evidence, the likelihood of steal\noccurring, with the resultant claudication, was so negligible that no duty arose\non the defendant to mention it and his omission to do so did not constitute\nnegligence. In any event there is no evidence that the\nplaintiff’s current\nclaudication is due to ‘steal’ or that, if it is the result of\n‘steal’, it is due\nto the cross over bypass performed on the\nplaintiff. The evidence was that there are many causes of ‘steal’.\nPoor heart\nfunctioning is one of them. Professor Immelman said that if\n‘steal’ does occur, it can be rectified by a minor operation.\nFor\nthe above reasons it was not in my view shown that there was an absence of\ninformed consent or that the claudication was due\nto the defendant’s\nsurgical intervention.\nExpert evidence and how it was dealt with at\nthe trial.\n[26]\tIt is perhaps appropriate at this stage to touch on how\nthe expert evidence was dealt with by the judge\na quo\nin coming to his\nconclusion. Each side called experts eminently qualified in their respective\nfields. Professor De Villiers, a retired\nvascular surgeon, Dr Harries-Jones, a\nconsultant radiologist and Dr Parker, a neurosurgeon, gave evidence for the\nplaintiff. Dr Stein,\na vascular surgeon, Professor Immelman, a vascular surgeon\nand the Head of the Vascular Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital, testified\non behalf\nof the defendant. Their evidence was helpful and illuminated many obscure and\ncomplicated aspects and contributed enormously\nto the understanding of the\nissues for decision in this case.\n[27]\tConfronted with the battery of\nexperts on either side, presenting competing and contrasting evidence, the\nlearned judge preferred\nthe evidence of the plaintiff’s experts to that of\nthe defendant without advancing any basis for so doing. All that he said\nwas\nthat the opinions of Professor De Villiers and Dr Parker are based on logical\nreasoning but he failed to give any demonstration\nof this. The learned judge did\nnot give equal credit to Drs de Kock and Stein and Professor Immelman whose\nviews he harshly dismissed\nas being incapable of logical analysis and support. I\ndo not share these views. The conclusion reached was clearly wrong. It is an\napproach which this court has recently decried in\nMichael and another\nv Linksfield Park Clinic (Pty)\nLtd\n,\n[8]\nwhere it was\nsaid:\n‘...it would be wrong to decide a case by simple preference where\nthere are conflicting views on either side, both capable of\nlogical support.\nOnly where expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all will it fail to\nprovide “the benchmark by reference\nto which the defendant’s conduct\nfalls to be assessed”.’\nThe uncritical acceptance of the evidence\nof Professor De Villiers and the plaintiff’s other expert evidence and the\nrejection\nof the evidence of the defendant’s expert witnesses falls short\nof the requisite standard and the approach laid down by this\ncourt in\nMichael\nv Linksfield Park Clinic\n. What was required of the trial judge was to\ndetermine to what extent the opinions advanced by the experts were founded on\nlogical\nreasoning and how the competing sets of evidence stood in relation to\none another, viewed in the light of the probabilities. I have\nalready indicated\nwhy I found the evidence adduced on behalf of the defendant to be more\nacceptable than that of the plaintiff’s\nwitnesses and why the conclusion\nof the trial court cannot stand.\n[28]\tIn the result the following order\nis made:\n1.\tThe appeal is upheld with costs, including the costs consequent upon the\nemployment of two counsel.\n2.\tThe order of the court\na quo\nis set aside and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n‘The plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs, including the\ncosts consequent upon the employment of two counsel.’\n__________________\nKK\nMTHIYANE\nJUDGE OF\nAPPEAL\nCONCUR:\nMPATI DP\nSTREICHER\nJA\nLEWIS JA\nPONNAN JA\n[1]\n2003 (1) SA 11\n(SCA).\n[2]\n2002 (4) SA 408\n(SCA)\npara 24.

    "facts": "The plaintiff, James Peter Oldwage, consulted a general practitioner on 5 June 2000 for intense right‑leg pain. He was referred to vascular surgeon Dr Henk Douw Louwrens, who examined him on 6 June, performed an angiogram on 7 June that showed multiple arterial occlusions in the right leg, and subsequently performed an iliac bi‑femoral bypass on 8 June. After the operation the plaintiff continued to experience pain and, on 14 June, consulted a neurosurgeon who diagnosed a prolapsed disc at L4/5 requiring a laminectomy, which was performed on 21 June. The plaintiff alleges that the vascular surgeon misdiagnosed his condition, failed to obtain proper informed consent, and that his subsequent left‑leg claudication is a result of the bypass (a ‘steal’ syndrome). Competing testimonies from the plaintiff, his relatives, the GP, the vascular surgeon, and several expert witnesses created a factual dispute over whether the primary problem at the time of the vascular consultation was vascular or neurological.",
    "issues": "The appeal raised four principal issues: (1) whether Dr Louwrens misdiagnosed the plaintiff’s condition as primarily vascular when it was actually neurological; (2) whether, assuming a correct diagnosis, the surgeon acted as a reasonable vascular specialist would have under the circumstances; (3) whether the plaintiff gave informed consent to the iliac bi‑femoral bypass and was adequately warned of material risks, including the possibility of steal syndrome; and (4) whether the plaintiff’s later left‑leg claudication was caused by the vascular operation.",
    "principles": "The court applied established medical‑negligence principles: a practitioner is liable only if the mistake is so palpably wrong as to indicate a lack of reasonable skill (Mitchell v Dixon); the standard of care for a specialist is that of a reasonable specialist in the same field; informed consent requires that the patient understand the nature, risks and alternatives of the proposed treatment (Castell v De Greef); and a duty to warn only arises where the risk is more than remote (Richter v Estate Hammann). The court also considered the approach to credibility and factual inference on appeal (Union Spinning Mills v Paltex Dye House; Michael v Linksfield Park Clinic).",
    "application": "The appellate court re‑evaluated the credibility of the parties’ accounts, finding the plaintiff’s evidence unreliable and inconsistent, while the doctors’ testimonies were coherent, corroborated by the angiogram, contemporaneous notes and the neurosurgeon’s own record of prior right‑leg pain. Consequently, the diagnosis of severe ischaemia was held correct and the bypass appropriate. The surgeon’s explanation of the procedure, the consent form and testimony demonstrated that informed consent was obtained; the alleged discrepancy in terminology was deemed a semantic issue. Expert testimony indicated that the risk of steal syndrome after the chosen bypass was between two and four percent, a probability the court considered negligible and not required to be disclosed. Hence no breach of duty was found on any of the four issues.",
    "conclusion": "The appeal was upheld. The order of the Cape High Court was set aside and replaced with a judgment dismissing the plaintiff’s action with costs, including the costs of both parties’ counsel."
